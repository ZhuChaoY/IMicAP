# ANI ranges report for assembly: GCA_000016525.1
# Submitted organism: Methanobrevibacter smithii ATCC 35061 (taxid = 420247, rank = no rank, lineage = Archaea; Methanobacteriati; Methanobacteriota; Methanomada group; Methanobacteria; Methanobacteriales; Methanobacteriaceae; Methanobrevibacter)
# Submitted Organism Has Type Assembly: Yes
# Best match: Methanobrevibacter smithii (taxid = 2173, rank = species, lineage = Archaea; Methanobacteriati; Methanobacteriota; Methanomada group; Methanobacteria; Methanobacteriales; Methanobacteriaceae; Methanobrevibacter)
# Status: CONFIRMED
# Confidence: HIGH
# Recommended actions legend:
#     - (dash) - No action, query nucleotide is not contaminated
#     S        - query nucleotide range is contaminated from within the same genus and could be considered for trimming, but it is still a valid component of assembly after trimming
#     T        - query nucleotide range is contaminated and needs to be trimmed, but it is still a valid component of assembly after trimming
