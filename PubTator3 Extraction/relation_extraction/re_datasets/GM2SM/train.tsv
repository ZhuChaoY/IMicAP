'@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$' do not harbor the hgcAB operon. This operon encodes an enzyme involved in the methylation of inorganic @sm$ mercury @/sm$ (@sm$ Hg @/sm$) to form the highly toxic methylmercury.	0
(149 metabolites), Akkermansia muciniphila (106 metabolites), @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ (105 metabolites), Methanobrevibacter smithii (96 metabolites), and Roseburia intestinalis (92 metabolites). In contrast, the top-five microbial metabolic pathways were associated with more than 53% of the faecal metabolites, with the pathways of l-rhamnose degradation I, Kdo transfer to lipid IVA III (Chlamydia), CDP diacylglycerol biosynthesis I and II and @sm$ NAD @/sm$ biosynthesis I from aspartate associating with 226, 218, 215, 215, and 206 faecal metabolites, respectively.	0
(2004) longitudinally evaluated the @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local antibiotic plus scaling and root planing (SRP). The predominant @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-resistant species included P. intermedia, Veillonela parvula, @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ and A. actinomycetemcomitans. The percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly in a time interval of 1 week in the @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time.	4
(2007) identified one strain as a new Bacteroides species, @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, and the type strain CRE21T is in collection (@gm$ DSM 14838 @/gm$, @gm$ CCUG 44979 @/gm$). The cells were Gram-negative, nonmotile, and nonsporulating rods. This newly identified cellulolytic bacterium grew on cellulose (Avicel, Sigmacell, and spinach cell wall) and exhibited poor growth on xylane. It consumed a great variety of sugars: glucose, saccharose, fructose, maltose, xylose, galactose, ribose, melibiose, mannose, lactulose, and galacturonic acid; and produced acetate, propionate, succinate, H2, @sm$ lactate @/sm$, and formate.	2
(2017) found these sequences along with @gm$ Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$ Mx1 could utilize the @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$, and that Escherichia spp. were important players in @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ production from choline and L-carnitine, which were also dominated in the rumen of sika deer at day 1.	2
(2021) published a comparable French study, where the intestinal microbiota of 63 patients who received (neo)adjuvant eight cycles of anthracycline or anthracycline-@sm$ taxane @/sm$-based therapy were analysed with metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Compared to baseline, richness increased after chemotherapy, which was in contrast with our study, where observed species richness significantly decreased after chemotherapy. Furthermore, the study by Terrisse et al. observed at the species level that chemotherapy increased the abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ and Ruminococcus torques and that chemotherapy tended to reduce the species of Clostridium asparagiforme, Bacteroides uniformis and Eggerthella lenta.	0
(60.5%), Trichomonas vaginalis (2.3%), @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ (34.9%) and/or Mobiluncus spp. (11.6%). The level of resistance was 27.9% (12/43) for penicillin G, 53.5% (23/43) for erythromycin, 25.6% (11/43) for clindamycin and 100% for tetracycline. However, the strains had retained fully susceptible to vancomycin and @sm$ teicoplanin @/sm$.	3
(@sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-sensitive and resistant Acinetobacter isolates) and 73 controls (uninfected patients) were included. The mean age of the infected patients was 61.7 +- 17.7 years with a male predominance (male:female ratio of 2:1). Culture specimens consist mostly of respiratory secretions (58%), followed by wound (22%), blood (12%), and urine (8%). Moreover, the microbiological distribution of the isolates was predominated by one species, namely Acinetobacter baumannii complex (70 isolates, 96%) with the other 4% distributed between @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ (2 isolates, 2.7%) and A. lwoffi (1 isolate, 1.3%). In addition, 40 patients (55%) had @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistant isolates, 26 of which were tested against colistin and found to be susceptible.	4
(Poly)phenols provide carbon sources (after microbial deglycosylation), act as electronic acceptors (as is the case with hydroxycinnamic acids) or generate proton motive forces during their metabolization (as is the case with @sm$ gallic acid @/sm$) (Figure 3). (Poly)phenols also promote the growth of Bacteroides spp. in vivo (Table 1). The bloom of this genus has been related to its capacity to use (poly)phenols as a trophic substrate. @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, a bacterial keystone from this genus, is recognized as a next-generation probiotic with carbohydrate-catabolic abilities.	2
(d) The abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ increased two-fold in the C group and forty-fold in the E group. (e) Plasma-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that, after eight weeks of BL-99 supplementation, the increases in @sm$ DHA @/sm$, adrenic acid, linoleic acid, and acetic acid and decreases in glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholic acid in the E group were significantly higher than those in the C group. (f) Spearman correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$' abundance and SCFAs, PUFAs, and bile acids.	1
(ii) The second isoform here tested from the Gram-negative bacterium @gm$ Vibrio Cholerae @/gm$, VchCA-beta, was less inhibited when compared to the alpha- as the associated KI values were comprised between high nanomolar to micromolar range (KI 82.9-7985 nM). On the other hand, compound 3f did not show any inhibitory activity against this isoform. The replacement of @sm$ sulfur @/sm$ with selenium atom by compounds 3a and 7a, also for this isoform, lead to increase the activity over 48 times (KI 4648 nM for 3a and 96.3 nM for 7a).	3
(isolated from stool) to chloramphenicol and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, as in our study was also found by Ansari et al.. But the antimicrobial treatment of diarrhea is only recommended in selected cases as those caused by @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ spp.	4
(most similar to strain DJF_B143), RUG133 a strain of @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ and RUG664 a strain of Streptococcus equinus. Bacillus licheniformis encodes both hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzymes as well as serine proteases and other important enzymes. Kandleria vitulina, relatively recently renamed, is a little-studied organism, although the family Erysiopelotrichaceae (of which it is a member) has been positively correlated with milk yield and negatively correlated with methane emissions. Acidaminococcus fermentans is a Gram-negative diplococcus that uses citrate as an energy source, producing hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide, which may explain its association with methane production in cattle (methanogens convert H2 with CO2 to CH4). Acidaminococcus fermentans has also been shown to decrease the accumulation of tricarballylate, a toxic end product of ruminal fermentation, by oxidizing trans-aconitate. Megasphaera spp. have been found in cattle, sheep and other ruminants. Megasphaera elsdenii's ability to produce a variety of VFAs is of interest to the chemical industry. Supplementation of the diet of dairy cows with M. elsdenii, which utilizes lactate as an energy source, has potential benefits for energy balance and animal productivity. @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ was first isolated from the rumen in 1991, has been shown to ferment starch with the production of @sm$ acetic @/sm$ and lactic acid and has been implicated in acidosis.	1
(n = 10), Citrobacter freundii (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 1), and @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (n = 1) with reduced susceptibility to FQ in Enterobacteriaceae. All the isolates exhibited exceptionally high-level resistance (MIC of 4-512mg/L) to all three FQs, which could not be reversed by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP), @sm$ verapamil @/sm$ (@sm$ VRP @/sm$) or reserpine (RSP).	4
(nitrate reducers) and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. (nitrite reducers) present on tongue dorsum increased. Moreover, Burleigh et al. showed that nitrate dietary supplementation in young individuals (age 27 +- 7 years) decreases blood pressure and increases both salivary and blood @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ levels. These authors also found that the rate of reduction of nitrate to @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ was dependent on the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria in the oral cavity. Individuals presenting a lower abundance of these bacteria presented a lower @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ salivary level. Interestingly, Vanhatalo et al. showed that the dietary nitrate supplementation (through consumption of nitrate rich concentrated beetroot juice) over 10 days of administration in young (18-22 years old) and older (70-79 years old) individuals led to an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (+225%) and a decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes (-46%) in saliva. Moreover, nitrate supplementation led to higher @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ blood levels and a reduction in the blood pressure of the older individuals. High abundances of Rothia spp. (+127%) and Neisseria spp. (+131%) and low abundances of Prevotella spp. (-60%) and Veillonella spp. (-65%) were correlated with greater increases in plasma @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ in response to nitrate supplementation.	1
(no detection in 25 g), Listeria monocytogenes (no detection in 25 g), @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ (100 CFU/g), anaerobic sulfite reducers (100 CFU/g), yeasts (1,000 CFU/g) and filamentous fungi (1,000 CFU/g). Analysis of four batches of the additive showed compliance with these limits, except for one batch regarding yeast counts (range 240-1,500 CFU/g).10 The same batches were tested for the following mycotoxins which were not detected: aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, and G2), @sm$ deoxynivalenol @/sm$, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B1 + B2, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin.	0

0.26%) were all reduced by @sm$ SB @/sm$ supplementation (P < 0.05), as well an unidentified member of the f.[Mogibacteriaceae] (0.65 vs. 1.56%) (Fig. 3b). A genus belonging to the Cyanobacterial YS2 order was increased by @sm$ SB @/sm$, as were Lachnospira (0.13 vs. 0.06%), @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ (1.40% vs. 0.66%), and a genus annotated as p-75-af belonging to Erysipelotrichaceae (0.31 vs. 0.11%; P < 0.05). A single genus from the Tenericutes phylum classified only as o. ML615J-28 was also increased in the @sm$ SB @/sm$ group (0.19 vs. 0.04%; P < 0.05). Additionally, an undetermined genus assigned to the Coriobacteriaceae family was reduced by @sm$ SB @/sm$ in the cecum (3.96 vs.	2
128 isolates of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species from admitted and outdoor patients were subjected to biotyping and resistotyping. Resistance phenotype analysis included nine antibiotics and two betalactam inhibitor combination drugs. In 100 strains of Acinetobacter spp. ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and @sm$ cefepime @/sm$ minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was done by agar dilution using NCCLS 2002 criteria. In forty-nine isolates MIC level was determined by E-strip also. Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production was detected by double disc synergy technique. Inducible beta lactamases (IBL's) were detected by disc approximation method. The relationship between biotypes and resistance phenotype was analyzed. Majority of isolates (93.75%) were from admitted patients. The biotyping revealed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex (87.2%) to be the predominant species and they were isolated from tracheal aspirates of patients with ventilator associated pneumonia. By Kirby Bauer disc diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity testing Acinetobacter spp. were most sensitive to the combination of drug cefoperazone-sulbactam (95.6%) followed by meropenem (94.6%), piperacillin-tazobactam (92.6%). On screening incidence of Imipenem Nonsensitive Acinetobacter spp. (INSA) was (5.4%). Acinetobacter spp. were typable by six resistance phenotypes and six biotypes. Most common (66.6%) resistant phenotype of A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex was susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam and or meropenem and or piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBL production was seen in 6% and IBL (Inducible Beta Lactamase) production was seen in 7% of Acinetobacter spp. The MIC90 for ciprofloxacin was =256 microg/ml, cefotaxime 512 microg/ml, @sm$ cefepime @/sm$ 512 microg/ml, and amikacin 32 microg/ml. Multidrug resistance was seen in more than 90% of A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex and 20% of @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$.	4
2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and @sm$ -acetophenones @/sm$ substituted by aminoalkoxy groups and related compounds (41-69, table ii) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were evaluated (table iii). Some of these compounds (e.g. 47, 52, and 59) suprisingly exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum including Proteus species and @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$.	3
2-Chloro-1-(5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethanone 8 synthesized by refluxing 5-pyrazolone 7 with chloroacetyl chloride in a basic @sm$ dioxane @/sm$ solution reacted with 2-aminobenzimidazole 9 to give N-(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-furo [2,3-c]pyrazol-4(5H)-ylidene)-1H-benzimidazol-2-amine 10 (Scheme 3). Compound 10 showed a very good anti-Gram-positive profile, being equivalent to chloramphenicol against @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ (MIC 3.125 mug mL-1), significant activity against B.	3
2-Hydroxy-2(3-phenoxyphenyl) acetonitrile was then converted into 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, which is considered a marker metabolic intermediate of cypermethrin and @sm$ pyrethroid @/sm$ degradation. Previous studies have reported that this step is catalyzed by oxynitrilase. The intermediate compound 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde appeared in small quantities during the initial phase of the experiment, but disappeared completely due to the effect of strain SG4. 3-Phenoxybenzaldehyde can be easily transformed via a bacterial system, as similarly reported by Birolli et al.. 3-Phenoxybenzaldehyde can be converted into 3-phenoxybenzoic acid using the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid can be converted into phthalic acid, which can further be converted into benzoic acid 2,5-dimethyl using the transferase family enzyme. This benzoic acid 2,5-dimethyl is further converted to phenol. These findings were similar to those previously reported in the literature. The bacterium successfully grows by using and converting this toxic insecticide into non-toxic metabolic compounds. Similar results have been observed with different strains of bacteria and fungi. Several degradation mechanisms for cypermethrin and other @sm$ pyrethroids @/sm$ have been identified in bacterial strains of Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$, Pseudomonas, and Brevibacterium, and fungal strains Aspergillus, Candidia, and Trichoderma.	2
2003) was created in 2003 and is composed of strictly anaerobic Gram-negative rods that resemble the Bacteroides fragilis group in that most species are bile-resistant and @sm$ indole @/sm$-positive. This genus is currently comprised of five species with validly published names, including @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$, A.	4
2006), @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ (Rautio et al. 2003), and A. shahii (Song et al. 2006). In addition, we recently described two new species, A. senegalensis (Mishra et al. 2012) and A. timonensis (Lagier et al. 2012) that were isolated from the digestive microbiota from an asymptomatic Senegalese patient. Members of the genus Alistipes are strictly anaerobic Gram-negative rods that are closely related to the Bacteroides fragilis group, with which they share the characteristic of bile-resistance and @sm$ indole @/sm$-positivity.	4
2B) and @sm$ pectin @/sm$-specific (Supplementary Fig. 2C) TSS are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism genes, while the most abundant functional category of cellulose-specific TSS is prophage genes (Supplementary Fig. 2D). The @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ genome includes a large prophage island that is not predicted to encode a viable phage, but whose transcription is up-regulated on cellulose and biomass (Supplementary Fig.	2
2c), @sm$ glucose @/sm$, fructose, arabinose, or xylose as sole carbon sources (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and introduction of the Bt rpoD promoter into the BamHI and SpeI sites increased activity tenfold independently of carbon source (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Introducing pBolux into @gm$ Bo @/gm$ produced similar results across all conditions and a plasmid preceded by the region upstream of the @gm$ Bo @/gm$ rpoD gene (BACOVA_00615) increased luminescence approximately tenfold (Supplementary Fig.	2
3-Phenoxybenzoic acid can be converted into phthalic acid, which can further be converted into @sm$ benzoic acid @/sm$ 2,5-dimethyl using the transferase family enzyme. This @sm$ benzoic acid @/sm$ 2,5-dimethyl is further converted to phenol. These findings were similar to those previously reported in the literature. The bacterium successfully grows by using and converting this toxic insecticide into non-toxic metabolic compounds. Similar results have been observed with different strains of bacteria and fungi. Several degradation mechanisms for cypermethrin and other pyrethroids have been identified in bacterial strains of Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$, Pseudomonas, and Brevibacterium, and fungal strains Aspergillus, Candidia, and Trichoderma.	2
30,000 THP-1-derived macrophages were seeded on a black 96-well plate and treated with EP4 agonist L-902688 (Cayman Chemicals) or vehicle control (0.01% [vol/vol] @sm$ DMSO @/sm$) in RPMI lacking antibiotics for 30 min prior to infection with GFP-expressing wild-type and YopJC172A @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ at an MOI of 15:1 for 1 h.	3
3A-C, gut microbiota was mainly enriched in the superpathway of @sm$ arginine @/sm$ and polyamine biosynthesis and NAD biosynthesis I (NAD+ anabolic pathway) functional pathways. Previous studies have revealed that the polyamine pathway and NAD and its associated metabolites are essential for the occurrence and progression of PD. Furthermore, the difference in bacteria associated with NAD+ anabolic pathways was also found. @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ had a higher abundance in PD patients, and Coprococcus had a higher abundance in healthy individuals (Fig. 3D). Cumulatively, gut microbiota may participate in the occurrence and development of PD through superpathway of @sm$ arginine @/sm$ and polyamine biosynthesis and NAD+ anabolic pathways.	1
50 muL of hybridization solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9 M NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, with 10% (v/v) @sm$ formamide @/sm$ stored at 100%, pre-warmed to 50 C) were added to the FISH probes of interest (final 0.5 mug/probe) and spotted onto each section. Probes specific to Bacteroides (CCAATGTGGGGGACCTT), Lachnospiraceae (TCTTCCCTGCTGATAGA), and @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ (TCACGCGGCGTTGCTC) were used.	3
50 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from human material are identified by biochemical tests (bile esculin, Cl Na 6,5%, acid production from lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin, arginine, esculin and starch hydrolysis; production of levan and dextran in sucrose media) Streptococcus salivarius and @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ are predominant species. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied: 70% of viridans streptococci were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, high level resistance to @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ was not present.	4
7), a significant separation (NMDS cluster) was observed between female and male mice that were fed the @sm$ vitamin D @/sm$-supplemented diet throughout the experiment with OVA-induced allergic airway disease (Fig. 10b; Table 3 for ANOSIM bacterial variance). There was a significant effect of allergic airway disease on the relative proportion of OTUs detected in mice. The most abundant OTUs detected, which each accounted for >1 % of the sequences after normalization, are shown for the naive mice, or, mice with allergic airway disease in Fig. 11a. Proportions of the environmental microbial group GNO2 (Naive, mean = 9.5 %; OVA, mean = 0.0 %) and an unassigned bacterial OTU (Naive, mean = 1.1 %; OVA, mean = 0.0 %) were reduced in mice with OVA-induced allergic airway disease, while @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ (Naive, mean = 1.29 %; OVA, mean = 1.8 %), Chloroplast (Naive, mean = 0.1 %, OVA, mean = 5.0), Comamonadaceae (Naive, mean = 0.1 %; OVA, mean = 4.0.%), Cyanobacteria (Naive, mean = 0.1 %; OVA, mean = 1.0 %) Staphylococcus (Naive, mean = 0.5 %; OVA, mean = 1.2 %), Micrococcaceae (Naive, mean = 0.1 %; OVA, mean = 1.8 %) and Verrucomicrobiaceae (Naive, mean = 0.1 %; OVA, mean = 7.6 %) OTUs, and an OTU assigned to Peptostreptococcaceae (Naive, mean = 1.0 %; OVA, mean = 1.5 %) were increased by the induction of allergic airway disease. The @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ OTU significantly increased in the OVA samples was not the same @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ OTU identified as responsible for largely driving the difference between male and female mice fed a @sm$ vitamin D @/sm$-containing diet throughout the experiment.	0
8f), and TCA concentration was negatively correlated with the log2(abundance) of @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$ and B. wadsworthia (Fig. 6b). Across all participants, we analysed our 440 high-quality MAGs (completeness of >90% and contamination of <10%, dereplicated to 99% average nucleotide identity (ANI)) and searched for the canonical BSH gene in each using a hidden Markov model. We found putative BSH genes in A. hadrus (7 of 8 MAGs) and @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ (4 of 4 MAGs), in accordance with previous literature. By contrast, none of the 12 F. prausnitzii MAGs nor the 3 B. wadsworthia MAGs contained any putative BSH genes, suggesting that these taxa may use @sm$ glycine @/sm$ and taurine generated by other microbial deconjugation reactions.	2
@gm$ A. caccae @/gm$, one of the most abundant bacterial groups in the human colon (Falony et al.,), has been described as a butyrate-producing intestinal microorganism (Schwiertz et al.,; Duncan et al.,). To our knowledge, pentose metabolism has not yet been described for @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$. Our data indicate that both pentoses applied are metabolized, whereby @sm$ ribose @/sm$ is more than arabinose.	2
@gm$ A. fermentans @/gm$ thrives mainly by glutamate fermentation via the 2-hydroxyglutarate pathway in the intestinal tract of homeothermic animals, utilizing glutamate, @sm$ citrate @/sm$, and trans-aconitate as sole energy sources, in the presence of sodium. Ammonia, acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen are the main end products of growth. Transport and catabolism of these substrates are dependent on a sodium motive force as a method of membrane energetics. The fermentation of trans-aconitate in strain VR4T takes a different pathway, which is via @sm$ citrate @/sm$, oxaloacetate, and pyruvate, producing CO2, acetate, butyrate and hydrogen. Unlike the @sm$ citrate @/sm$ uptake, the aconitate uptake may adopt two mechanisms: a @sm$ citrate @/sm$/aconitate carrier with low affinity for sodium and an aconitate carrier with high affinity for sodium.	2
@gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ is a fully-sequenced Bacteroidetes resident of the human gut that can be propagated in an oxygen-free environmental chamber. We began with a bioinformatics analysis of the enzymes in bacterial fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis to provide a roadmap for the investigation of fatty acid metabolism in this organism (Table 1). Phospholipid synthesis is composed of 4 modules. First, acetyl-CoA generated from central metabolism is activated into malonyl-CoA in the initiation module. @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ is not predicted to encode homologs of known acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex genes (accABCD) but does encode homologs of the malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase (FabD) and 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) (Table 1). Second, a four-enzyme repetitive cycle extends the chain length of the acyl-ACP in the elongation module. There are two enzymes predicted to carry out the enoyl-ACP reductase step, FabI and FabK (Table 1). There is no evidence for genes (fabA, fabB, fabM, etc.) required to introduce double bonds into the growing acyl chain leading to the clear prediction that @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ does not synthesize unsaturated fatty acids. @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ is predicted to encode for the PlsX/Y/C pathway for phosphatidic acid synthesis in the acyltransfer module (Table 1), which is found in all characterized bacterial taxa except Gammaproteobacteria. The only known phospholipid @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ is predicted to synthesize is @sm$ PE @/sm$ (Table 1).	1
"@gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ was one of the seven taxa found to be in greater abundance in healthy and low PA PI-IBS humanized mice, while several species of Bacteroides were in greater abundance in high PA mice (Fig 4, f and g; for identification of labeled taxa see extended figure 5, a and b). A random forest machine learning algorithm again identified the genus Alistipes as a major predictor of low PA status, with @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ as the most significantly associated species (Fig. 4h). Furthermore, an ROC curve with an AUCROC of 0.914 was generated (extended figure 5c). Nine predicted KEGG pathways were predicted to be significantly different between the healthy and high PA groups (extended figure 5d). The top predicted pathways elevated in high PA humanized mice were ""aromatic degradation"" and ""mineral and organic ion transport"", whereas the ""@sm$ polyamine @/sm$ biosynthesis"" pathways were increased in healthy humanized mice (Fig."	1
@gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ belongs to the group of strictly anaerobic gram-negative cocci. All previously described @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. An A. fermentans strain (RYC-MR95) resistant to penicillin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (amoxicillin and @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$ MICs, 64 microgram/ml) was isolated from a human perianal abscess. A fragment encoding a beta-lactamase from genomic DNA was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12 strain HB101, and the recombinant strain expressed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC, 1,024 microgram/ml) and @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$ (MIC, 4 microgram/ml).	4
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is an aerobic and non-fermenting bacterium, which can widely distribute in surrounding environments. Some species of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ have the ability to thrive in an environment without oxygen when @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is present as a substrate and their optimum growth temperature (Han et al., ). In this study, a certain proportion of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ (@gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ and Acinetobacter lwoffii at species level) was found in all groups of oat silages stored at 25 C after 60 days of ensiling. Additionally, many undesired bacteria including @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Enterococcus and Hafnia were identified as the differently expressed genus in the 25L group by LEfSe analysis. In agreement, several studies also found that @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ has existed in the different fermentation stages of ensiled forages such as sugarcane, King grass and Sorghum-Sudangrass hybrid silages (Chen et al., ; Dong et al., ; Muraro et al., ). Therefore, a higher abundance @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ in oat silages at 25 C may result from the increased @sm$ acetate @/sm$ concentration and optimum growth temperature of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ at 25 C versus 15 C.	2
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. are able to survive for a prolonged time on dry inanimate surfaces; the duration of which has been reported from one up to 5 months. A. baumannii strains are easily colonized in patients or medical equipment. Specific strains can attach to human epithelial cells through fimbriae or @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ side chains, bind to salivary mucins, or develop biofilm in contact with plastic or glass surfaces.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ strains were grown at 30 C in mineral salts (MS) medium (NaNO3 0.5 g, K2HPO4 0.65 g, KH2PO4 0.17 g, MgSO4 0.10 g per liter) supplemented with phenol or sodium lactate, or in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 C in LB medium. When necessary, ampicillin (20 microg/ml), kanamycin (50 microg/ml), and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (50 microg/ml) were added to the medium.	3
@gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ (@gm$ ATCC #17908 @/gm$) was grown aerobically in nutrient agar (BD). Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC #14917) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC #53103) were grown aerobically in MRS broth (BD). All bacteria were counted using CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Syto 9 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the LSR II. Bacteria were frozen as dry cell pellets until reconstituted in @sm$ PBS @/sm$ for use in stimulations.	0
@gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ can pose a great threat to survival of freshwater fish. In this study, @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ challenge could promote the erythrocyte hemolysis, increase free hemoglobin (FHB) level and generate malondialdehyde (MDA) production in plasma but decrease the levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lysozyme (LZM) of red crucian carp (RCC, 2 N = 100) and triploid hybrid fish (3 N fish, 3 N = 150) following @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ challenge. Elevated expression levels of heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90alpha), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), paraoxonase 2 (PON2) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) were observed in @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$-infected fish. In addition, @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ challenge could significantly increase expressions of cortisol, leucine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$, glutamate and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in RCC and 3 N, while glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle appeared to be inactive.	2
@gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ (type strain YIT 12060T; DSM 22520T; JCM 16068T) was the next species to be discovered. It was isolated from human feces. This species is slightly different, since its shape is more coccoid than rod-shaped, as well as its inability to hydrolyze @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ to indole.	2
@gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$ and   Clostridium  saccharolyticum  are able to utilize carbohydrates or polysaccharides as carbon source. These bacteria are able to produce @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and butyrate as fermented products.   Adlercreutzia  equolifaciens  has ability to produce equol, a nonsteroidal estrogen which has beneficial effects on the incidence of prostate cancer and reduces experimental cutaneous inflammation in mice.   Lactobacillus  intestinalis  in class Bacilli, phylum Firmicutes is a potential probiotic strain.   Anaerovorax  odorimutans  is a putrescine-fermenting bacterium which changes putrescine to @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate, and ammonia as metabolic products.	1
@gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$ strain PC1T (= @gm$ DSM 20548 @/gm$ = @gm$ ATCC 9321 @/gm$ = @gm$ JCM 6508 @/gm$) is the type strain of the species and the type species of the genus. Six strains of the species were characterized by Foubert and Douglas in 1948, originally designated as '@gm$ Micrococcus prevotii @/gm$', but subsequently placed in the genus Peptococcus. Based on a comparative study published by Ezaki et al., the type strain of @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$ was then transferred to the genus 'Peptostreptococcus' and later on assigned to the novel genus @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ as @gm$ A. prevotii @/gm$. The organism is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, indole-negative coccus. The major metabolic end product from metabolism of peptone-yeast-@sm$ glucose @/sm$ (PYG) is butyric acid. @gm$ A. prevotii @/gm$ was provisionally assigned to the arranged family 'Peptostreptococcaceae' within the order Clostridiales, also designated as Family XI Incertae sedis. Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for @gm$ A. prevotii @/gm$ strain PC1T together with the description of the complete genomic sequencing and annotation.	2
@gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ is shown to play an important role in changing some mucin degradation related gene expression of bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila, thus indirectly supporting the microbial community in the mucosal environment. The decreased richness of @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ might be responsible for the decreased microbial richness and diversity in SE challenged broilers. The enriched abundance of family Ruminococcaceae and Lachnoclostridium in @sm$ VC @/sm$ treatment groups may contribute to the higher microbial diversity and richness, as the 2 family members are positively correlated with microbial diversity. Because high diversity is the hallmark of a well-functioning, healthy gut ecosystem and reduced microbial diversity has been found in certain kinds of diseases, and the microbial richness and diversity could possibly explain the changed production performance in SE challenged or @sm$ VC @/sm$ treatment groups.	0
@gm$ B dentium @/gm$ and y-glutamylcysteine suppress @sm$ thapsigargin @/sm$ and tunicamycin-induced ER stress in mucin-producing cell lines.	3
@gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection induces apoptosis of osteoblast. Cortisol is not able to induce apoptosis in uninfected osteoblast. However, it has been demonstrated an inhibitory effect of apoptosis by DHEA treatment. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if cortisol and DHEA could modulate osteoblast apoptosis upon infection with @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$. Cortisol treatment significantly increased osteoblast apoptosis induced by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection as determined after 24 h postinfection by annexin V-@sm$ propidium iodide @/sm$ (PI) and analyzed by flow cytometry; and confirmed by TUNEL and Hoechst 33342 staining (Figure 2). By contrast, DHEA inhibits osteoblast apoptosis upon @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection. Moreover, DHEA could reverse the increasing apoptotic effect observed with cortisol; since when experiments were performed with both cortisol and DHEA, DHEA was also able to reverse the apoptotic effect of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection in the presence of cortisol treatment (Figure 2).	0
@gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ possesses a single nitrate reductase, so it is likely that the phenotype of the moaA mutant comes from the simultaneous deficiency of Nar and other enzymes dependent on the molybdenum cofactor. It could be the case of MSF, a nitrate-nitrite antiporter, as well as FdnG, a formate dehydrogenase involved in @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ respiratory chain. Importantly, the occurrence of external N-nitrosation events is relevant for alkylating stress only if metabolites are present in the environment. Indeed, alkylating stress is generated by those modified metabolites, and not by N-nitrosation per se. It has been proposed that the eBCV is deficient in metabolites, which could explain why host cells do not produce detectable exogenous alkylating agents. Another important point is that N-nitrosation reactions are dependent on RNS levels and @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ is known to be very weakly immunogenic, as it prevents proinflammatory responses in macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ possesses a gene coding for a nitric oxide reductase, involved in detoxification of NO and @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ respiration, which is required and overexpressed by the bacterium early during infection. One interesting hypothesis is that by avoiding exogenous sources of alkylating stress, @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ generates weak endogenous stress. Indeed, as @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ activates its @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ respiration/denitrification pathway inside host cells, it must probably also generate endogenous N-nitroso compounds and hence endogenous alkylating agents.	2
"@gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 6 mL fresh CHG containing containing 100 muM @sm$ taurine @/sm$-conjugated bile acid pool. Cultures were allowed to grow anaerobically at 37  C for 21 h. Decreasing concentrations of 7 were added to different tubes and the cultures were incubated anaerobically at 37  C for 1 h. 10 muM 7-N3 was then added to the cultures and incubated anaerobically at 37  C for an additional hour. The cultures were further processed as per the reported method in ""Target Validation and Off-target Profiling in @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ using 7-N3"" and ""Click Chemistry for In-gel Fluorescence Imaging""."	2
@gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ was originally identified as a pathogen of Iridaceae, specifically irises and gladioli, and then later was recognized as the cause of infections in certain groups of immunocompromised patients, particularly among those with CF and CGD (Boyanton et al.,; Kennedy et al.,). The @sm$ iron @/sm$ acquisition systems of this organism have yet to be determined. However, the genome sequence offers a few clues. We note that it does not contain orthologs of the genes for the biosynthesis of ornibactin, malleobactin, pyochelin, or cepaciachelin (Table 1). However, it does contain orthologs of the bhuRSTUV genes. Unusually, these genes are organized into two separate operons that are present on chromosome 1 (bhuRST) and chromosome 2 (bhuUV) (results not shown), but nevertheless suggest that @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ may be able to utilize haem as an @sm$ iron @/sm$ source during infection of human hosts. The @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ genome also encodes a FtrABCD system.	2
@gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ has a full gene set for a functional tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate shunt. This seems to contrast with some methylotrophs, including some that use the RuMP pathway, that do not need a complete TCA to fulfill their energy requirements. Results (Fig. 2A) indicated that the TCA cycle was used much less than the RuMP pathway on methanol, with absolute flux of 0.62 mmol/g (dry cell weight)/h (i.e., 0.12 C-mmol/C-mmol) up to @sm$ isocitrate @/sm$ (ICit) and almost no flux afterwards (Fig.	2
@gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ is a primary example of RuMP-pathway-utilizing bacteria. During cleavage, F6P is either converted to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBP) by the FBP aldolase variant and subsequently to @sm$ glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate @/sm$ (@sm$ GAP @/sm$) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), or 2-keto-3-deoxy-6- phosphogluconate (KDGP) by the KDGP aldolase variant and subsequently converted to pyruvate.	2
@gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ strains were cultivated in triplicate cultures using inoculum made from exponentially growing cells (Brautaset et al.,; Naerdal et al.,). Samples for amino acid measurements were collected during the late exponential and stationary growth phases as described previously (Jakobsen et al.,; Naerdal et al.,), and measurements of cadaverine and amino acids were performed by using 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC) or @sm$ o-phthaldialdehyde @/sm$ derivatization and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Jakobsen et al.,; Brautaset et al.,; Schneider and Wendisch,).	0
@gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ was grown in BM medium (DSMZ Medium No. 1192) at pH 7.0 (37.4 g/L marine broth (Difco), 0.02 g/L biotin, 0.001 g/L vitamin B12, and 4 mL/L methanol). P. thermoglucosidasius was cultivated in TGP broth, pH 7.0 (17 g/L tryptone (Oxoid), 3 g/L soy peptone (Oxoid), 5 g/L NaCl, 2.5 g/L K2HPO4, and post-autoclaved addition of filter-sterilized pyruvate and @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ to final concentrations of 4 g/L and 4 mL/L).	2
@gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ was grown in BHI medium (supplemented 5% FBS) supplemented with metformin (0, 40 muM, 1.5 mM and 10 mM) in the dark for 7 h. Bacterial membrane potential were detected using BacLight  Bacterial Membrane Potential Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, E. coli or @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ were resuspended in 1X PBS and treated with either 10 mM @sm$ EDTA @/sm$ for 5 min or 10 min. The @sm$ EDTA @/sm$-treated bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in 1X PBS.	3
@gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ infects the lower GI tract of chickens, swine, horses, dogs, humans, and other animals. Upon entry via the oral cavity, the bacterium that survives passage through the stomach acid reaches the intestinal lumen. Using chemotaxis, the organism migrates towards the mucus and the intestinal wall. Indeed, @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ has a high number of genes coding for chemotaxis towards the mucus in comparison to other known bacterial species, providing a significant advantage to colonise the host. The mucus is a viscous matrix composed of two stratums, the inner and outer layers, which form a physical barrier and protect the intestinal cells from bacterial infections by limiting their motility. The unique shape of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$, combined with the production of specific enzymes that hydrolyse the mucus inner layer (sialidase family-like proteins), confers them the ability to swim through this medium and allow them to reach the cell wall. These are high virulence factors associated with tissue damage. Another virulence factor may be the noted sensitivity of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ to the chemo-attractant @sm$ serine @/sm$, which is found in high concentration in the mucus secreted by goblet cells.	3
@gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ isolates are susceptible to tetracycline, @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$, ceftriaxone, meropenem, and chloramphenicol, as determined by susceptibility testing. Treatment typically consists of oral @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$, with adults taking 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days.	3
@gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ NjM1 produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$, and both the bacterium and sodium acetate are protective against IAV infection. However, it is important to note that WT mice co-housed with Nlrp3-/- mice (Co-WT) survived 100%, and their weight loss did not exceed 10% (Fig. 1a); in contrast, WT mice gavaged with the NjM1 strain still exhibited clear weight loss, although significantly less than in the control group (Fig. 3a). These data demonstrate that there are other protective bacteria besides the @sm$ acetate @/sm$-producing NjM1 in the gut of Co-WT mice against IAV infection; but NjM1 is the one that can colonize WT mice during co-housing and produce @sm$ acetate @/sm$ to exert a protective function, even though it is not the only one. Similarly, although multiple metabolites may account for the protective effect of NjM1 against IAV infection, @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is likely to be one of the most important. An acetokinase, whose gene is located at 1517624-1518847 bp in the genome of @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ NjM1, should be the key enzyme that controls the final production of @sm$ acetate @/sm$. Since genetic manipulation of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ is rather challenging for the time being, we may generate mutant strain to show the direct effect of acetokinase in NjM1 on @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production, as well as the compromised effect of such mutant strain on IAV protection in future.	1
@gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ strains were isolated from fresh natto (Ton Color , Zielona Gora, Poland). All components of the culture media, i.e., peptone, yeast extract, casein peptone, glucose, NaCl, acetoin, L-threonine, NaOH, HCl, microbial agar, were supplied by Merck  (Darmstadt, Germany). Pyrazines' standards (2-methylpyrazine, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, @sm$ 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine @/sm$) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich  (St.	1
@gm$ B. suis @/gm$ M1330 [@gm$ ATCC 23444 @/gm$] and derivative strains were grown at 37 C in Bacto Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Bacto). When necessary antibiotics were added: chloramphenicol (6 microg/ml), kanamycin (50 microg/ml) and nalidixic acid (10 microg/ml). HeLa cells and lung epithelial A549 (ATCC CCL 185) cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO), and murine J774 macrophages in RPMI (GIBCO) media; both supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (PAA), at 37 C in a 5% @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ atmosphere.	3
@gm$ B. suis @/gm$ total membranes were prepared similarly as previously described. Briefly, 100 ml of TSB cultures at an OD600  1 were harvested by centrifuging 10 min at 5,000 x g, suspended in Protoplasting buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.45 M sucrose, 8 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF and 2 mg/ml lysozyme for the wt strain and 1 mg/ml for the  mapB mutant) and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then centrifuged 10 min at 4,200 x g and then suspended in Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 5 mM @sm$ MgCl2 @/sm$, 1 mM PMSF, 10 ug/ml DNaseI, 2ug/ml RNase) and disrupted using Precellys24 (Bertin technologies): 7 cycles of 3 x 30 sec at 6,500 rpm, incubating on ice between each cycle.	0
@gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ is capable of producing the SCFA's acetate, propionate, and the propionate precursor, succinate. Which SCFAs are formed depends on the type of fermentable substrate, generation time, and incubation period. In media supplemented with readily fermentable carbohydrates (i.e., glucose), the main SCFA produced by @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ is acetate, whereas propionate is generally favored with complex carbohydrates and under carbon source limitation. After extracting the BHI medium blank, propionate was under the limit of detection in supernatants of cells treated with both BPF concentrations. In some @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species, the main storage product is succinate. Here, only acetate could be detected in concentrations in line with previous studies of @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$. In the main pathway of acetogenesis, pyruvate is decarboxylated, leading to @sm$ ATP @/sm$ synthesis. Hence, the high concentrations excreted assume acetate as an important energy-conserving by-product of @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ after BPF exposure, as previously reported for E.	1
@gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ strains may have acquired functions related to host mucin metabolism, due to the lack of fiber available in the captive-ape diet. This situation is similar to what has been observed in B. thetaiotaomicron, which opportunistically metabolizes host-derived @sm$ glycans @/sm$ when plant-derived @sm$ glycans @/sm$ are absent from the diet. Moreover, the presence of additional carrageenan genes in captive-ape-associated strains may be a consequence of additives present in their diet, since carrageenan is ingredient in primate food sources (e.g., Mazuri ) recommended by the AZA and an additive in processed foods. It is noteworthy that the ability for strains of various Bacteroides species, including @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, to metabolize carrageenan is attributable to HGT events originally from marine bacteria.	2
@gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$ was grown in batch culture on 12 different carbon sources (five @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, seven monosaccharides and disaccharides). Specific growth rates were determined for each substrate together with polysaccharidase and glycosidase activities. Growth rates on polymerized carbohydrates were as fast or faster than on corresponding simple sugars, demonstrating that the rate of @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ depolymerization was not a factor limiting growth. @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$ synthesized a large range of polymer-degrading enzymes. These polysaccharidases and glycosidases were generally repressed during growth on simple sugars, but arabinose was required for optimal production of alpha-arabinofuranosidase. Polysaccharidase and glycosidase activities were measured in continuous cultures grown with either xylan or guar gum under putative carbon limitation. With the exception of beta-xylosidase, activities of the polymer-degrading enzymes were inversely related to growth rate. This correlated with @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ utilization which was greatest at low dilution rates. These results show that Bact. ovatus is highly adapted for growth on polymerized carbohydrate in the human colon and confirm that the utilization of @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ is partly regulated at the level of enzyme synthesis.	2
@gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ exhibited cross-feeding by enabling the growth of other beneficial bacteria during co-culture in RMD medium. In metabolome analysis, total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were highly produced in the following order: RMD, FOS, MOS, and Ad-FOS; @sm$ acetate @/sm$ in the order of FOS, MOS/RMD, and Ad-FOS; butyrate in the order of RMD, MOS, FOS, and Ad-FOS; and propionate only in RMD.	1
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ can increase the number of peripheral leukocytes so that the immune function is enhanced through the proliferation of Bifidobacteria. At the same time, XOS can increase the number of blood monocytes, serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and lysozyme activity. As an immune adjuvant, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ can recognize PP lymph nodes, activate intestinal lymph nodes, and induce lymphocyte outflow through lymphatic vessels; the immune system of the body is activated through lymphatic circulation. In addition, @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ directly bind to sugar receptors on the surface of immune cells to stimulate immune cell differentiation and increase activity; XOS can also be used as foreign antigens to effectively and permanently stimulate the immune system and promote the cell division and development of immune organs.	2
@gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$ is one of the most widely distributed and abundant @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ in the human intestine, and has been proven to have a variety of physiological functions. In this study, 80 strains of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ isolated from human subjects were classified into subspecies by ANI and phylogenetic analyses, and the functional genes were compared. The results showed that there were significant differences in carbohydrate metabolism between the two subspecies, which determined their preference for human milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ or plant-derived carbohydrates. The predicted exopolysaccharide (EPS) gene clusters had large variability within species but without difference at the subspecies level. Four subtype CRISPR-Cas systems presented in @gm$ B. longum @/gm$, while the subtypes I-U and II-C only existed in B. longum subsp. longum. The bacteriocin operons in B. longum subsp. infantis were more widely distributed compared with B. longum subsp. longum. In conclusion, this study revealed the similarities and differences between B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum, which could provide a theoretical basis for further exploring the probiotic characteristics of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$.	2
@gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ was positively correlated with waist (r = 0.47) and inversely with a number of metabolic markers including BMI (r = -0.26), @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ (r = -41), insulin (r = -0.46), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.43).	0
@gm$ Blautia @/gm$ species are one of the most dominant intestinal epithelial barrier-associated bacteria, which belongs to the Lachnospiraceae family and Firmicutes phylum. @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ species are strictly anaerobic, non-motile bacteria with spherical or oval morphologies. They can assimilate various carbohydrates such as glucose, @sm$ fructose @/sm$, lactose, mannose, arabinose and xylose, CO and H2/CO2, and produces acetic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid and ethanol. It is suggested from gene expression analysis that the tendency of assimilation of carbohydrates of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ species is lower than that of lactic acid bacteria. There is a negative correlation between the abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ and the markers of obesity-related metabolic disorders when fed with maize-derived non-digestible feruloylated oligo- and polysaccharides, potato fibers and soy milk. Intestinal microbes of Japanese people contained a high abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium and a low abundance of Bacteroides. Considering that @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ has a strong taxonomic association with twin inheritance, there might be a genetic preference of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ towards the intestine of specific genetic background. @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ species are also linked to abnormal Paneth cell counts, Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. @gm$ B. coccoides @/gm$ in the intestine increases with glucosylceramide in an animal model, but decreases with pectins and flavanones in humans. @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ species produce useful secondary metabolites such as chrysin, apigenin, desmethyllicaritin, 3'desmethyllarctigenin, bisdemethylcurcmin, demethyldemethoxycurcumin and ceramide in the intestine.	1
@gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ (formerly @gm$ Serpulina pilosicoli @/gm$) causes swine spirochaetosis and can also be isolated fro human faeces, although its role in human disease remains unclear. The genetic and biochemical variations amongst 19 isolates of human spirochaetes from five different countries were evaluated and compared to those found amongst swine isolates of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$. All isolates were negative for beta-glucosidase and all but one were positive for hippurate hydrolysis, which are characteristics typical of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$. The isolates showed variation in @sm$ indole @/sm$ production and alpha-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase activity, other characteristics which can be used to identify @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$. The DNA sequences of part of the 16S rRNA gene differed from each other and from that of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ by 0-3 bp out of 283 bp. It is concluded that there is considerable variation amongst human intestinal spirochaetes. Since few of the isolates reported here match the current criteria for @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$, it is concluded that this species is more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.	0
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ might randomly lose the O-antigen of @sm$ LPS @/sm$ during mutant construction, which was an important interference factor for assessing @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ virulence.	4
@gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ is an emerging, zoonotic disease predominantly affecting dogs and humans that engage in feral pig hunting in Australia and other countries. Although B. suis infection in dogs shares some clinical similarities to the host-adapted species (B. canis), @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ remains an incompletely understood pathogen in dogs with limited published data on its pathogenesis and clinical features. This case series describes the presentations, diagnosis, and clinical management of B. suis infection in three dogs: (1) a bitch with dystocia, abortion and mastitis; (2) an entire male dog with septic arthritis and presumptive osteomyelitis; and (3) a castrated male dog with lymphadenitis. Unique features of these cases are reported including the first documented detection of @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ from milk and isolation from lymph nodes of canine patients, as well as the follow-up of pups born to a @gm$ B. suis @/gm$-infected bitch. Consistent with previous reports, all three dogs showed a favourable clinical response to combination antibiotic therapy with @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ and doxycycline. Individually tailored drug regimens were required based on the clinical presentation and other factors, including owner expectations and compliance with therapy as well as a zoonotic risk assessment (generally considered low, except around time of whelping). The authors include their recommendations for the clinical management of dogs that are at-risk or seropositive for @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ with or without clinical signs or laboratory-confirmed infection.	3
@gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ (4 x 108 cfu/mL) was heated to 80  C for 30 min to kill the bacteria. HKC was freeze-dried as a powder and maintained at 4  C until use. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine at 37  C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. RAW 264.7 cells (4 x 105 cells/mL) were seeded in six-well plates and co-treated with HKC (300 mug/mL) and test samples. NO and @sm$ PGE2 @/sm$ production were determined according to previously described methods.	0
@gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ and C. tetani produce high levels of toxins in complex media rich in peptones and other nutrients, whereas chemically defined media even containing almost all amino acids and vitamins as well as a carbon source usually yield 10- to 100-fold lower toxin titers. Licona-Cassani et al. showed that, although C. tetani grew in a chemically defined medium, toxin production was obtained only when casein-derived peptides were added to the medium. In addition to variations in toxin production according to different media, variations in BoNT or TeNT yields are often observed from batch to batch of the same culture medium, even using the same bacterial strain. The transcription of neurotoxin genes and toxin synthesis occur mainly within a short time interval between the late exponential growth and early stationary growth phase. Thus, nutritional and environmental factors influence the regulation of toxin synthesis in @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ and C. tetani, which takes place in a restricted phase of bacterial growth. Peptides and amino acids appear to be important regulatory factors at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Indeed, large amounts (0.8-0.9 g/L) of amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, serine, histidine, threonine) downregulate tetR and tent by a yet non-identified regulatory pathway. Arginine is an essential amino acid for @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ growth, but an excess of arginine represses BoNT production in proteolytic group I @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$. Arginine deiminase leads to arginine catabolites that increase the pH and induce subsequent BoNT degradation by not yet characterized proteases. BoNT and botulinum complexes are stable at acidic pH in media without excess of arginine. Supplementation with a high amount of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ (50 g/L) that induces acidification counteracts the effect of arginine.	2
@gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ has the capacity to produce most TCA cycle intermediates, which donate reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain for energy metabolism (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S1). Although a fumarate hydratase was initially annotated in @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$, the genes are more likely to encode tartrate dehydratase based on sequence identity. @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ encodes aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspA); aspartate is a likely source of fumarate in @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$, in addition to fumarate directly sourced from the host diet. The genome encodes transporters for the uptake of both aspartate and fumarate. The inability to use proline and @sm$ serine @/sm$ by @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ (Fig. 3, Additional file 6: Table S6 and Additional file 7: Table S7) is interesting as proline utilization is considered important for C. jejuni intestinal colonization of mice, and @sm$ serine @/sm$ utilization is critical for C.	2
@gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ ferment lactose, sucrose and @sm$ inositol @/sm$ with the production of gas, produce a stormy clot fermentation with milk, reduce nitrate, hydrolyze gelatin and produce lecithinase and acid phosphatase.	2
@gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is capable of breaking down the recalcitrant, insoluble components of plant cell walls including cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and @sm$ starch @/sm$ as well as switchgrass, corn stover and pulp wastes that have been minimally processed without thermo-chemical pretreatment (Fig 2). Numerous carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) predicted to be involved in the degradation of various plant cell wall components are encoded throughout the @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ genome, including glycoside hydrolases (GH), polysaccharide lyases (PL) and carbohydrate esterases (CE). The diversity of GH families in the @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ genome is unparalleled among sequenced clostridial genomes (Fig 3). A total of 116 GHs distributed among 44 families are encoded in the genome of @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ including but not limited to endo- and exo-cellulases, hemicellulases, chitinases, pectinases, amylases, and lichenases (Fig 3 and S4 File). Only the GH content of a distant relative in Cluster I, Clostridium cellulovorans, is comparable, with 113 GH domains distributed among 37 families (Fig 3). A closer relative of @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus (Fig 3), has a comparable number of GH domains (113), but less diversity with only 25 families and no exo-cellulase (GH48).	2
@gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$, E. coli and Salmonella strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth with vigorous shaking or agar at 37 C unless otherwise stated. Antibiotics were used where indicated at the following concentrations: @sm$ Chloramphenicol @/sm$ at 10 and 20 microg ml-1, respectively for L.	3
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ is one of the most important causes of food-borne infectious diseases. Antibiotics are rarely needed to treat campylobacteriosis, but occasionally used in severe or prolonged cases. Consumption of contaminated bovine liver is a source of campylobacteriosis. Bovine liver can be contaminated with @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ on the surface and inside by the bile at slaughterhouses. Therefore, we investigated the current prevalence and characteristics of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in bovine bile at a slaughterhouse. @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ was isolated from 35.7% (55/154) of bile samples. C. jejuni and @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ were the two most frequent species. High antimicrobial resistant rates in C. jejuni were observed against tetracycline (63.0%) and ciprofloxacin (44.4%). Multi-locus sequence typing divided C. jejuni isolates (27 isolates) into 12 sequence types (STs) in which ST806 was the most frequent ST and accounted for 37.0%. All @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ were identified as C. fetus subsp. fetus which can cause systemic infections. High antimicrobial resistant rates in @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ were observed against ciprofloxacin (66.6%), @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ (58.3%) and tetracycline (33.3%). All the @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ isolates were divided into two STs, ST3 (16 isolates) and ST6 (8 isolates). Of the 16 ST3 isolates, 15 (93.8%) were resistant to both @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ and ciprofloxacin. Our data shows high prevalence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in bovine bile and their high rates of antimicrobial resistance.	4
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp. are a leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, accounting for approximately 166 million illnesses and 37,600 deaths per year. Human infections with Campylobacter jejuni, the major pathogenic species of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, may develop severe abdominal cramps, watery or bloody diarrhea, and, in some cases, induce Guillain-Barre syndrome, an acute flaccid paralysis. Because C. jejuni is a commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry, human campylobacteriosis is caused most frequently by the consumption of contaminated poultry. C. jejuni requires low @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ concentrations, such as 3-15%, for growth, but is sensitive to @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ concentrations in normal aerobic conditions.	3
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ strains used as a source for chromosomal DNA were Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae (grown on Blood Heart Infusion (BHI) supplemented with 5% horse blood under anaerobic conditions) and C. jejuni 11168 (grown on MH under microaerophilic conditions). The antibiotics ampicillin (100 mug/mL), @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ (25 mug/mL) and kanamycin (25 mug/mL) were added to the growth medium when needed for selection.	3
@gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ is an excellent model organism to study respiration diversity, including anaerobic respiration of physiologically relevant N-/S-oxides compounds, such as biotin sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, @sm$ methionine sulfoxide @/sm$ (MetO), nicotinamide N-oxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. All @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains harbor at least two, often three, and up to five genes encoding for putative periplasmic Mo/W-bisPGD-containing N-/S-oxide reductases.	2
@gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ toxin B (CTX-B) was purchased from Calbiochem Billerica, MA. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. @sm$ FITC @/sm$ labeled anti-CD56 antibody was purchased from BioLegend, San Diego, CA.The ELISA kits were from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN and BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA.	0
@gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$, a mesophilic anaerobe isolated from forest soil, is an ideal microbe to study the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol. It grows on both of the two main components of plant biomass, cellulose and hemicellulose, by secreting enzymes to cleave these polysaccharides and then fermenting the resulting hexose (glucose, @sm$ galactose @/sm$, mannose) and pentose (xylose, arabinose) sugars to ethanol. Among clostridial genomes sequenced to date, @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ has the highest number of genes encoding enzymes for the modification and breakdown of complex carbohydrates. It contains genes for 161 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), which include 108 glycoside hydrolases spread across 39 families. This abundance of hydrolases highlights how cellulosic biomass is a complex substrate whose degradation likely requires the concerted action of many enzymes. Cellulolytic clostridia usually have numerous genes encoding family 9 glycoside hydrolases (GH9): the Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 genome has 16 GH9 genes, Clostridium cellulolyticum H10 has 13 GH9 genes, and Clostridium cellulovorans has five GH9 genes. In contrast, @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ has only a single GH9-encoding gene, cphy3367.	2
@gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ has been reported to take the acrylate pathway for propionate production, in which lactate is consumed. To provide lactate for @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, we supplied the consortium with Lactobacillus plantarum, a lactic acid bacterium, producing lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ that can support the acrylate pathway.	2
@gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ was one major species that showed an overall significant increased abundance in correlation with treatment only. Our previous study did not specifically identify @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ as increased by the treatment or subsequent period of dairy consumption; however, an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) identified at the time at the family level only (Lachnospiraceae_2) was increased in response to GOS and dairy consumption. The genus @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ (family Lachnospiraceae, phylum Firmicutes) contains three species (C. eutactus, @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ and C. comes), which are not phylogenetically closely related. @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ produces butyrate and propionate, while C. eutactus and C. comes produce butyrate with formate or @sm$ lactate @/sm$, respectively. @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ uses @sm$ lactate @/sm$ to generate propionate via the acrylate pathway.	2
@gm$ E. coli @/gm$ showed its highest susceptibility to imipenem (100%), and the bacterium showed lower susceptibility to aztreonam (97.9%), amikacin (97.7%), @sm$ cefepime @/sm$ (97.7%), and ceftriaxone (97.1%).	3
@gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ strains were inoculated from single colonies into 10 mL of BHI liquid medium and grown for 48-72 hr at 37 C to provide turbid starter cultures. These were diluted 1:100 in triplicate into 5 mL of basal medium containing 10 mM acetate and either 1 mM dopamine (in water) or vehicle (water). If applicable. molybdate (0.5 mM), tungstate (0.5 mM), DMSO (14 mM), or @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ (1 mM) were added at the time of inoculation.	2
@gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ was detected at high levels in F1 and F2 (8.9 +- 0.2 and 7.8 +- 0.4 log copies ml-1, respectively) in reactors 22 h after spiking (Table 2 and Fig. 6c). When pooling data from the two fermentations, @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ and @sm$ lactate @/sm$ supplementation led to significant increases in @sm$ lactate @/sm$ (P < 0.01), formate (P < 0.05), propionate (P < 0.001), and total SCFAs (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5c). The impact of daily addition of @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ at 108 CFU ml-1 together with 60 mM dl-lactate differed between fermentations (Fig. S7c and d). @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ and @sm$ lactate @/sm$ supplementation significantly increased butyrate (30.3 +- 1.3 mM versus 18.7 +- 1.2 mM, P < 0.01) in F1 and propionate (20.6 +- 2.5 mM versus 11.2 +- 2.9, P < 0.05) in F2 compared to respective stabilization. This treatment also decreased Enterobacteriaceae detected by qPCR in F1 (P < 0.05) (Table 2), which was confirmed by MiSeq data in both fermentations. A lower abundance of Enterococcus was also observed in both fermentations, with a higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Ruminococcus during F1 and of Collinsella and @sm$ lactate @/sm$-utilizing Veillonella during F2 and a lower Bacteroides abundance during F2 (Fig.	2
@gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ strains were isolated at prefectural livestock hygiene centers or meat inspection centers in 10 prefectures located either in Tohoku, Kanto, Hokuriku, Tokai, Chubu, Chugoku, Shikoku or Kyushu region of Japan during 2014 and 2016 from pigs affected with erysipelas. They were sent to the National Institute of Animal Health for serological and genetic analyses. In this study, only the @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ isolates from pigs affected with chronic erysipelas, namely, endocarditis and polyarthritis, in farms where the Koganei vaccine were used were analyzed for their serovars and @sm$ acriflavine @/sm$-resistance, and tested by the SNP-based PCR.	4
@gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ and related strains were grown in BBL Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) media (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) supplemented with L-arginine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) under an atmosphere of 2-5% @sm$ H2 @/sm$, 2-5% CO2, and balance N2.	2
@gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ can cause erysipelas in animals and erysipeloid in humans. Since its recurrence in 2012, swine erysipelas has caused serious losses within the pig industry in China. The aim of this study was to perform multilocus sequence typing and understand the virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ isolates in China. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of a total of 120 strains was performed, and as a result, three different sequence types were identified, of which ST48 was the main one. Five isolates of each MLST type were randomly selected to be used to challenge mice. ST48 was associated with a higher virulence. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using a microdilution technique and, to analyze the resistance mechanism, six strains were selected for genome sequencing. A comparison of the six genomes indicated the presence of a suspected macrolide resistance gene, namely, Erm(A)-like, in erythromycin-resistant strains, which increased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of erythromycin against E. coli C600 at least four-fold. In addition, three mutations (gyrA86T-I, gyrA90D-N, and parC81S-I) were observed in the @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC in @sm$ quinolone @/sm$-resistant strains. After the gyrA gene with the 86T-I mutation or the parC gene with the 81S-I mutation was transfected into E. coli C600, the MIC of enrofloxacin against this strain increased at least two-fold. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for developing antibacterial drugs and may contribute to the clinical prevention and control of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$.	4
"@gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$ is an important pathogen of humans, capable of causing severe diarrhea and more serious sequelae. In this study, the transcriptome response of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ to bile was determined. Bile exposure induced significant changes in mRNA levels of genes related to virulence potential, including a reduction of mRNA for the 41 genes making up the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Bile treatment had an unusual effect on mRNA levels for the entire flagella-chemotaxis regulon, resulting in two- to four-fold increases in mRNA levels for genes associated with the flagella hook-basal body structure, but a two-fold decrease for ""late"" flagella genes associated with the flagella filament, stator motor, and chemotaxis. Bile salts also caused increased mRNA levels for seventeen genes associated with iron scavenging and metabolism, and counteracted the inhibitory effect of the iron chelating agent @sm$ 2,2'-dipyridyl @/sm$ on growth of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$. These findings suggest that @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ may use bile as an environmental signal to adapt to changing conditions associated with the small intestine, including adaptation to an iron-scarce environment."	3
@gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$ can use the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway for demethylation of phenolic compounds (Genthner et al.; Drake; Liu and Suflita). This pathway was thus suggested as the most likely metabolism for IX conversion (Fig. 1b) (Drake; Studenik et al.; Jeong et al.). For methylotrophic reactions in @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$, inducible enzymes and complex patterns of diauxic growth and (co-) metabolic regulations have been described (Pacaud et al.; Lindley et al.; Cocaign et al.; Loubiere and Lindley; Loubiere et al.; Lebloas et al.). Whereas during growth on sugars, the WL pathway can be used to maintain the redox balance but there is no need that the pathway is coupled to energy conservation (Fig. 1c), in absence of sugars, the pathway must be coupled to net @sm$ ATP @/sm$ synthesis such as via ion gradient-driven phosphorylation by ATP synthases (Muller).	2
@gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$ is one of the key colonic bacteria implicated in the biotransformation of the polyphewnolic compounds @sm$ quercetin @/sm$, apigenin and naringenin.	2
@gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ (ATCC 25,586) was purchased from Guangdong Microbial Culture Collection Center (GDMCC), and grown in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (hopebio, China) supplemented with hemin, K2HPO4, Vitamin K1, and @sm$ L-Cysteine @/sm$ in a round bottom vertical anaerobic culture bag (hopebio, China) at 37 C.	2
@gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ was the paramount short chain fatty acid-producing bacterium in the human hindgut, also beneficial in improving diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, which further explained the improvement of intestinal barriers and the increased concentration of volatile fatty acids (propionic acid and @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$) in the cecum.	1
"@gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ is abundant in the healthy human intestinal microbiota, and the absence or scarcity of this bacterium has been linked with inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ thus shows promise as a next-generation probiotic for use in restoring the balance of the gut microbial flora and, due to its strong anti-inflammatory properties, for the treatment of certain pathological conditions. However, very little information is available about gene function and regulation in this species. Here, we utilized a systems biology approach-weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)-to analyze gene expression in three publicly available RNAseq datasets from F. prausnitzii strain A2-165, all obtained in different laboratory conditions. The co-expression network was then subdivided into 24 co-expression gene modules. A subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that these modules are associated with different kinds of biological processes, such as arginine, histidine, cobalamin, or @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ metabolism as well as bacteriophage function, molecular chaperones, stress response, or SOS response. Some genes appeared to be associated with mechanisms of protection against oxidative stress and could be essential for @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$'s adaptation and survival under anaerobic laboratory conditions. Hub and bottleneck genes were identified by analyses of intramodular connectivity and betweenness, respectively; this highlighted the high connectivity of genes located on mobile genetic elements, which could promote the genetic evolution of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ within its ecological niche. This study provides the first exploration of the complex regulatory networks in @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$, and all of the ""omics"" data are available online for exploration through a graphical interface at https://shiny.migale.inrae.fr/app/faeprau."	2
@gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ is recognized as a diverse taxon, both phenotypically and genotypically. Eight biotypes of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ have been identified by Piot et al. based on the presence of beta-galactosidase, lipase and hippurate hydrolysis activities, whereas Benito et al. identified seventeen biotypes based on these characteristics in addition to fermentation of xylose, @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ and galactose. Phenotypic diversity within @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ has also been described in terms of virulence factors, particularly production of sialidase and formation of biofilms. Genetic heterogeneity within @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ has been demonstrated using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Santiago et al., identified three ARDRA genotypes of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, of which only two genotypes (genotypes 1 and 3) produced sialidase.	2
@gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ is susceptible to various antibiotics: penicillin, amoxicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole and clindamycin. @sm$ Quinolones @/sm$ and co-trimoxazole are less effective. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for vaginosis. No consensus exists on the treatment of systemic infections. Among the five patients treated for bone-and-joint infections, three received amoxicillin or ampicillin, one patient each was prescribed clindamycin or co-trimoxazole, and rifampin or @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ were added to three patients' regimens.	3
@gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ KCTC5096 (@gm$ GV @/gm$) and Atopobium vaginae KCTC15240 (AV) were obtained from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (Daejun, Korea). The bacteria were subcultured in GAM or BHI broth supplemented with yeast extract (1%), @sm$ maltose @/sm$ (0.1%), glucose (0.1%), and horse serum (10%) at 37  C for 48 h under anaerobic conditions (in a sealed anaerobic jar).	2
@gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (n = 25, 67.6%), amoxicillin (n = 18, 34%), cefuroxime (n = 5, 25%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (n = 4, 22.2%), tetracycline (n = 4, 14.8%), chloramphenicol (n = 6, 10.9%), and ceftriaxone (n = 5, 9.6%). All @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ isolates were sensitive to @sm$ penicillin G @/sm$ and ciprofloxacin (Table 5).	3
@gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ and Haemophilus influenzae, upper respiratory tract microbiota representatives, are able to colonize natural and artificial surfaces as biofilm. The aim of the present study was to assay the effect of ten 1,2,4-triazole-ciprofloxacin hybrids on planktonic or biofilm-forming haemophili cells in vitro under stationary conditions on the basis of MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and MBICs (minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations). In addition, anti-adhesive properties of these compounds were examined. The reference strains of @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ and H. influenzae were included. The broth microdilution microtiter plate (MTP) method with twofold dilution of the compounds, or ciprofloxacin (reference agent) in 96-well polystyrene microplates, was used. The optical density (OD) reading was made spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 570 nm (OD570) both to measure bacterial growth and to detect biofilm-forming cells under the same conditions with 0.1% @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$.	3
@gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ was 100% resistance to ampicillin, 85.7% in chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole trimethoprim and cephalothin, (71%) in ceftriaxone however it indicates low resistance to ciprofloxacin (35.7%) and doxycycline. This was in consistence with the study done in Ethiopia. Proteus species were resistance to ampicillin (91%), cephalothin (87%), @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (73.9%) and ceftriaxone (65%). The isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (83%) and gentamicin (74%). This was compared to previous studies done in the country and elsewhere. Most of the gram negative bacteria isolated were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ and chloramphenicol.	4
@gm$ Klebsiella aerogenes @/gm$ strain W70 has an inducible pathway for the degradation of d-arabitol which is comparable to the one found in Aerobacter aerogenes strain PRL-R3. The pathway is also similar to the pathway of ribitol catabolism in that it is composed of a pentitol dehydrogenase, d-arabitol dehydrogenase (ADH), and a pentulokinase, d-xylulokinase (DXK). These two enzymes are coordinately controlled and induced in response to d-arabitol, the apparent inducer of synthesis of these enzymes. We obtained mutants which lacked a functional d-xylose pathway and were constitutive for the ribitol catabolic pathway. These mutants were able to grow on the unusual pentitol, xylitol, only if they contained the functional DXK of the d-arabitol pathway. This provided us with a specific selection technique for DXK(+) transductants. As in @gm$ A. aerogenes @/gm$, mutants constitutive for ADH were able to use this enzyme to convert the hexitol @sm$ d-mannitol @/sm$ to d-fructose. With mutants blocked in the normal @sm$ d-mannitol @/sm$ catabolic pathway, growth on @sm$ d-mannitol @/sm$ became a test for ADH constitutivity. Growth of such mutants on xylitol, d-arabitol, and @sm$ d-mannitol @/sm$ was utilized to classify transductants in mapping, by transductional analysis, the loci involved in d-arabitol utilization.	2
@gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ strains can be isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract, blood and cerebrospinal fluid of infants, and they are affiliated with upper-respiratory diseases in adults. In this study, we isolated K. michiganensis strains predominantly from sewage sludge. Previously, it was shown that sub-group B1 strains have the potential to synthesize protease inhibitor @sm$ leupeptin @/sm$, which might provide a colonization advantage in the lung.	1
@gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ is considered a good host strain for the production of 2,3-butanediol, which is a promising platform chemical with various industrial applications. In this study, three genes, including those encoding glucosyltransferase (wabG), lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), and pyruvate formate-lyase (pflB), were disrupted in @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ to reduce both its pathogenic characteristics and the production of several by-products. In flask cultivation with minimal medium, the yield of 2,3-butanediol from rationally engineered @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ (DeltawabG DeltaldhA DeltapflB) reached 0.461 g/g @sm$ glucose @/sm$, which was 92.2% of the theoretical maximum, with a significant reduction in by-product formation. However, the growth rate of the pflB mutant was slightly reduced compared to that of its parental strain. Comparison with similar mutants of Escherichia coli suggested that the growth defect of pflB-deficient @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ was caused by redox imbalance rather than reduced level of intracellular acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). From an analysis of the transcriptome, it was confirmed that the removal of pflB from @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ significantly repressed the expression of genes involved in the formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) system.	2
@gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ strain JNQH579 was recovered from a sputum sample of a 64-year male patient in intensive care units (ICUs) at a tertiary hospital in Jinan City, Shandong Province, in March 2021, who had been hospitalized for 17days due to severe pneumoniae and renal failure. The patient had received @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$ treatment for 7days at a dosage of 100mg (IV) q12h before the isolation of the strain. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility testing results, antibiotic therapy was switched to aztreonam 0.5g (IV) q8h in combination with @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$.	4
@gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ strains are capable of fermenting alpha-galactosides including raffinose and melibiose and the resulting alpha-galactose is further degraded through either the tagatose 6-phosphate or the Leloir pathway (Boucher et al., ). L. hircilactis acidifies milk well and is capable of fermenting @sm$ galactose @/sm$, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, sucrose, mannitol, gentibiose and starch, whereas L. laudensis exhibits limited milk acidification yet is able to ferment lactose, @sm$ galactose @/sm$, sucrose, mannitol and xylose (Meucci et al., ).	2
@gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ strains are capable of fermenting alpha-galactosides including raffinose and melibiose and the resulting alpha-galactose is further degraded through either the tagatose 6-phosphate or the Leloir pathway (Boucher et al., ). L. hircilactis acidifies milk well and is capable of fermenting galactose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, sucrose, @sm$ mannitol @/sm$, gentibiose and starch, whereas L. laudensis exhibits limited milk acidification yet is able to ferment lactose, galactose, sucrose, @sm$ mannitol @/sm$ and xylose (Meucci et al., ).	2
@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ is able to convert tryptophan into @sm$ indole @/sm$ and its derivatives, which are major aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs) that play a pivotal role in intestinal immunobarrier function.	1
@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ strains grown in MRS media (with or without antibiotics), washed with @sm$ PBS @/sm$ and re-suspended in @sm$ PBS @/sm$ were orally gavaged once/day for 7 consecutive days before starting the DSS treatment. Oral gavage of indicated lactobacilli was continued daily until experiments were terminated (11 days, 16 days). Lactobacilli were administered at varying cell number. Regular dose consisted of 109 CFU/mouse/day (denoted as 1 x ), high dose consisted of 1010 CFU/mouse/day (denoted as 10 x ) and low dose consisted of 108 CFU/mouse/day (denoted as 0.1 x ) (See Fig. S2). Control mice (untreated, DSS only) received daily gavage of @sm$ PBS @/sm$ instead of bacteria.	3
@gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ is one of the widespread probiotic bacteria that can overcome acid and bile barrier of stomach and intestine, respectively, and then have beneficial effects on the host improving its intestinal microbial balance. The cell membrane FO F1 -ATPase is an important factor in the response and tolerance to low pH through the action of controlling the H+ concentration between the cell cytoplasm and external medium. In this study, the effects of extremely high-frequency EMI at the frequencies of 51 8 GHz and 53 GHz and cetfazidime ( mumol l-1 ) on survival of L. acidophilus VKM B-1660 in the gastrointestinal model in vitro and on ATPase activity of their membrane vesicles were investigated. Irradiated @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ survived in media with acid pH; the irradiation stimulated N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive FO F1 -ATPase activity under acidic conditions, but enhanced the inhibitory effects of @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$. Probably irradiated @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ is overcoming the acid barrier even in the presence of @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ due to the FO F1 -ATPase. The obtained results can allow the use of @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ in food industry, veterinary and medicine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The probiotic property of lactobacilli is defined with survival in different conditions of human digestive tract even in the presence of antibiotics and subjected to electromagnetic irradiation (EMI) at the extremely high frequency. Despite the fact that EMI and antibiotic @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ affected @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$; the viable number of bacterial cells was decreased in in vitro gastrointestinal model, but they could to grow in fresh growth medium. The changes in the FO F1 -ATPase activity were obtained at acidic pH. Thus, these bacteria can overcome acid barrier due to the FO F1 -ATPase: the irradiation stimulates the FO F1 -ATPase activity in the acidic conditions, but enhances the effects of @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$.	3
@gm$ Lactobacillus crispatus @/gm$ strains were cultivated on semisynthetic MRS medium without glucose supplemented with a 1% (wt/vol) concentration of a particular sugar, and the optical densities (measured at a wavelength of 600 nm) were recorded using a plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Tested sugars are arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, fucose, galactose, @sm$ glycogen @/sm$, glucose, inulin, maltodextrin, mannitol, N-acetil-D-glucosamine, N-acetil-D-galactosamine, mannose, melibiose, maltose, raffinose, rhamnose, ribose, sorbitol, starch, sucrose, threalose, turanose, and xylose (Figure 3).	2
@gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ and Lactobacillus paragasseri are human commensal lactobacilli that are candidates for probiotic application. Knowledge of their oligosaccharide metabolic properties is valuable for synbiotic application. The present study characterized oligosaccharide metabolic systems and their impact on @sm$ lipoteichoic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ LTA @/sm$) production in the two organisms, i.e., L. gasseri JCM 1131T and L. paragasseri JCM 11657. The two strains grew well in medium with glucose but poorly in medium with raffinose, and growth rates in medium with kestose differed between the strains. Oligosaccharide metabolism markedly influenced their @sm$ LTA @/sm$ production, and apparent molecular size of @sm$ LTA @/sm$ in electrophoresis recovered from cells cultured with glucose and kestose differed from that from cells cultured with raffinose in the strains. On the other hand, more than 15-fold more @sm$ LTA @/sm$ was observed in the @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ cells cultured with raffinose when compared with glucose or kestose after incubation for 15 h. Transcriptome analysis identified glycoside hydrolase family 32 enzyme as a potential kestose hydrolysis enzyme in the two strains. Transcriptomic levels of multiple genes in the dlt operon, involved in D-alanine substitution of @sm$ LTA @/sm$, were lower in cells cultured with raffinose than in those cultured with kestose or glucose. This suggested that the different sizes of @sm$ LTA @/sm$ observed among the carbohydrates tested were partly due to different levels of alanylation of @sm$ LTA @/sm$. The present study indicates that available oligosaccharide has the impact on the @sm$ LTA @/sm$ production of the industrially important lactobacilli, which might influence their probiotic properties.	1
@gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ produce a glycolipid-type biosurfactant closely resembling xylolipids. The biosurfactants produced by Lactococcus lactis 53 are composed of glycoproteins with @sm$ glucose @/sm$, rhamnose, fucose and mannose.	1
@gm$ Lactobacillus johnsonii @/gm$ BS15 (CCTCC M2013663) is a probiotic strain that was first isolated from homemade yogurt collected from Hongyuan Prairie, Aba Autonomous Prefecture, China and reported to prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases in obese mice. In our previous study, we found that incorporating BS15 to broiler diet enhanced growth performance and improved meat quality. Moreover, only live BS15 and not disrupted cells may exert health benefits mainly by improving @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism, intestinal development, and gut microflora in the small intestine. We then applied BS15 to prevent SNE and discovered that it may positively control the growth performance, @sm$ lipid @/sm$ deposition, and fatty acid composition of chicken meat during SNE infection by enhancing intestinal development and balancing microflora in the intestines.	1
@gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, unlike most lactococci, is able to ferment alpha-galactosides, such as melibiose and @sm$ raffinose @/sm$. More than 12 kb of chromosomal DNA from L. raffinolactis ATCC 43920 was sequenced, including the alpha-galactosidase gene and genes involved in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. These genes are organized into an operon containing aga (alpha-galactosidase), galK (galactokinase), and galT (galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase). Northern blotting experiments revealed that this operon was induced by galactosides, such as lactose, melibiose, @sm$ raffinose @/sm$, and, to a lesser extent, galactose. Similarly, alpha-galactosidase activity was higher in lactose-, melibiose-, and @sm$ raffinose @/sm$-grown cells than in galactose-grown cells. No alpha-galactosidase activity was detected in glucose-grown cells. The expression of the aga-galKT operon was modulated by a regulator encoded by the upstream gene galR. The product of galR belongs to the LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators. In L. lactis, @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ GalR acted as a repressor of aga and lowered the enzyme activity by more than 20-fold.	2
@gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$ infection of mammalian cells was described previously. To examine @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ containing vacuole (LCV) localization of endogenous plasma membrane t-SNARE molecules in RAW 264.7 macrophages, cells were infected with dsRed-expressing wild-type @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ or dotA mutant at an MOI of one for 1 h. Cells were fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol, and blocked with 2% BSA in @sm$ PBS @/sm$. Samples were stained with antibodies to Stx2, Stx3, Stx4 or SNAP23 and Alexa-488-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). To examine LCV localization of endogenous Sec22b and VAMP7 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, cells were infected as described earlier. After infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in @sm$ PBS @/sm$ for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were stained with rabbit or mouse anti-@gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ antibodies to detect the extracellular bacteria before permeabilization. After staining extracellular bacteria, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, blocked and stained with antibodies to Sec22b or VAMP7, and Alexa-488 anti-rabbit or mouse IgG secondary Abs to detect Sec22b or VAMP7, and Alexa-350 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies to identify the extracellular bacteria. To examine endogenous plasma membrane t-SNARE molecules and Sec22b in HEK293-FcgammaRII cells and 3x-FLAG-Sec22b and 3x-FLAG VAMP7 in HEK293-FcgammaRII stable cell lines, @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ was opsonized with rabbit or mouse anti-@gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ antibodies (1:1000), and cells were infected at an MOI of one for 1 h.	0
@gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ (@gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$) is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes infections in humans. In this study, the effects of @sm$ tea tree oil @/sm$ (@sm$ TTO @/sm$) at subinhibitory concentrations on @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ growth and two important exotoxin proteins secreted by @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ were researched. Treatment with half of minimal inhibitory concentration of @sm$ TTO @/sm$ demonstrated very little or no reduction in numbers of viable ATCC 19115 cells. Listeriolysin O (LLO) and p60, were investigated. A listeriolysin assay was used to investigate the hemolytic activities of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ exposed to @sm$ TTO @/sm$, and the secretion of LLO and p60 was detected by immunoblot analysis. Additionally, real-time RT-PCR was used to analyse the influence of @sm$ TTO @/sm$ on the transcription of LLO and p60 encoded genes hly and iap respectively. According to our experimental results, we propose that @sm$ TTO @/sm$ could be used as a promising natural compound against @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ and its virulence factors. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report on the influence of subinhibitory concentrations of @sm$ tea tree oil @/sm$ (@sm$ TTO @/sm$) on the secretion of listeriolysin O (LLO) and p60, the critical virulence factors involved in Listeria pathogenesis. The results showed that @sm$ TTO @/sm$ at 0 25 mg ml-1 reduced the secretion of LLO and p60 to 10 and 34 9% respectively, in addtion, the transcription of hly and iap was reduced to 10 and 4 3% at 0 5 mg ml-1 respectively. We propose that @sm$ TTO @/sm$ could be used as a promising antimicrobial compound and virulence inhibitor against @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$.	3
@gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ can be carried by and infect poultry, although the clinical disease in birds is rare. Escape from macrophage phagocytosis is a key step in pathogenesis for @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$. Therefore, we investigated the infection of the chicken macrophage-like cell line HD11 with 2 strains of L. monocytogenes EGD-e and Scott A. After infection, @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ was quantified by spread plating and HD11 was quantified with trypan blue exclusion stain before enumeration. The standard macrophage killing protocols require washing the cell monolayers 3 times with @sm$ PBS @/sm$, which was found to negatively influence HD11 monolayers. Maximum bacterial densities within macrophages were not different between the 2 Listeria strains. HD11 required more than 11 h to effectively reduce intracellular @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ Scott A, and Scott A was more susceptible to HD11 killing than EGD-e. It appears that Listeria infection initially causes attenuation of HD11 growth, and infected HD11 cells do not begin to lyse until at least 11 h post infection. These results suggest that there are subtle strain to strain differences in response to HD11 macrophage phagocytosis. The long lead-time required for HD11 to kill @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ cells means that there is sufficient time available for chicken macrophages to circulate in the blood and transfer the intracellular Listeria to multiple tissues.	0
@gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9-broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80, and 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment, or on 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% @sm$ oleic acid @/sm$-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment. Cultures were supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate. For fractionation of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ cultures, they were grown in Sauton's defined medium (Teknova).	2
@gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ transformed with pSMT3-lipY-mspA was cultured in 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% ADS and 0.05% @sm$ Tween-80 @/sm$.	2
@gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ spp. are methane producers, and our Spearman's rank correlation data shows positive associations between @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ and methane metabolism (rho = 0.88, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4b). Other significant positive correlations (rho >= 0.5, p < 0.01) include pathways involved in transcription and translation, secondary metabolite synthesis, and @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism.	1
"@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" based on annotation of the genomes we recently sequenced is shown in Figure 2; a similar pathway is inferred from the M. luminyensis genome. As for other methanogenic archaea, it includes a methyltransferase MttB with a predicted pyrrolysine residue, which is associated with its synthetic machinery. The fact that these strains were isolated from humans might facilitate regulatory compliance. M. luminyensis like M. smithii is susceptible to @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$, metronidazole, ordinazole and squalamine, providing the reassurance of contingency eradication."	3
"@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" has a circular genome of 1,931,561 bp, with a G+C content of 41.3%. Despite its close phylogenetic relationship with M. luminyensis, the genome of ""Ca. @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" is 27% smaller and its G+C content is 20% lower than that of M. luminyensis. This suggests a fast genomic reshuffle in one of the two genomes, which may be due to differential adaptation to the gut environment. The ""Ca. @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" genome contains 46 tRNA genes, a single copy of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes, and 2 noncontiguous copies of 5S rRNA genes that were distant from the 23S and 16S rRNA genes. A total of 1,820 protein-coding sequences were predicted. A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) region containing 110 spacers was identified using CRISPRfinder, in close association with cas genes. The genome of ""Ca. @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" contains one mcr operon (mcrBDGA) and a mcrC gene distantly located from it. Genes involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis from methanol (mtaABC) and @sm$ methylamine @/sm$ compounds (mtmBC, mtbBC, and mttBC) are also present. The latter are on an 18.7-kb region also containing the genes involved in pyrrolysine biosynthesis. The sequence of ""Ca. @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" offers a great opportunity to determine the metabolic properties and phenotypic features of this poorly characterized order of methanogens related to Thermoplasmatales, and it will further help to identify the genomic adaptations of methanogens to gut environments."	2
@gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$, one type of NTM, grew in the cultures of this tissue. She was initially treated with kanamycin and ethionamide but eventually underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. The postoperative course was marked by transient hypoparathyroidism. Two years after her surgery, her serum thyroxine, calcium, and @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ levels normalized.	0
@gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$ is one of the most pathogenic and frequent nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated from humans. Patients with adverse drug reactions, resistant isolates, or suboptimal response require alternative treatment regimens. One hundred forty-eight consecutive clinical isolates of @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ were tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities by the BACTEC 460 system (NCCLS) with two different inoculation protocols, one conventional and one alternative. In the alternative protocol, the inoculum 12B vial was incubated until the growth index was between 250 and 500. Four conventional antimycobacterial drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol) were studied with standard critical concentrations. The in vitro activities of linezolid, telithromycin, clarithromycin, @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$, and moxifloxacin were determined by measuring radiometric MICs. All isolates tested were identified as @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ genotype I and were resistant to isoniazid at a concentration of 0.4 mug/ml. One hundred twenty isolates (81.1%) were inhibited by 1 microg of isoniazid per ml. A high level of resistance to isoniazid (>10 microg/ml) was observed in six isolates (4.1%). Only five strains (3.4%) were resistant to rifampin (>1 microg/ml). All isolates studied were susceptible to streptomycin and ethambutol. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (in micrograms per milliliter) were as follows: linezolid, 1 (range, < or =0.25 to 2); telithromycin, >16 (range, 4 to >16); clarithromycin, 0.5 (range, < or =0.03 to 1); @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$, 0.12 (range, 0.12 to 0.25); and moxifloxacin, 0.06 (range, < or =0.06 to 0.12). The susceptibility testing results with both inoculation protocols showed perfect correlation. In conclusion, all @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ isolates showed decreased susceptibility to isoniazid, but resistance to rifampin was infrequent.	3
@gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$, a close genetic relative of M. tuberculosis, possesses several advantages as a suitable model for tuberculosis drug screening. However, despite the high genetic similarity, there are some obvious differences in susceptibility to some tuberculosis drugs between these two species, especially for the prodrugs ethionamide and @sm$ isoniazid @/sm$. In this study, we aimed to improve @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ as a model for antituberculosis drug identification by heterologous expression of two common drug activators, EthA and KatG. These two activators were overexpressed in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$, and the strains were tested against ethionamide, @sm$ isoniazid @/sm$, and a library of established antimycobacterial compounds from TB Alliance to compare drug susceptibility. Both in vitro and in vivo using zebrafish larvae, these genetically modified @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ strains showed significantly higher susceptibility against ethionamide and @sm$ isoniazid @/sm$, which require activation by EthA and KatG. More importantly, a strain overexpressing both ethA and katG was potentially more susceptible to approximately 20% of the antituberculosis hit compounds from the TB Alliance library. Most of these compounds were activated by EthA in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ Four of these compounds were selected for further analysis, and three of them showed obvious EthA-dependent activity against M. tuberculosis Overall, our developed @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ strains are valuable tools for high-throughput discovery of potential novel antituberculosis prodrugs.	3
@gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$, on the other hand, has been shown to be crucial for maintaining a healthy gut, and decreased abundance is associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cystic fibrosis. Specific species of @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$, such as @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ and O. laneus, have been found to improve @sm$ glucose @/sm$ tolerance and reduce inflammation by producing outer membrane vesicles and reducing intestinal succinate.	2
@gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (ORT) is an emerging respiratory pathogen of poultry in North America that is causing millions of dollars in economic losses to the poultry industry. @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ is associated with airsacculitis, pleuritis, pneumonia, and consolidation of lungs. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of infection. In this study, the mechanism of iron acquisition by @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ was explored. @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ strains grown under iron deprivation in media containing 200 microM @sm$ 2,2'-dipyridyl @/sm$ did not secrete siderophores as measured by the chrome azurol S (CAS) agar and CAS solution assays. Filter disks impregnated with various protein-bound iron compounds and inorganic iron salts of Fe(III) and Fe(II) placed on iron-restricted agar inoculated with a lawn of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ supported growth from sheep and porcine hemoglobins, ovotransferrin, Fe(III), and Fe(II), but they did not support growth from bovine transferrin, bovine apo-transferrin, bovine lactoferrin, and hemin. However, both bovine hemoglobin and transferrin supported growth of O. rhinotracheale serotype C. Four immunoreactive proteins involved in iron acquisition were identified in an @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ membrane extract by using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ field strains showed differential sensitivity to @sm$ 2,2'-dipyridyl @/sm$. Of the 72 field strains tested, 22 strains were resistant to the iron chelator at concentrations of 50 microM and 100 microM, suggesting this attribute may be related to disease-producing potential of these strains. This is the first report on the identification of the iron acquisition mechanism of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$.	2
@gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ (ASVs 003 and 018), Colidextribacter (ASV 009), and Sporanaerobacter (ASV 025) are genera often found to be abundant in communities producing MCCs (Joshi et al., ; Liu et al., ; Zagrodnik et al., ). Only few isolates of these genera have been characterized. @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, Colidextribacter massiliensis, and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes are heterotrophs that produce short-chain carboxylates via sugar fermentation (Hernandez-Eugenio, ; Katano et al., ; Ricaboni et al., ), with @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ being described additionally as an n-valerate producer. @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ isolates growing autotrophically on H2/@sm$ CO2 @/sm$ or CO and producing i-valerate have been reported (Park, Yasin, Kim, Park, et al., ; Park, Yasin, Kim, Roh, et al., ). Here, @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ and Colidextribacter correlated to n-caproate formation and not to gas consumption (Figure 4B), suggesting a heterotrophic chain elongation metabolism.	2
@gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic bacterium that commonly inhabits the human gut and degrades oxalate as its major energy and carbon source. A review of colonization frequencies conducted worldwide indicated that 38-77% of a normal population is colonized with @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$. Recent evidence suggests a lack of colonization with @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ may increase the risk for recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. Protection against calcium oxalate stone disease appears to be due to the oxalate degradation that occurs in the gut on low @sm$ calcium @/sm$ diets with a possible further contribution from intestinal oxalate secretion. Despite the role this organism may play in reducing oxalate levels in the host and reducing the risk of calcium oxalate stone disease, there is scant information on how this organism colonizes the host and adapts to new environments. The release of the genome sequence of a Group 1 (OxCC13) and a Group 2 strain (HOxBLS) as part of the Human Microbiome Project has provided a genetic framework for investigating important biological properties of the organism. In this study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics of both log and stationary growth phase cultures of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$. These proteomic analyses of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ cultures provide insight into the physiological response associated with nutrient shifts and entry into stationary phase growth.	2
@gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ was adjusted to a concentration to 2 x 107 CFU/ml using the plate count method, mixed with 5% LY-shelled MBs (8.4 x 106 bubbles/ml, containing 0.75 mg/ml LY) in an Eppendorf tube, and sonicated by the 1-MHz US transducer of the sonoporation system successively at the following acoustic power densities: 1 W/cm2 for 1 min, 2 W/cm2 for 1 min, and 3 W/cm2 for 1 min. The duty cycle was set at 50% and a 0.6-cm-diameter US transducer was used. The change in temperature during US sonication at power densities of 2 and 3 W/cm2 for 1 min at 37  C did not exceed 0.3  C, as measured by a thermometer (Optris LS, Optris, Berlin, Germany). The solution was rested for 30 min, and then samples were diluted 1:104 in @sm$ PBS @/sm$, and 10 muL of each sample was spotted on RCM agar plates. The samples were incubated at 37  C under anaerobic conditions for 3 days, and then the CFU of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ were quantified with the aid of image-analysis software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).	3
@gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ has been found to have high affinity for the GABA system and binding characteristics that are similar to those of brain receptors. Escherichia coli O157:H7 has a receptor for host-derived @sm$ epinephrine @/sm$/norepinephrine that can be selectively inhibited by adrenergic antagonists.	0
@gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ O17 @sm$ LPS @/sm$ was hydrolyzed with 2% acetic acid and the core oligosaccharide 1 was isolated by gel chromatography.	1
@gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ species are obligately anaerobic bacteria that degrade @sm$ saccharides @/sm$, forming acetate and succinate as major end products. These observations imply that bacteria assigned to vadinCA02 and Blvii28 decompose peptone and @sm$ saccharides @/sm$ into acetate, respectively, and the acetate thus produced may serve as a fuel for the generation of current for exoelectrogens.	2
@gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (@gm$ ATCC8503 @/gm$), which was cultured in brain-heart infusion medium (Huankai, China) at 37  C in an anaerobic chamber for 24 h. Bacterial pellets were collected by centrifuging at 8000xg for 10 min at 4  C. After resuspended in sterilized oxygen-free PBS, cultured bacterial cells were administrated orally to mouse at 0.2 mL containing 2 x 108 CFU. The experimental groups were set as follows (n = 6): (1) control; (2) A+TP; (3) antibiotics+TP+@gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ (A + TP + @sm$ Pd @/sm$.); (4) antibitoics + TP + heat-killed @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ (A + TP + @sm$ Pd @/sm$.-H). After antibiotics treatment for 7 days, A + TP, A + TP + @sm$ Pd @/sm$., and A + TP + @sm$ Pd @/sm$.-H groups were given @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ transplantation and TP treatment (0.1 mg/kg) daily for 14 days starting from the 8th day. Heat-killed @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ was treated parallelly.	0
@gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ and Weissella in fermented dough were positively correlated with short-chain aldehydes, while Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with them, suggesting that dough fermented by @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ or Weissella had more lipid-oxidation products than the dough fermented by Lactobacillus. Similar results were found by Xu et al., who showed that P. pentosaceus participated in the lipid oxidation of broccoli juice fermentation, affected the content of lipid degradation products including volatile aldehydes and alcohols, and enhanced the sensory properties of broccoli juice. Lipid oxidation in wheat flour and microbial metabolism are the main pathways for the formation of alcohols in fermented dough. In the lipid oxidation pathway, the alcohols are generated by lipoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ and conversion of lipid-oxidizing compounds such as aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols. @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ and Weissella in fermented dough were positively correlated with 1-hexanol (green), 1-nonanol (citrus), and 1-heptanol (green), but Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with them. It was indicated that the fermented doughs containing @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ and Weissella showed stronger lipid oxidation reactions, which provided more precursors for alcohol conversion and formed more alcohol flavor compounds than Lactobacillus in dough.	1
@gm$ Peptostreptococcus prevotii @/gm$, Corynebacterium species, and Eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while Gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other infections. beta-Lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci. Ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin, clindamycin and @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$ showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.	3
@gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ can grow only on @sm$ succinates @/sm$, whereas Viellonela parvula uses lactate as the main substrate; however, they can get additional energy from @sm$ succinates @/sm$.	2
@gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ consumes succinate to produce propionate. This may be the same as Phascolarctobacterium faecium, which lacks fumarate reductase required for succinate production, so it cannot produce succinate and needs to utilize succinate produced by other bacteria to complete its own metabolism. In addition, Clostridia spp. colonization can be promoted by treating drinking water with succinate in mice. This is probably because succinate can consume @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ to promote the colonization of strict anaerobes.	2
@gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ is a gram-negative pathogen which can utilize @sm$ heme @/sm$ as an iron source. In previous work, @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ genes which permitted @sm$ heme iron @/sm$ utilization in a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli were isolated. In the present study, the cloned @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ sequences were found to encode ten potential @sm$ heme @/sm$ utilization proteins: HugA, the putative heme receptor; TonB and ExbBD; HugB, the putative periplasmic binding protein; HugCD, the putative inner membrane permease; and the proteins HugW, HugX, and HugZ. Three of the genes, hugA, hugZ, and tonB, contain a Fur box in their putative promoters, indicating that the genes may be iron regulated. When the @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ genes were tested in E. coli K-12 or in a @sm$ heme iron @/sm$ utilization mutant of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$, hugA, the TonB system genes, and hugW, hugX, or hugZ were required for @sm$ heme iron @/sm$ utilization. When the genes were tested in a hemA entB mutant of E. coli, hugWXZ were not required for utilization of @sm$ heme @/sm$ as a porphyrin source, but their absence resulted in heme toxicity when the strains were grown in media containing @sm$ heme @/sm$ as an iron source. hugA could replace the Vibrio cholerae hutA in a @sm$ heme iron @/sm$ utilization assay, and V. cholerae hutA could complement a @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ @sm$ heme @/sm$ utilization mutant, suggesting that HugA is the heme receptor. Our analyses of the TonB system of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ indicated that it could function in tonB mutants of both E.	2
@gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. They are non-motile, singular cells that thrive in anaerobic growth conditions. They thrive on tissues with decreased oxidation-reduction potentials, such as those with limited blood supply or tissue necrosis. @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. are found in the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. They can act as an opportunistic pathogen, often penetrating tissues and establishing an infection at mucosal surfaces causing periodontal and tooth problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis. They predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. Some @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. are resistant to Beta-lactam antibiotics. Effective antibiotic treatments are metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ureidopenicilins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. This patient had extensive spread of the infection due to a late diagnosis of an abscess in the visceral space with a @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ resistant @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ treated with amoxicillin.	4
@gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is often associated with the degradation and utilization of starch, proteins, and @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ in the rumen; however, according to, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ may be involved in fiber degradation in the rumens of sheep. Furthermore, confirmed that @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ contributes to the degradation of the plant cell wall by acting synergistically with cellulolytic bacteria.	2
@gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species originate mostly from the oral cavity, are pigmented anaerobic Gram-negative rods and important pathogens in endodontic infections. Anaerobic bacteria are generally considered to be of relatively low virulence and are especially prevalent in infections associated with underlying conditions such as trauma or dental extraction, thus affording an opportunity to penetrate deeper tissues or blood stream and inaugurate infection. The @gm$ P. denticola @/gm$ strain cultured from the patient's blood was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxitin, but resistant to @sm$ penicillin @/sm$. The @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species are disseminated by hematogenous route and harbor the brain tissue to form abscess gradually although his blood was sterilized after antibiotic treatment with meropenem. If the diagnosis of @gm$ P. denticola @/gm$ can be obtained before dental extraction, antibiotic treatment may lead to complete resolution.	4
@gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ was cultured in BHI+S liquid media, minimal media plus a carbon source, on BHI agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood or on YT agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood and 5% sucrose unless otherwise specified. Cultures were routinely grown and manipulated in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) with an atmosphere of 20% CO2, 10% H2, and 70% N2 at 37 C. When necessary, antibiotics were added to the medium as follows: 7 microg/ml vancomycin, 100 microg/ml @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$, 200 microg/ml gentamicin, 20 microg/ml erythromycin for selecting P. copri DSM 18205 derived plasmid integrants; 5 microg/ml for other @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ strains, and 20 microg/ml tetracycline for RHA03 and HDE06; 2.5 microg/ml for HDD04, HDE04 and HDD05.	3
@gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$ shared 12.7% of the bacterial consortium producing hydrogen (Figure 9). This species is Gram-negative, obligately anaerobic, rod-shaped, and belongs to the phylum Bacteroides. It has previously been isolated during biohydrogen production. However, it was 0.3% of the community with methanogenic activity, similar to the observations of Mariakakis et al.. The end products of @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$ metabolism during sucrose fermentation are mainly succinic and acetic acids, while smaller quantities of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ can also be detected.	1
@gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$ plays a prominent role in the breakdown of peptides in the rumen, a process which contributes to excessive ammonia production and inefficient nitrogen retention in ruminants. Various metal ions and chelators were examined to assess how the metal ion-dependent dipeptidase activity of P. ruminicola M384 might be inhibited. Using sonicated extracts, Cu2+, Cr2+ and Hg2+ were most inhibitory, decreasing Ala2 breakdown to 15, 15 and 5% of control activity, whereas Co2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ stimulated activity by 189, 30 and 26%, respectively. The chelators, EDTA, EGTA, TPEN and @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$, were inhibitory, as were several phenanthroline analogues. Among the stereoisomers of @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ tested, derivatives methylated on C-2 and C-9 were less effective than the parent molecule, but 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (TMP) was more inhibitory. Titration of the most effective inhibitors showed that EDTA, TPEN and TMP had similar potency and were effective at 0.1 mmol l-1 and above. Thus some metal ions and chelators are potent inhibitors of @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ dipeptidase, although they are unlikely to be sufficiently specific to peptide metabolism to be useful in vivo.	3
@gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ strain GU was able to utilize guanidine, agmatine, and urea as sole sources of nitrogen for growth, using citrate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ as carbon sources (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).	2
@gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ was grown in specialized @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ (Rum) media (per 50 mL of 2x media): yeast extract (0.25 g), @sm$ NaHCO3 @/sm$ (0.4 g), L-cysteine (0.1 g), (NH4)2SO4 (0.09 g), K2HPO4 (0.045 g), KH2PO4 (0.045 g), NaCl (0.09 g), MgSO4 (0.004 g), CaCl2 (0.009 g), biotin (20 mug), cobalamin (20 mug), p-aminobenzoic acid (60 mug), folic acid (100 mug), pyridoxamine (300 mug), thiamine (100 mug), riboflavin (100 mug), D-pantothenoic acid hemicalcium salt (100 mug), nicotinamide (100 mug), and resazurin (50 mug). Rum media also contained (concentrations per 50 mL of 2x media): hematin (30 muM), L-histidine (3 mM), acetic acid (63.7 mM), propionic acid (17.8 mM), isobutyric acid (5.75 mM), isovaleric acid (1.95 mM), and valeric acid (1.95 mM). Rum media was diluted with an equal volume of a carbohydrate source (0.05% w/v maltose or fructose and glycogen) to culture cells. Co-cultures were made by growing @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ anaerobically at 37  C overnight and adding B.	2
@gm$ Roseburia @/gm$  species appear to be able to synthesize nearly all of their own amino acids de novo. This result was somewhat surprising given the high organic @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and nitrogen content of colon luminal contents; however, excreted amino acids have long been thought to be largely bound in proteins and faecal metagenomes reveal significant enrichments in amino acid biosynthetic genes relative to all sequenced bacterial genomes in KEGG. This may indicate either low bioavailability of free amino acids in the colon or fierce competition for amino acids among organisms. All of the  @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$  genomes we examined possessed complete proline biosynthesis pathways from glutamate and arginine biosynthesis pathways via citrulline and aspartate. However, all appeared to lack arginases and, therefore, possessed incomplete arginine cycles. All species of the genus  @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$  encode genes for the biosynthesis of aspartate from oxaloacetate and asparagine from aspartate. The entirety of the lysine biosynthesis pathway converting aspartate to lysine via the dehydrogenase branch is present throughout the genus. However, all three strains of  @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$  contain genes suggesting the presence of an additional alternative succinylation-dependent synthesis branch.	1
@gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, which has an important role in the degradation of @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ and hemicellulose, was the most dominant bacterium in the intestine of healthy individuals. To a certain extent, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ is able to promote cellular uptake of sugar and reduce insulin resistance. However, long-term intake of large amounts of sugar may lead to obesity due to the role of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ in promoting sugar absorption. In the present study, the relative abundance of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ in the intestinal tract of patients with T2DM was relatively low, which may have been due to the diet of these patients being hyperlipidic and high in protein. The low-fat diets were energy-balanced and required patients to increase their intake of carbohydrates and dietary fibre, including vegetables, fruits and grains, and control fat intake to <25% of the total daily energy intake. After 6 months of low-fat diet treatment, the relative abundance of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ in the intestine increased slightly.	2

@gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and Bacteroides xylanisolvens were enriched in patients without severe irAEs. Several microbial metabolic pathways involved in the @sm$ urea @/sm$ cycle, including citrulline and arginine biosynthesis, were associated with irAEs.	0
@gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$ produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$, formate, and lactate during growth on glucose on pure culture, but additionally produces propionate during growth on fucose, again using the propanediol utilization pathway.	1
@gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ CVD 1901, 0.04% guanine, 0.13 g/L @sm$ asparagine @/sm$, and 0.13 g/L methionine (for growth in a 7-L bioreactor); 0.08% guanine, 0.5 g/L @sm$ asparagine @/sm$, and 0.5 g/L methionine (for growth in a 75-L bioreactor);.	2
@gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ strain PS80 was previously shown to survive intracellularly within neutrophils isolated from @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ surgical site infections. We have now demonstrated that PS80 establishes its intracellular survival niche within phagocytes through subversion of the autophagic pathway. Following infection of BMDCs, PS80 prevented the constitutive degradation of autophagosomes by lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of LC3-II. In contrast, @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ strain SH1000 did not interfere with the homeostatic turnover of the autophagic machinery. Furthermore, BMDCs that had been treated with @sm$ MDC @/sm$ (which accumulates in the autophagosome) postinfection showed colocalization between the autophagosome and PS80 but not SH1000. In addition, macrophages that were stably transfected with GFP-LC3 also demonstrated colocalization of PS80 with LC3-II punctae, indicating the interaction of the bacterium with autophagosomes. Upon invasion of nonprofessional phagocytes, @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ was shown to subvert autophagy, enabling replication within the autophagosome and subsequent lysis of the host cell. Consistent with this, we have demonstrated that the cytotoxic effects exerted by @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ strain PS80 on BMDCs are associated with the subversion of autophagy.	3
@gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ TM300 exhibited the smallest genome (2,566,424 bp), while strain Mu2 possessed the largest (2,927,171 bp). Both of the S. equorum strains possessed genomes that were larger in size than the average of the 10 strains. The CNS strains displayed an average @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content of 33.29% and @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ showed the highest @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content.	0
@gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ cultures were grown 16 h in conical polypropylene tubes containing 5 ml of M9-Tris (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM MgSO4) salts supplemented with a mix of nutrients (45 mug/ml L-methionine, 20 mug/ml @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$, 12.5 mug/ml nicotinic acid, 10 mug/ml vitamin B1, 1% glucose, 0.5% casein hydrolysate, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) -M9-Tris-CAA- at 37  C with shaking at 200 rpm. This optimized reaction solution was based on an optimized minimal growth medium for Shigella and a buffer that permits septin assembly into filaments/bundles. The following day, bacterial cultures were diluted in 10 ml of fresh prewarmed M9-Tris-CAA (1:100 v/v) in conical polypropylene tubes and cultured until an OD600 of 0.6. 1.2 ml of bacterial cultures were centrifuged in Low Protein Binding tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 800 x g for 2 min at RT and the supernatant was removed. To measure binding of septins to @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 100 mul of in vitro reconstitution solution [M9-Tris-CAA supplemented with 240 nM of septin complex SEPT7/msGFP-SEPT6/SEPT2 and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)].	2
@gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and A. actinomycetemcomitans infection of Drosophila melanogaster flies was performed as previously described. Briefly, Drosophila flies were maintained on Jazz-Mix Drosophila food (Fisher). To infect flies, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ was grown to an A470 of 2.0 and 1.5 ml of the culture was harvested. A. actinomycetemcomitans was grown to an A470 of 0.8 and 4 ml of the culture was harvested. The harvested cell pellets of the two species were re-suspended respectively or mixed together in 100 mul sterile 5% sucrose to desirable cell density (109~1010 CFU/mL). The re-suspended cells were spotted onto a sterile 21-mm filter paper disc (Whatman) that was placed on the surface of 5 ml of solidified 5% sucrose agar in a plastic vial (FlyBase). Male Drosophila flies (1 to 3 days old) were treated with antibiotics (erythromycin, @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$, and ampicillin at 50 mug/ml) for 3 days and transferred to fresh medium for 3 days to remove residual antibiotics. All the flies were starved for 4 h before being added to vials (10 flies per vial). To determine the number of viable bacterial cells inside the flies, the surface of the flies were sterilized by treating with 70% ethanol for 30s and washed 3 times with sterile PBS. Flies were crushed with tips in an Eppendorf tube with 100 mul of saline. Serial dilutions of the homogenate were spread on TSBYE agar plates. Colonies of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ appeared after overnight incubation at 37 C. Colonies of A. actinomycetemcomitans were visible after 2 days incubation at 37 C. @sm$ Vancomycin @/sm$ (5mug/ml) was added to TSBYE agar plate to selectively grow A.	3
@gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ was injected intraperitoneally into mice (10 per group) at a dose of 1.5 x 108 cfu per mouse. As a negative control, 5 mice were infected with @sm$ PBS @/sm$.	0
@gm$ S. pneumoniae @/gm$ strains were grown as static cultures at 37  C in a casein hydrolysate-based liquid medium (AGCH) containing 0.2% yeast extract and 0.3% sucrose (@sm$ C @/sm$ + Y).	2
@gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infection is of major economic and veterinary importance in the farming world, and should now be on the list of differential diagnoses when clinicians encounter patients with unexplained sepsis who have a history of exposure to pigs. Eradication of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ from the pig population is not currently feasible, even though @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ appears fully sensitive to @sm$ penicillin @/sm$. Antibiotic treatment in pigs is rarely successful, probably because of poor antibiotic penetration of the porcine tonsillar tissues, which act as a source of infection . Resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline is common, limiting efforts to clear tonsillar carriage. Development of a vaccine targeted against the most virulent or prevalent strains might be one possible way to prevent colonisation of female pigs and to protect those working with pigs . Better characterisation of activities that increase risk of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ acquisition and faster diagnostic tests to identify outbreaks in pigs will lead to adaptation of practices that incur unnecessary exposure to infected carcasses.	3
@gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, A. muciniphila, Escherichia sp., and I. bartlettii respectively had 4, 2, 1 and 1 double lethal pairs involving 2 exchange reactions. Simultaneous inhibition of NMN exchange and @sm$ nicotinate @/sm$, or L-tyrosine coupled with glycyl-L-tyrosine, or phosphate paired with glycerol 3-phosphate and uracil paired with succinate became lethal in @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$. In A. muciniphila inhibiting the exchange of L-asparagine together with glycyl-L-asparagine or thiamin led to lethality. Notably, simultaneous blocking of exchange of oxygen with ferric iron (Fe3+) or @sm$ nicotinate @/sm$, respectively prevented growth in Escherichia sp.	2
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ (S. Choleraesuis) is a swine-adapted serovar associated to invasive infections in humans. In Brazil, data of strains of this serovar are scarce. In the present study, six S. Choleraesuis strains of animal (n = 5) and human (n = 1) origin from Brazil were screened for phenotypic antimicrobial resistance using disk-diffusion assay and using whole-genome sequencing data to search for antimicrobial resistance genes, plasmids, prophages, and @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ pathogenicity islands (SPIs). Its genetic relatedness was evaluated by MLST and SNP analysis. A single isolate from swine gallbladder harbored the colistin resistance gene mcr-1.1 into a IncX4 plasmid. In the six strains analyzed, resistance was found to tetracycline, @sm$ nalidixic acid @/sm$, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, streptomycin, cefazoline, gentamycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and choloramphenicol, along with resistance genes aac(6')-Iaa, aac(3)-IV, aph(3'')-Ib, aph(6)-Id, aph(4)-Ia, aadA1, aph(3')-IIa, blaTEM-1A, floR, sul1, sul2, tet(B), drfA1, erm(B), mph(B), lnu(G), qacE, and gyrA point mutation Serine83   Tyrosine and parC Threonine57   Serine.	4
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$, a host-adapted pathogen of swine, usually causes septicemia. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains have been widely studied in recent years for their probiotic properties. In this study, a mouse infection model first screened for potential agents against infection, then a pig infection model evaluated effects of LAB strains and herbal plants against infection. Scutellariae radix (SR) and Gardeniae fructus (GF) showed abilities to reduce bacteria shedding and suppressing serum level of TNF- alpha induced by infection in swine. Bioactivities of SR and GF were enhanced by combining with LAB strains, which alone could speed up the bacteria elimination time in feces and boost immunity of infected pigs. Baicalein and @sm$ genipin @/sm$ exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than baicalin and geniposide did, as well as prevent @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ from invading macrophages.	3
@gm$ Salmonella paratyphi-B @/gm$ CMCC 50094, Salmonella paratyphi-A CMCC 50093, Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae CMCC(@sm$ B) @/sm$47001, Salmonella typhimurium CMCC 50015 and Escherichia coli DH5alpha were purchased from the National Center for Medical Culture Collections (CMCC).	0
"@gm$ Shigella @/gm$ does not make flagella and is nonmotile. The plaque assay measures cell-to-cell spread of intracellular @gm$ Shigella @/gm$, and so it suggested that @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ must express some other means of motility while in the mammalian cytoplasm. More than 20 years earlier, Hidemasa Ogawa at the National Institute of Health in Tokyo, Japan, used phase-contrast video microscopy to show that intracellular @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ do, in fact, display rapid random movements in the host cell cytoplasm. Ogawa noted, ""When virulent bacilli entered into the tissue cells, they exhibited an unexpected vigorous movement. This movement was apparently random, not directional, and independent of the movement of intracellular organelle..."". This movement frequently led to formation of protrusions of the host cytoplasm. The observation that @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ inhibited intracellular bacterial movement also suggested the role of a @gm$ Shigella @/gm$-specific factor."	3
@gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. were the only bacteria in these microbial communities that encoded all of the enzymes in the 2,3-butanedione pathway. budA was not present in P. aeruginosa (in these CF metagenomes from San Diego nor in publically available fully sequenced genomes, and budC was not present in the highly abundant R. mucilaginosa. However, R. mucilaginosa and/or P. aeruginosa have the ability to consume 2,3-butanedione, as they encode acoA and acoB, the genes whose products catabolize @sm$ acetoin @/sm$ for use in central metabolism.	2
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is an important swine pathogen and an emergent zoonotic pathogen. Excessive inflammation caused by @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is responsible for early high mortality in septic shock-like syndrome cases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may contribute to regulating inflammatory processes. This study shows that mouse infection by @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is accompanied by an increase of arachidonic acid, a proinflammatory omega-6 (omega-6) PUFA, and by a decrease of docosahexaenoic acid, an anti-inflammatory omega-3 PUFA. Macrophages infected with @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ showed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation. Fenretinide, a synthetic @sm$ vitamin A @/sm$ analog, reduced in vitro expression of inflammatory mediators. Pretreatment of mice with fenretinide significantly improved their survival by reducing systemic proinflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of an S. suis infection. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of fenretinide in diminishing the expression of inflammation and improving survival during an acute infection by a virulent @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ strain.	3
@gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ is stimulated by the contribution of amino acids and small peptides coming from the proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. The stimulation of Lactobacillus bulgaricus is allotted to formic acid, pyruvic acid, and carbon dioxide produced by @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$. Both microbial species are homofermentative bacteria, which produce lactic acid starting from @sm$ lactose @/sm$ milk.	2
@gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ species produce butyrate and @sm$ lactate @/sm$ as major products of glucose and some other carbohydrates. @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ is a known butyrate producer living in human intestine and represents 1% of total @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ population. @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ also produces small amounts of acetate and succinate in addition to its main products.	1
@gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$, the only specie of this genus, which is more abundant in patients with MetS, was shown to produce mainly butyrate and lactate from @sm$ glucose @/sm$.	1
@gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ cells, wild type or mutant (Tdm101, Tdm109, Tdm111), were grown in TYGVS broth overnight at 37 C in a Coy anaerobic chamber (5% CO2, 10% H2, 85% N2). Cell concentrations in the cultures were measured by their optical density at 620nm and equivalent numbers of cells (equal to the number of cells in 1 mL of a culture at OD620nm) were removed from each sample into centrifuge tubes. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 mL PBS, centrifuged again and the final cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS. A 0.5 mL aliquot was removed from each sample into a new tube, 10 muL of freshly prepared L-cysteine HCl (100 mM) was added and the samples were covered with parafilm and incubated aerobically for 2 hr in a water bath at 37 C. Then the @sm$ H2S @/sm$ produced by the various @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ strains was assayed as described by Siegel with some modifications. Briefly, 50 muL of 0.02 M N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 N HCl and 50 muL of 0.3 M FeCl3 in 1.2 N HCl were added sequentially to each tube. After color development for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged briefly and the absorbance of each supernatant was measured at 620 nm. The sulfide concentration was determined from a standard curve with Na2S as the substrate. The three @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ mutants and wild type spirochetes were grown together and assessed for @sm$ H2S @/sm$ production on four different days. The data @sm$ H2S @/sm$ concentrations are expressed as means +- standard deviations.	1
@gm$ T. forsythensis @/gm$ cells were fixed first with 4% paraformaldehyde-0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, (@sm$ PBS @/sm$) at 4  C for 60 min, then postfixed with 1% potassium ferricyanide-reduced OsO4 at 4  C for 60 min.	3
@gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ was cultured by adding 10 mug/mL N-acetylmuraminic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to the above medium. T. denticola was added to the heart infusion broth with 1.0% trypticase peptone, 0.25% yeast extract, 0.05% sodium thioglycollate, 0.1% l-cysteine HCl-H2O, 0.025% l-asparagine, 0.2% d-glucose, 0.0001% resazurin, 0.20025% @sm$ sodium bicarbonate @/sm$, 2% rabbit serum, and 2% thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)/volatile fatty acid solution (0.03% TPP, 0.05% isobutyric acid, 0.05% 2-methylbutyric acid, 0.05% isovaleric acid, 0.05% valeric acid, and 0.098 N sodium hydroxide).	2
@gm$ Tannerella @/gm$ and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque. The anaerobic @gm$ Tannerella @/gm$ requires a much lower pO2 than Streptococcus and is proteolytic, while Streptococcus is a saccharolytic colonizer of the tooth surface that uses sugars as its primary source of carbon and is @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ tolerant. This continuous nutritional, metabolite (e.g. hydrogen peroxide), and @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ gradient between the supragingval and the subgingival biofilms, along with differential exposure to host factors in saliva, is reflected through the gradual drop of the abundance of @gm$ Tannerella @/gm$ as the streptococci increase (Figure S4).	3
@gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$, although sensitive to atmospheric concentrations of O2, requires low levels of O2 for optimal survival and metabolic activity. The addition of 0.0125-0.2 mg/ml of sodium metabisulfite to a basal medium consisting of Eagle's minimal essential medium and 50% fresh, heat-inactivated normal rabbit serum was found to have an effect similar to that of @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$ in extending the survival of @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ (Nichols strain) under 3% O2. Detailed analysis of the effect of O2 tension revealed that 50% motility was retained longest at atmospheric O2 concentrations of 1-5%, whether or not @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$ or sodium metabisulfite were present. Concentrations of O2 of 3-10% were optimal for nucleic acid synthesis, as determined by [3H]adenine incorporation during the first 24 hr of incubation. Sodium metabisulfite was less effective than @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$ in stimulating nucleic acid synthesis. Neither sodium metabisulfite nor @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$ at their effective concentrations had any effect on levels of dissolved O2. During incubation under 3% O2, motility was maintained at > 50% for 15 days and virulence for at least 13 days by dilution of the treponemal suspensions every three days with fresh medium containing sodium metabisulfite. The optimal retention of motility and nucleic acid synthesis under microaerobic conditions in the absence of reducing compounds provides further evidence that @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ is a microaerophilic organism.	3
@gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$, an obligate parasite of humans and the causative agent of syphilis, has evolved the capacity to exploit host-derived metabolites for its survival. Flavin-containing compounds are essential cofactors that are required for metabolic processes in all living organisms, and riboflavin is a direct precursor of the cofactors FMN and @sm$ FAD @/sm$. Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ cannot synthesize riboflavin; we recently described a flavin-uptake mechanism composed of an ABC-type transporter. However, there is a paucity of information about flavin utilization in bacterial periplasms. Using a discovery-driven approach, we have identified the TP0796 lipoprotein as a previously uncharacterized Mg(2+)-dependent FAD pyrophosphatase within the ApbE superfamily. TP0796 probably plays a central role in flavin turnover by hydrolyzing exogenously acquired @sm$ FAD @/sm$, yielding AMP and FMN. Biochemical and structural investigations revealed that the enzyme has a unique bimetal Mg(2+) catalytic center. Furthermore, the pyrophosphatase activity is product-inhibited by AMP, indicating a possible role for this molecule in modulating FMN and @sm$ FAD @/sm$ levels in the treponemal periplasm.	2
@gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is sensitive to most antibiotics in vitro, except for colistin; antibiotics that are effective against @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ in vitro are third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime), piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem), tetracyclines (doxycycline or tetracycline), aminoglycoside (gentamicin or amikacin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or @sm$ moxifloxacin @/sm$), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprime. In most in vitro or in vivo mouse model experiments on antibiotic susceptibility, tetracyclines are reported to have significantly higher efficacy than penicillin or cephalosporins. This has been attributed to the fact that the tetracycline class of antibiotics achieves better penetration into tissues with poor perfusion when V. vulnificus infection occurs, and has inhibitory effects against the synthesis of proteins, such as various toxins and enzymes produced by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$.	3
@gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ species, which metabolize lactate, were also less predominant in later plaque (Figure 8), in accordance with several previous studies, indicating that elevated levels of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ were associated with higher acid production within plaque. The developing plaque in CF subjects likely had a lower acidogenic potential than that in CE subjects during the later stage of the current study period. Because formation, succession, and removal of dental plaque on the tooth surface occur repeatedly, the differences observed in the assembly process may be involved in the susceptibility to dental caries. Further evaluation of the microbiota shift upon @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ ingestion and pH measurement within dental plaque would be helpful to clarify their contribution to the progression of dental caries.	2
@gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ is a common marine food-borne enteropathogen. In this study, we examined the antioxidative activity, growth, biofilm formation, and cell mobility of an oxyR deletion mutant and its genetically complementary strain of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$. oxyR is the regulator of catalase and ahpC genes. Protection against extrinsic H2O2 and against the organic peroxides cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide was weaker in the deletion mutant than in its parent strain. Expression of the major functional antioxidative genes, ahpC1 and VPA1418, was markedly decreased in the oxyR mutant. Growth of this mutant on agar medium was significantly inhibited by autoclaved 0.25% @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and by 0.25% dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.5% monosaccharides (@sm$ glucose @/sm$, galactose, xylose, and arabinose), or 114.8 mM phosphates. The inhibition of the growth of this oxyR mutant by extrinsic peroxides, autoclaved sugars, and phosphates was eliminated by the complementary oxyR gene or by the addition of catalase to the autoclaved medium, while no inhibition of growth was observed when filter-sterilized sugars were used. The formation of biofilm and swimming mobility were significantly inhibited in the oxyR mutant relative to that in the wild-type strain. This investigation demonstrates the antioxidative function of oxyR in @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ and its possible roles in biofilm formation, cell mobility, and the protection of growth in heated rich medium.	3
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a rod shape, Gram-negative bacterium and is a member of family Vibrionaceae. Worldwide this lethal pathogen causes seafood-related deaths in humans. @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ causes sepsis greater than 50% mortality rate, necrotizing fasciitis, gastroenteritis, skin and soft tissue infection, wound infection, peritonitis, meningitis, pneumonia, keratitis, and arthritis. Chronic liver disease, kidney disease, hemochromatosis, immune deficiency and heart diseases are the predominant risk factors for @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$. Pili, Cytotoxin, hydrolytic enzyme, flagella, and capsule polysaccharide are the feasible virulent determinant for @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$. Based on pathogenicity @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is categorized into three biotypes. Type 1 and type 3 cause diseases in humans, while biotype 2 causes diseases in eel and fishes. The majority of microorganisms that cause infections are resistant to antibiotics. Due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ has developed resistance to many antibiotics so curing is dramatically a challenge. Pan et al. stated that @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ showed resistant to cefazolin, streptomycin, tetracycline, aztreonam, tobramycin, cefepime and gentamycin. The mechanism by which @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ interact with different factors of host defense was investigated by researchers to understand its pathogenicity better. The first host defense encounter by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is the highly acidic environment of the stomach. To neutralize low-pH of the environment Gram-negative bacteria catabolize @sm$ amino acids @/sm$ to amines and carbon dioxide, to encounter acidic environment @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ utilize the same strategy.	2
@gm$ Y      . enterocolitica @/gm$ biotype 1A isolates were selected from the strain collection of the National Reference Centre for Salmonella and other enteric pathogens, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany. All strains were routinely cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. To avoid possible stimulation of virulence gene expression, all strains were cultured at 27 C for standard procedures except for infection studies. Where appropriate, antibiotics were supplemented as follows: kanamycin at 30 mug/mL, @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ at 30 mug/mL.	4
@gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ and Y. pestis possess two pairs of convergently transcribed luxI/R orthologs (ypsI/R, ytbI/R and ypeI/R and yepI/R, respectively). Both species produce the same four major AHLs, namely N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), N-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C8-HSL), and N-(3-oxooctananoyl) homoserine lactone (@sm$ 3-oxo-C8-HSL @/sm$)).	1
@gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$, the causative agent of the bubonic plague, is a predominately extracellular pathogen with the ability to survive and replicate intracellularly. A previous study has shown that a novel rip (required for intracellular proliferation) operon (ripA, ripB and ripC) is essential for replication and survival of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ in postactivated macrophages, by playing a role in lowering macrophage-produced nitric oxide (NO) levels. A bioinformatics analysis indicates that the rip operon is conserved among a distally related subset of macrophage-residing pathogens, including Burkholderia and Salmonella species, and suggests that this previously uncharacterized pathway is also required for intracellular survival of these pathogens. The focus of this study is ripA, which encodes for a protein highly homologous to 4-hydroxybutyrate-CoA transferase; however, biochemical analysis suggests that RipA functions as a butyryl-CoA transferase. The 1.9 A X-ray crystal structure reveals that RipA belongs to the class of Family I CoA transferases and exhibits a unique tetrameric state. Molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with RipA tetramer formation and suggest a possible gating mechanism for @sm$ CoA @/sm$ binding mediated by Val227. Together, our structural characterization and molecular dynamic simulations offer insights into acyl-CoA specificity within the active site binding pocket, and support biochemical results that RipA is a butyryl-CoA transferase. We hypothesize that the end product of the rip operon is butyrate, a known anti-inflammatory, which has been shown to lower NO levels in macrophages. Thus, the results of this molecular study of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ RipA provide a structural platform for rational inhibitor design, which may lead to a greater understanding of the role of RipA in this unique virulence pathway.	2
@gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ has a broad host range and is capable of infecting a wide variety of animals, including humans. The disease caused by this bacterium may vary from a mild enteritis to extra-intestinal symptoms and septicemia. The severity of symptoms differs among strains, and @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ has been subdivided into genetic groups designated G1-G6, dependent on the presence of the virulence plasmid (pYV), the high pathogenicity island (HPI), and the subtype of the @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$-derived mitogen (YPM). G4 isolates cannot ferment @sm$ melibiose @/sm$ (@sm$ melibiose @/sm$-negative) and are not pathogenic: they express YPMb and lack the pYV and HPI. G5 isolates are also @sm$ melibiose @/sm$-negative and of low pathogenicity: they express YPMc, and contain the pYV as well as a truncated HPI (R-HPI). G1-G3 and G6 isolates are @sm$ melibiose @/sm$-positive and fully pathogenic: they contain the pYV, and variably harbour the HPI and YPMa. Although human cases of @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ infections are usually sporadic, several outbreaks have recently been reported from Finland and Russia. Humans are not the primary host for @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$. These bacteria can be isolated from a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, as well as from the environment in Japan and occasionally in Europe. @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ has also been subdivided on the basis of variable lipopolysaccharide O-side chain into 15 O-serotypes (O:1-O:15) and ten subtypes (O:1a-c, O:2a-c, O:4a-b and O:5a-b).	2
@gm$ canis @/gm$ (serum agglutination test <50 IU/mL) and bacteriologic culture of a urine sample were negative. Despite treatment with @sm$ doxycycline @/sm$ (10 mg/kg 1x/d for 14 days starting 3 days after neuter), the dog did not recuperate and because of the poor prognosis was euthanized.	3
@gm$ jejuni @/gm$ cannot ferment carbohydrates and depends mainly on amino acids and some SCFAs to proliferate in the avian gut. C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ utilizes @sm$ acetate @/sm$, lactate, fumarate, succinate, and malate as part of its citric acid cycle to satisfy its energy needs. The ability of C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ to use SCFAs might explain the ineffectiveness of organic acid supplementation such as lactic acid, formic acid, and acetic acid in the presented studies. Butyrate supplementation might be the organic acid of choice to control C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$.	2
@gm$ jejuni @/gm$ was associated with important alteration of gut microbial predicted metabolism and functions. It could partly be explained by the microbiota functional enrichment in pathways involved in the biosynthesis of antimicrobial synthesis and bacteriocin (i.e. bacterial toxins) as previously observed in suckling piglets supplemented with benzoic acid and essential oils (Zhai et al., ). Besides support of gut barrier integrity, immune activation and nutrient competition, secretion of antimicrobial products allow the gut microbiota with colonization resistance (Ducarmon et al., ). Altogether, these mechanisms might explain both the resistance to C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ development, the associated decrease of enteropathogens (Sassone-Corsi et al., ) and the microbiota structure specificity induced by the carvacrol-based product in chickens inoculated with C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$. In inoculated chickens, the carvacrol-based product down-regulated the predicted degradation pathways of lysine, valine, leucine and @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ while up-regulated biosynthesis of lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. In accordance, Li et al. observed in piglets group supplemented with a mix of carvacrol and thymol, an increased concentration of several amino acids such as valine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ and alanine (Li et al., ).	2
@gm$ jejuni @/gm$. Firstly, irrespective of the selective agent, the resistant clones obtained in vitro exhibited dual resistance to both agents (Table 2 ). Similar cross-resistance was previously reported in E. coli and Salmonella , which usually emerged under FFC selection. Combined resistance to CHL and FFC might be conferred by specific resistance genes, such as floR , fexA , fexB , pexA  and cfr . Secondly, both the CHL- (MICCHL>=64 microg/mL) and FFC-selected (MICFFC>=32 microg/mL) resistant strains contained the G2073A mutation in three copies of the 23S rRNA gene (Table 2 ), which is the first reported mutation associated with amphenicol resistance in Campylobacter spp. The G2057A mutation of the E. coli 23S rRNA gene (corresponding to position 2073 in the 23S rRNA gene of Campylobacter spp.) was previously reported to confer resistance to chloramphenicol and intermediate-level resistance to 14-nunbered-ring macrolides. Indeed, the CHL- and FFC-selected C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ mutants carrying the G2073A mutation also showed elevated MICs to @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ (8 microg/mL), consistent with the finding in E. coli that the G2057A conferred cross resistance to chloramphenicol and @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$. Interestingly in propionibacteria, Mycoplasma hominis , and Francisella tularensis , the same G2057A mutation was associated with @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ resistance, but not with resistance to 16-membered macrolides or chloramphenicol.	4
@gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ se obtuvo sensibilidad a penicilina, clindamicina, eritromicina, levofloxacino y @sm$ vancomicina @/sm$, mientras que a A.	3
@sm$ Acarbose @/sm$ is a clinically used drug produced by Actinoplanes sp. and is composed of acarviosin bound to maltose. @sm$ Acarbose @/sm$ exerts its anti-diabetic effect by inhibiting alpha-glucosidases and alpha-amylases, which are required for the breakdown of starch into glucose, resulting in reduced uptake of glucose into the bloodstream and prevention of postprandial hyperglycemia. Since @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ hinders the absorption of glucose in the upper gastrointestinal tract, an increased concentration of oligosaccharides transits to the colon where fermentation by gut bacteria can lead to unwanted gastrointestinal side effects. In addition, @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ can directly affect the microbiota through inhibition of bacterial amylases. Santilli et al. showed that @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ can inhibit the growth of B. thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides fragilis on potato starch. This growth phenotype was postulated to be a result of SusG inhibition, as growth of the two bacteria on glucose was not affected by @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ treatment. In contrast, the growth of R. bromii on starch was not affected by @sm$ acarbose @/sm$. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used to identify changes to the gut microbiota structure from @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ treatment, in conjunction with measures of metabolites and physiological markers of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or other metabolic diseases. Restructuring of the gut microbiota in T2D by @sm$ acarbose @/sm$ is often accompanied by a decrease in overall bacterial diversity,- despite an increase in Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ taxa in a variety of animal models and patient populations.- There is generally also an increase in SCFA production, particularly of butyrate,- which could result from the enrichment of butyrate-producing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.	3
@sm$ Acetate @/sm$ can be synthesized through two different pathways. Firstly, acetyl-CoA can be produced by decarboxylation of pyruvate, then, acetyl-CoA is hydrolyzed to @sm$ acetate @/sm$ by an acetyl-CoA hydrolase. Most of the @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is produced by enteric bacteria, including Prevotella spp., Ruminococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Streptococcus spp., A. muciniphila, and @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, using this pathway. Secondly, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway can be also used by acetogenic bacteria to form @sm$ acetate @/sm$ from acetyl-CoA. Here, the reduction of carbon dioxide generates carbon monoxide, which reacts with a coenzyme A molecule and a methyl group to produce acetyl-CoA. At the same time, acetyl-CoA is the substrate to obtain @sm$ acetate @/sm$.	1
@sm$ Acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate are the main components in SCFAs, of which @sm$ acetate @/sm$ can be produced through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway by @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, and propionate is generated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes through the succinate and lactate pathway, and the remaining butyrate being produced by several Firmicutes through Acetyl-CoA.	1
@sm$ Alcohol @/sm$ consumption, particularly chronic and moderate to heavy @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ intake, has been recognized as an important risk factor for CRC, and is closely related to the metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC patients. The metabolism of @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ is actively modulated by the gut microbiota, which regulates ethanol conversion into its metabolites that exert carcinogenic effects in the colon. For example, Enterobacteriaceae Ruminococcus, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ mediate the production of carcinogenic acetaldehyde from ethanol, which accumulates in the colon and greatly contribute to CRC development as ethanol consumption increases. Furthermore, the gut microbiota in alcoholic people is diminished in dominant obligate anaerobes (such as Bacteroides and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$) and enriched in Streptococcus, which in turn contribute to CRC development according to their cancer-inhibiting or -promoting functions as discussed in Section 3.	1
@sm$ Amino glycoside @/sm$ resistance genes strA, strB, aadA and aacA4 (83.3-100%), and integron genes IntI and 3'-CS (97.5-100%) were widely observed among the strains harvested from the 0.1 to 50 mg L-1 STM exposures (Table 3; Additional file 1: Table S7), whereas STM resistance genes strA and strB (50.0%) and integron genes IntI (30%) and 3'-CS (70%) were also observed in the exposure without STM. In addition, other @sm$ amino glycoside @/sm$ genes including aac(3)-II, aphA1, aphA2, aadE and aadB, were not notably distributed (0-17.5%) among the various STM exposures. In particular, the aadE gene (confers resistance to STM and spectinomycin) was observed only in Lactococcus chungangensis (1-50 mg L-1), whereas none of the STM resistant strains contained the aac(3)-II gene (confers resistance to gentamycin, tobramycin and kanamycin). In this study, Lactococcus chungangensis and Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila exhibited the maximum number of @sm$ amino glycoside @/sm$ resistance genes (six), whereas Paracoccus yeei, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana and Chryseobacterium lactis contained five @sm$ amino glycoside @/sm$ resistance genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S4) and Aeromonas veronii and Comamonas testosteroni contained three @sm$ amino glycoside @/sm$ resistance genes.	4
@sm$ Aminoglycosides @/sm$ treatment in healthy volunteers has been associated with a decrease in Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium spp. and @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ spp..	3
@sm$ Amoxycillin @/sm$, oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are the most commonly used antimicrobials in poultry, followed by ofloxacin and norfloxacin in China. Inclusion in feed is the most common route of administration of antimicrobials in poultry, mainly to prevent necrotic enteritis caused by @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ and coccidiosis.	3
@sm$ Anthocyanins @/sm$, a particular class of flavonoids, are enriched in fruits and vegetables, and could be metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, @sm$ anthocyanins @/sm$ and their metabolites could enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobaterium and Lactobacillus) and reduce a group of potentially harmful bacteria, such as Clostridium histolyticum. Similar results in the Bifidobaterium have also been described in human volunteers after 6-week consumption of a blueberry drink. In addition, a recent study examined the microbial associations of circulating equol, a metabolite of dietary soy isoflavones, and found higher @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ and Coprococcus catus but lower abundances of Ruminococcus gnavus were associated with equols.	0
@sm$ Azelastine @/sm$, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. Hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. @sm$ Azelastine @/sm$ significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine Gram-positive clinical isolates: five Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$, seven of which were multi-drug resistant, reversing their resistance to the tested antibiotics. The synergistic effects of @sm$ azelastine @/sm$ with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the pH from 5 to 8. Antibiotics did not affect the ability of @sm$ azelastine @/sm$ to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. The findings of this study present @sm$ azelastine @/sm$ as a potential 'helper compound' that could reverse the resistance of multi-drug resistant Gram-positive clinical isolates to antibiotics.	4
@sm$ B. @/sm$ Cefuroxim) weniger wirksam erwiesen als Cephalosporine der 3. Generation (Cefotaxim, Ceftriaxon). Alternativ konnen auch Levofloxacin oder Moxifloxacin zum Einsatz kommen, da diese Substanzen eine Wirksamkeit gegenuber Pneumokokken besitzen. Obwohl Levofloxacin eine gute In-vitro-Wirksamkeit gegen Pneumokokken aufweist, sind Therapieversager beschrieben. Cephalosporine der 3. Generation sind aber zur Therapie von @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ nicht geeignet; Mittel der ersten Wahl zur Behandlung von @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ sind Flucloxacillin, Cephalosporine der 1. Generation (z. B. Cefazolin) oder Cephalosporine der 2. Generation (z. @sm$ B. @/sm$ Cefuroxim).	3
@sm$ Bazedoxifene @/sm$ (@sm$ BZA @/sm$), which belongs to a new generation of SERMs, shows the ability to inhibit the growth of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ in macrophages and is associated with autophagy. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized antibacterial function of @sm$ BZA @/sm$.	3
@sm$ Carbapenem @/sm$-resistance among human invasive Escherichia coli strains was still reported to be rare in all EU/EEA countries, with a population weighted mean percentage of 0.1% in 2017 (ECDC,). @sm$ Carbapenem @/sm$-resistance combined with resistance to other important antimicrobial groups was commonly reported in P. aeruginosa in many EU/EEA countries in 2017, with a weighted mean of 17.4% (ECDC,). Unlike other bacteria, carbapenemresistance in P. aeruginosa is multifactorial, due to plasmid or integron-coded carbapenemases, increased expression of efflux systems, reduced porin expression and increased chromosomal cephalosporinase activity (Meletis et al.,). Regarding Acinetobacter baumanni, the epidemiological situation for @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistance strains has been worsening in several European countries. Like K. pneumoniae and E. coli, @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistance in A. baumannii is often mediated by carbapenemases production. In 2017, several European countries reported high percentages of resistance against @sm$ carbapenems @/sm$ in @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp., which ranged from 0.0% in some northern countries (Denmark, Norway and Sweden) to 96.2% (Croatia).	4
@sm$ Carnosol @/sm$ and carnosic acid, together with ursolic acid, which was not highlighted as a bioactive compound, have been reported to be responsible for the antibacterial activity of extracts of sage or S. officinalis toward MRSA when tested using the microdilution method. Salvia officinalis leaves are rich in methyl carnosate, a diterpene compound with good antibacterial activity towards @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$.	3
@sm$ Cholic acid @/sm$ enhances the abundance of opportunistic gut bacteria such as Prevotella and Desulfovibrio and reduces the abundance of Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, which drive gastrointestinal tumorigenesis through overproduction of the toxic substance, DCA.	3
@sm$ Cinnamic acid @/sm$ was the most abundant phenolic acid in the fermented C. lanceolata. The highest DPPH scavenging activities were observed for HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF, with minimum EC(50) values of 1.26 and 1.18 mg/mL, respectively. The HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF samples exhibited the most noticeable antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$ (MICs<15 mg/mL).	3
@sm$ Cr @/sm$ level in the feces of the Cr(VI) group was markedly higher than that in the control group, increasing from 0.0056 +- 0.0021 mg/g to 0.3055 +- 0.06872 mg/g at day 10 (p < 0.0001), and the level increased progressively with time. With BT36 intervention, the @sm$ Cr @/sm$ content in the feces was further increased on day 10 (0.3785 +- 0.0356 mg/g wet feces, p = 0.0034), day 20 (0.4667 +- 0.0305 mg/g, p < 0.001) and day 30 (0.5278 +- 0.0577 mg/g, p < 0.001). In comparison, the promoting effect of strain @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ XS40, which presented a lower Cr(VI)-resisting and antioxidation capacity than BT36 (Supplementary Fig.	4
@sm$ Ellagitannins @/sm$ (@sm$ ETs @/sm$) and ellagic acid (EA) are polyphenolic compounds abundantly present in walnuts and fruits, such as strawberries and pomegranate. The metabolization of EA by the specific members of the gut microbiota, such as Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$ (Eggerthellaceae family) generates another class of metabolites known as urolithins, comprising urolithin A-D.	1
@sm$ Enrofloxacin @/sm$ is a fluoroquinolone group antibacterial drug developed for use in veterinary medicine. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as Mycoplasma spp.. @sm$ Enrofloxacin @/sm$ has a bactericidal effect by inhibiting the activity of bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV enzymes. In both mammalian and nonmammalian species, @sm$ enrofloxacin @/sm$ is dealkylated to ciprofloxacin, which exhibits a potency and spectrum of activity similar to @sm$ enrofloxacin @/sm$. @sm$ Enrofloxacin @/sm$ is widely used in fish due to its properties such as good absorption, large volume of distribution, high bioavailability, and long terminal half-life. Although @sm$ enrofloxacin @/sm$ is included in category B (Restrict) in the classification of antibiotics for veterinary use in terms of the risk of antimicrobial resistance by the EMA, it has been stated that it can be used in fish in cases in which there are few alternative treatment options, such as Aeromonas infection. @sm$ Enrofloxacin @/sm$ is used in diseases such as septicaemia, furunculosis, enteric red mouth, vibriosis or skin diseases in fish due to its effectiveness against bacteria such as @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp., Vibrio spp., and Yersinia spp..	3
@sm$ Esomeprazole @/sm$ was dosed to the nearest capsule size to achieve an oral dose of approximately 1 mg/kg once daily. @sm$ Esomeprazole @/sm$ is commercially available as 20 mg delayed-release capsules and was compounded by the UW Veterinary Care (UWVC) pharmacy into 10 and 30 mg capsules as needed. Participants were instructed to give the @sm$ esomeprazole @/sm$ on an empty stomach 30 minutes before feeding. A multi-strain probiotic was dosed to the nearest capsule size to a goal of at least 15 billion CFU/kg based on previously published guidelines for the treatment of canine inflammatory bowel disease as well as manufacturer recommendations. The probiotic capsules contained 4 live strains of Lactobacilli (L. plantarum DSM24730TM, L. paracasei DSM24733TM, L. acidophillus DSM24735TM, and L. delbueckii subp. Bulgaricus DSM24734TM), 3 live strains of Bifidobacteria (B. longum DSM24736TM, B. infantis DSM24747TM, and B. breve DSM24732TM), 1 live strain of @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ thermophiles DSM24731TM with microcrystalline cellulose, stearic acid, and magnesium sulfate in a vegetable capsule. This specific probiotic blend is sold under the brand name Visbiome Vet in the USA and Canada. The probiotic was administered simultaneously with @sm$ esomeprazole @/sm$ as the Visbiome label recommends it be given on an empty stomach and a previous study showed that probiotics administered 30 minutes after a meal did not survive in as high of numbers as those administered 30 minutes before a meal.	0
@sm$ Estradiol @/sm$-treated mice are often used as animal models to establish the colonization of pathogens associated with human reproductive tract infections, such as G. vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The pH of @sm$ estradiol @/sm$-treated mouse vagina (pH range 5.8-7.2) is conducive to the colonization of BV-associated bacteria, which can be inoculated to evaluate the in vivo microbicidal activities of TP4 microbicide formulations. In this study, we established a murine model of single- or dual-species vaginal colonization by G. vaginalis and @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$, or lactobacilli. We demonstrated that TP4 microbicide formulation decreases the colonization density of BV-associated bacteria but not lactobacilli. Not surprisingly, metronidazole did not reduce the @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ survival in dual-species infected mice. However, the immunomodulatory effects of TP4 microbicide formulation could not be evaluated in this model because of a non-obvious inflammatory response in vaginal tissue and fluid (data not shown) in inoculated mice (observed after G. vaginalis, @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$, or dual-species).	3
@sm$ Ethyl acetate @/sm$ crude extract of Streptomyces VITNK9 evaluated for its efficacy as a protective agent against different fish-associated pathogens showed a moderate response against Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio harveyi, and @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$.	3
@sm$ Ethylene @/sm$ is a vital plant phytohormone that facilitates plant growth and development under non-stressed conditions. However, under stressed conditions, the level of @sm$ ethylene @/sm$ increases and negatively regulates plant growth. It restricts the elongation of root and transport of auxin, supports aging and extirpation of organs, and assists in the ripening of fruits. @sm$ Ethylene @/sm$ plays a key role in the activation of plant defense against biotic stresses. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) is the primary precursor in plants for @sm$ ethylene @/sm$ synthesized by ACC synthase by converting S-adenosyl methionine. Under stressed conditions, the activity of ACC synthase increases and produces a high amount of @sm$ ethylene @/sm$. When the ACC is degraded by the ACC deaminase producing bacteria, the level of @sm$ ethylene @/sm$ decreased, which results in the elongation of roots. A diverse group of PGPR having ACC deaminase activity has been reported as Serratia, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Rhizobium, etc.. This PGPR with ACC deaminase activity hydrolyses the primary precursor ACC to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia and reduces the @sm$ ethylene @/sm$ level and improves plant health under stressed conditions.	2
@sm$ Fatty acid @/sm$ degradation, which is one of the pathways toward butyrate production, was up-regulated in both IN>=1- and IN<1-T1Ds compared to CTRLs. Particularly, PGs assigned to @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ and E.	1
@sm$ Fatty acids @/sm$ were the major metabolites perturbed across the liver, portal vein and gut microbiome in HCV, especially in patients with cirrhosis. Decreased @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ degradation by hepatic peroxisomes and mitochondria was coupled with increased free fatty acid (FFA) influx to the liver via the portal vein. Metatranscriptomics indicated that @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$-mediated @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ synthesis influences portal FFAs. Both microbial @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ synthesis and portal FFAs were associated with enhanced hepatic fibrosis.	1
@sm$ Fluconazole @/sm$'s resistance breakpoint concentrations for Candida spp. were recently investigated for their antibacterial effect against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. While quaternary ammonium derivatives of @sm$ fluconazole @/sm$ had a potent inhibitory effect, none of the bacteria tested were inhibited by @sm$ fluconazole @/sm$ alone. However, the experiments were based on standard methods for MIC determination that examine inhibition only when the bacteria have reached the stationary phase of growth. Another study showed that in plate agar assays, @sm$ fluconazole @/sm$ inhibited S. lividans, although to a lesser extent than imidazoles. Our results indicate that although the effects on @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ were not observed at the stationary phase, they were present at earlier growth phases. Accordingly, measurements of the density and viability of @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ revealed a delay in reaching the stationary phase in the presence of @sm$ fluconazole @/sm$.	3
@sm$ Glutathione @/sm$ (@sm$ GSH @/sm$) is a highly abundant tripeptide thiol that performs diverse protective and biosynthetic functions in cells. While changes in @sm$ GSH @/sm$ availability are associated with inborn errors of metabolism, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders, studying the limiting role of @sm$ GSH @/sm$ in physiology and disease has been challenging due to its tight regulation. To address this, we generated cell and mouse models that express a bifunctional @sm$ glutathione @/sm$-synthesizing enzyme from @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ (GshF), which possesses both glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthase activities. GshF expression allows efficient production of @sm$ GSH @/sm$ in the cytosol and mitochondria and prevents cell death in response to @sm$ GSH @/sm$ depletion, but not ferroptosis induction, indicating that @sm$ GSH @/sm$ is not a limiting factor under lipid peroxidation. CRISPR screens using engineered enzymes further revealed genes required for cell proliferation under cellular and mitochondrial @sm$ GSH @/sm$ depletion. Among these, we identified the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, GCLM, as a requirement for cellular sensitivity to buthionine sulfoximine, a @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ synthesis inhibitor. Finally, GshF expression in mice is embryonically lethal but sustains postnatal viability when restricted to adulthood. Overall, our work identifies a conditional mouse model to investigate the limiting role of @sm$ GSH @/sm$ in physiology and disease.	1
@sm$ Indole @/sm$ also has a significant number of reported biological properties beneficial to the human. As a derivative of tryptophan, @sm$ indole @/sm$ is used by bacteria as a signaling molecule. In addition, @sm$ indole @/sm$ helps maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier. In our study, we detected the @sm$ indole @/sm$ production by the most of the analyzed bacterial species. In @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ 807, B. eggerthii 91, B. intestinalis 181 and B. xylanisolvens EBA 5-17 large amount of @sm$ indole @/sm$ were detected.	1
@sm$ Indoles @/sm$ are bioactive products of the GM bacterial catabolism of tryptophan. Among these, 3-Indolepropionic acid (IPA), has been the subject of numerous studies due to its anticarcinogenic effects. IPA and other propionic acid species (PAs) derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine are synthesized through aromatic amino-acid transferases and phenyllactate dehydratase found in some species of the bacterial genera @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Akkermansia, Clostridium and Peptostreptococci. In general, @sm$ Indoles @/sm$ are also key interbacterial and GM-Host signaling molecules, act through steroid and xenobiotic receptors (AHRs and PXRs).	1
@sm$ LPS @/sm$ (200 ng/mL) alone or in combination with IFN-gamma (200 ng/mL) or LTA (1 mug/mL) were alternatively used to pre-stimulate THP-1 cells for 20 h before the infection with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$. To assess the influence of TLR2 signaling, a TLR2 blocking antibody was added to the cells 90 min before OMV stimulation at a final concentration of 20 mug/mL. NF-kappaB inhibition was achieved by incubation with 1 muM IKK XIII inhibitor prior to treatment. The influence of nucleic acids in the OMVs on @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ replication was analyzed by digestion of OMVs with RNase A (0.2 mug/muL) and RNase III (0.02 U/muL) in combination or DNase I (0.004 U/muL).	3
@sm$ LPS @/sm$ of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ O24 was isolated from the water phase by the hot phenol/water method with a yield of 1.7% and then analysed by SDS-PAGE. The @sm$ LPS @/sm$ was degraded with 1.5% acetic acid containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 100  C for 15 min.	1
@sm$ Lactate @/sm$ was even higher and acetate somewhat less suppressed as compared to neomycin. Butyrate production, however, was considerably higher than with untreated slurries. The latter is consistent with @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$'s metabolism, which is known to produce mainly butyrate from hexoses (Schwiertz et al.,; Duncan et al.,).	1
@sm$ Lactose @/sm$ hydrolysis was identified only in Firmicutes with exception of bin20 representing a member of Coriobacteriaceae. Most @sm$ lactose @/sm$-degrading bacteria (27 out of 31) hydrolyze @sm$ lactose @/sm$ by intracellular GH2 beta-galactosidase (BbgI, LacM, and BbgIV) or GH42 beta-galactosidase LacA, including members of Lactobacillus, @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, and Ruminococcus. The abundance of Lactobacillus delbrueckii, a species that is specialized for @sm$ lactose @/sm$ conversion, decreased over time (Fig. 2). The other @sm$ lactose @/sm$ decomposers were capable of @sm$ lactose @/sm$ hydrolysis by extracellular BbgIII (GH2).	2
@sm$ Lactose @/sm$-based prebiotics or their interaction with probiotics reduce osteoporosis and improve bone health via different mechanisms. The mechanisms are (a) transformation of insoluble inorganic salts to soluble by short-chain fatty acids and increase their absorption to the gut wall; (b) maintenance and protection of mineral absorption surface in the gut by promoting the proliferation of enterocytes and colonocytes, integrating gut epithelium cells and improving intestinal barrier defending activity, down-regulating the formation and activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, reducing oxidative stress, immunomodulation, genetic modulation, and increasing antimutagenic activity; (c) increase the expression of calcium-binding proteins in the gut wall by increasing calbindin-D9k gene expression; (d) remodel the formation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts by increasing calcium uptake by suppressing the activities of parathyroid hormone and synthesis of insulin-like growth factor 1; (e) release of bone modulating factors; and (f) degradation of mineral complexing phytic acid. The involvement of several gut microbiota, including probiotics, such as Butyricicoccus, Dialister, Oscillibacter, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacteria reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The detailed mechanisms of reduction of osteoporosis offered by @sm$ lactose @/sm$-based prebiotics and interaction with probiotics are presented in Figure 2 and subsequent sections.	2
@sm$ Lignans @/sm$, for instance, are present in foods such as flaxseeds, vegetables and fruits and its bioconversion by bacteria renders them possible to be digested and absorbed by the human organism, where they were shown to have a protective effect against cancer and other diseases. The conversion of @sm$ lignans @/sm$ into secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and the subsequent production of enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL), which are responsible for the beneficial effects of @sm$ lignans @/sm$, involves a very complex series of steps. Eleven bacterial strains were identified to be responsible for these series of processes including several species from the genus Clostridium and Bacteroides and individual species such as Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus and @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$.	2
"@sm$ Methane @/sm$, the TMA-metabolite produced by these archaea is usually considered biologically inert in humans. The pathway and relevant coding sequences for catalyzing TMA conversion to @sm$ methane @/sm$ by ""Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus"" and ""Ca. @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$"" based on annotation of the genomes we recently sequenced is shown in Figure 2; a similar pathway is inferred from the M."	1
@sm$ Methanol @/sm$ extract of C. asiatica from Soxhlet extraction was able to inhibit Aspergillus niger (14-19 mm), Fusarium oxysporum (13-14 mm), Xanthomonas campestris (10-13 mm), Lactobacillus acidophilus (11-13 mm), Pseudomonas marginalis (10-25 mm), Pseudomonas syringae (18-22 mm), Staphylococcus @gm$ salivarius @/gm$ (13-177 mm), and Staphylococcus aureus (9-12 mm), but exhibited no activity toward Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus mutans.	3
@sm$ Nitrate @/sm$ reduction to ammonia is a critical step of @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ metabolism in the rumen. It is reduced by nitrate reductase in assimilatory or dissimilatory way. Ruminal bacteria with @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reducing ability are S. ruminantium, @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$, M. succiniciproduces, W. succinogenes, and V. parvula. In this study, @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ increased the @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$, M. succiniciproducens, and S. ruminantium abundance significantly indicating that they were core nitrate-reducing bacteria in @sm$ nitrate @/sm$-adapted steers. However, the relative abundance of S. ruminantium was 0.4469%, much lower than that reported by due to difference in feeding conditions, diet, and animal species. Were there other @sm$ nitrate @/sm$-reducing bacteria present in the rumen? In nature, most @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reducers are found in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria. Based on deep analysis of sequencing data, we found that Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were linearly/quadratically increased with @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ addition. On genus taxon, Campylobacter of Proteobacteria was linearly increased with @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ supplementation. We proposed that there are undiscovered @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reducing bacteria in Proteobacteria (especially Campylobacter genus) and Cyanobacteria phyla.	2
@sm$ Nitric oxide @/sm$ was also shown to kill @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ in vitro. When applied therapeutically, phenytoin powder did not kill @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ but promoted healing through acceleration of fibrogenesis.	3
@sm$ Octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside @/sm$ prevented the expression of cell-associated fructosyltransferase activity in @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ ATCC 25975 grown in batch culture or incubated in nonproliferating cell suspension medium. This effect was not due to the direct inhibition of enzyme activity nor due to the loss of active enzyme into the external medium. The prevention of enzyme expression did not appear to be due to the inhibition of a general translocation mechanism for protein secretion, since fructosyltransferase activity was not detected within the cytoplasm of lysed cells grown in the presence of @sm$ octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside @/sm$; nor was there any observed inhibition of the secretion of the extracellular enzyme glucosyltransferase.	3
@sm$ Oleanolic acid @/sm$ (148) often occurs in combination with its isomer, ursolic acid (147), and has been isolated from more than 1,620 plant species, especially in plants belonging to the Oleaceae family. @sm$ Oleanolic acid @/sm$ demonstrated moderate to high growth inhibitory activity against E. faecalis, @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, B. cereus, and M. tuberculosis. Derivatives of @sm$ oleanolic acid @/sm$ with antibacterial activity have been isolated from a variety of plant species; this is the case of compound 156 (3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyloleanolic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester) and compound 154 (3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-oleanolic acid), both isolated from Melanthera elliptica O.Hoffm. Compounds 156 and 154 showed moderate activity against multidrug-resistant E. coli, S. flexneri and S. aureus. Compound 155 (3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1 6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloleanolic acid) is another derivative of @sm$ oleanolic acid @/sm$ and was isolated from Paullinia pinnata L. (Sapindaceae). Compound 155 showed moderate to high antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, and S. enterica ser. Typhi. A set of oleanolic acid C-28 amide derivatives were synthesized and it was shown that a longer chain length improved antibacterial activity on gram-positive bacteria. Unlike ursolic acid, @sm$ oleanolic acid @/sm$ inhibits peptidoglycan turnover, thus affecting the cell membrane of bacteria. @sm$ Oleanolic acid @/sm$ also showed a synergistic effect in combination with conventional antibiotics against MRSA. Although @sm$ oleanolic acid @/sm$ is one of the most investigated plant-derived compounds and has been approved as an OTC hepatoprotective drug in China, few in vivo studies and clinical trials have been undertaken to evaluate the use of @sm$ oleanolic acid @/sm$ and its derivatives as antibacterial agents.	3
@sm$ Oligonucleotide @/sm$ probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16S rRNAs of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: Streptococcus spp., @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Enterobacteriaceae family.	0
@sm$ PMA @/sm$-activated THP-1 cells were treated in RPMI +/- (lacking FBS) with compounds of interest and incubated for 15 or 30 min at 37 C as indicated, on 384-well tissue-culture treated plates. All conditions were performed in replicates of eight. Cells were inoculated with FITC- or JX90a-labeled @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ (FLUORC.	3
@sm$ Piperacillin @/sm$ has the broadest activity spectrum of all the penicillins, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-negative rods, and anaerobes. To demonstrate its efficacy, a study examined the clinical usefulness of @sm$ piperacillin @/sm$ therapy compared to ampicillin-sulbactam for community-acquired pneumonia. The general clinical efficiency of @sm$ piperacillin @/sm$ therapy in these patients was similar to that of ampicillin-sulbactam therapy. The previous study by Seki et al. concluded that @sm$ piperacillin @/sm$ was effective in the treatment of pneumonia and proposed @sm$ piperacillin @/sm$ as a first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. From the results of our study, @sm$ piperacillin @/sm$ cannot be recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with pneumonia caused by @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ species because of its relatively high resistance rate and lower sensitivity rate according to our susceptibility testing results.	4
@sm$ Polyphosphate @/sm$ [poly(P)] has antibacterial activity against various Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria are generally resistant to poly(P). Here, we describe the antibacterial characterization of poly(P) against a Gram-negative periodontopathogen, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$. The MICs of pyrophosphate (Na(4)P(2)O(7)) and all poly(P) (Na(n + 2)P(n)O(3n + 1); n = 3 to 75) tested for the bacterium by the agar dilution method were 0.24% and 0.06%, respectively. Orthophosphate (Na(2)HPO(4)) failed to inhibit bacterial growth. Poly-P75 was chosen for further study. In liquid medium, 0.03% poly-P75 was bactericidal against @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ irrespective of the growth phase and inoculum size, ranging from 10(5) to 10(9) cells/ml. UV-visible spectra of the pigments from @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ grown on blood agar with or without poly-P75 showed that poly-P75 reduced the formation of mu-oxo bisheme by the bacterium. Poly-P75 increased hemin accumulation on the @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ surface and decreased energy-driven uptake of hemin by the bacterium. The expression of the genes encoding hemagglutinins, gingipains, hemin uptake loci, chromosome replication, and energy production was downregulated, while that of the genes related to iron storage and oxidative stress was upregulated by poly-P75. The transmission electron microscope showed morphologically atypical cells with electron-dense granules and condensed nucleoid in the cytoplasm. Collectively, poly(P) is bactericidal against @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$, in which hemin/heme utilization is disturbed and oxidative stress is increased by poly(P).	4
@sm$ Polysaccharide @/sm$-containing bacteria possess degradation properties, and their associations with fecal sugar derivatives were generally positive, while @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ showed a negative correlation. Dorea strain administration on a high-fat diet mice intensified insulin resistance and obesity compared with @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ administration. The authors of this work reported that the gut microbes' effects on metabolic diseases are mediated through @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$' microbial fermentation and their derivatives. Several studies in mice involving species of Bacteroides have shown that controlling the intake of @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ in the mouse diet allows species selection that are capable of metabolizing the complex @sm$ glycans @/sm$ present, such as human milk oligosaccharides, fructans, fucosylated mucin glycans and mannan, among others.	2
@sm$ Progesterone @/sm$ displayed the greatest ability in the induction of biofilm formation (65%) but had a smaller effect on @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ ATCC 13884 bacterial population growth (11%). Similarly, hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic widely used in combination with antihypertensive drugs, had a great effect on the induction of biofilm formation (51%) and a smaller effect on bacterial growth (17%). Acetaminophen caused several changes in @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ ATCC 13884 cultures related to quorum sensing, such as inducing the synthesis of the N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (C6-AHL) autoinducer by up 22%, increasing bacterial populations by 27%, inducing biofilm formation by 49%, and forming a more gentamicin-resistant biofilm. Furthermore, it increased the colonization area of the urethral catheter. Non-modified drugs are mainly excreted in the feces and urine at concentrations of approximately 0.09-0.6 microg/mL. Therefore, intact drugs at low concentrations in urine might be enough to activate the virulence and resistance mechanisms of @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ ATCC 13884.	3
@sm$ ROS @/sm$, RNS, and NO produced by cold plasma play a key role in the inactivation of microorganisms and the formation of nitrite in meat products. As a food additive, nitrite is often used to pickle meat products and prevent the contamination of pathogenic microorganisms, such as @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens. Cold plasma technology is used in the research, at present, to pickle pork sausages because cold plasma-producing @sm$ ROS @/sm$ may directly result in microbial death by destroying microbial DNA; on the other hand, nitrite formed by cold plasma treatment can maintain the color, flavor, and lipid oxidation of pork.	3
@sm$ Reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$) have been associated with host defense, inflammation, and tissue damage. Antioxidant enzymes participate in inactivation of @sm$ ROS @/sm$ and degradation of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide. In the current study, the CBN group significantly increased the inhibition ability of hydroxyl radical and GSH-PX activity and modestly decreased H2O2 serum concentration. This was in agreement with previous studies, which showed that diets with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ can increase the activity of GSH-PX, SOD, and CAT in intestine of broiler and Rex rabbits. In addition, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$'s main metabolite butyric acid can modulate oxidative damage by reducing @sm$ ROS @/sm$ and increasing the levels of antioxidative enzymes. Improved immune function might partially contribute to enhance the antioxidant ability and suppress @sm$ ROS @/sm$ production, because @sm$ ROS @/sm$ are considered indispensable for host defense against an inflammatory threat. ALT, AST, ALP, gamma-GT, and CHE play an important role in liver function as main indicators. A previous study revealed that @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ supplementation resulted in a considerable reduction in the serum ALT and AST activities in piglets. In the mice model, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ also relieved acute liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride. Our results indicated that diet supplemented with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ decreased AST, ALP, gamma-GT, and CHE activies, particularly in the CBN group.	1
@sm$ Rifampin @/sm$ inhibited 20 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in concentrations of 0.005 to 0.02 mug/ml in 7H-9 broth with Tween 80 and killed all or nearly all of the inoculum in four to eight times greater concentrations. In the same medium without Tween 80, as well as on 7H-10 agar, about 16 to 64 times these amounts were required to produce the same effect. @sm$ Rifampin @/sm$ was also active against @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ and some of the nonchromogenic mycobacteria. The incidence of mycobacterial cells resistant to @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ within the cultures studied was in the range of one to four per 10(8) to 10(9) colony-forming units with concentrations of 4 to 125 mug of @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ per ml. Only one of the Battey cultures and that of M. fortuitum yielded cells resistant to @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ at 125 mug/ml but not at 500 mug/ml. The same strains yielded more than double that number of organisms resistant to streptomycin and up to 100 times more organisms resistant to isoniazid. All three drugs stopped the growth or reduced the mycobacterial population in growing cultures after contact for 24 to 48 hr. Complete inhibition of growth was produced by @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ at 1.0 mug/ml in an average of 6 days and by streptomycin at 5.0 mug/ml in 3 days. After an average contact of 10.7 days with @sm$ rifampin @/sm$, five of seven strains resumed growth and all strains began regrowth after exposure to streptomycin for 9.4 days. The marked susceptibility of M. tuberculosis and of atypical mycobacteria to @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ in vitro and the relatively low incidence of resistant mutants suggests that this agent may have clinical usefulness in the treatment of tuberculosis and some other mycobacterioses.	4
@sm$ Spermidine @/sm$ was produced by all strains from the genera Bifidobacterium, by two of the three Clostridium isolates (B.1 and B.2), but by only two of the 17 Enterococcus strains (C.1 and C.17). Lactobacillus crispatus and @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ strains were not able to produce @sm$ spermidine @/sm$, but Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius (except D.21) and Lactobacillus vaginalis were capable of producing @sm$ spermidine @/sm$ (Figure 1). The Pediococcus and Streptococcus isolates also secreted @sm$ spermidine @/sm$ (Figure 1). For Gram-negative bacteria, only two E. coli strains (H.7 and H.8), one K. pneumoniae strain (I.2) and Proteus mirabilis (K.1) were capable of secreting @sm$ spermidine @/sm$ under these culture conditions (Figure 1).	0
@sm$ Tedizolid @/sm$'s anaerobic activity is unappreciated. In this study, it was active against all 332 anaerobic isolates tested at <=2 mug/ml except @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ and was more active than linezolid against Bacteroides fragilis group species (MIC90, 1 mug/ml versus 2 to 4 mug/ml). @sm$ Tedizolid @/sm$ was active against Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC90 for clostridia, 0.25 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90 for anaerobic cocci, <=0.06 to 0.25 mug/ml).	3
@sm$ Terpenoids @/sm$ represent the largest group of secondary metabolites with variable structures and functions. @sm$ Terpenoids @/sm$ are well known for their beneficial application in human life, such as pharmaceutical products, vitamins, hormones, anticancer drugs, cosmetics, flavors and fragrances, foods, agriculture, and biofuels. Recently, engineering microbial cells have been provided with a sustainable approach to produce @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ with high yields. Noticeably, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system has emerged as one of the most efficient genome-editing technologies to engineer microorganisms for improving @sm$ terpenoid @/sm$ production. In this review, we summarize the application of the CRISPR-Cas system for the production of @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ in microbial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$. CRISPR-Cas9 deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-based CRISPR (CRISPRi), and the dCas9-based activator (CRISPRa) have been used in either individual or combinatorial systems to control the metabolic flux for enhancing the production of @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$. Finally, the prospects of using the CRISPR-Cas system in @sm$ terpenoid @/sm$ production are also discussed.	1
@sm$ Tirapazamine @/sm$ (@sm$ 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4 dioxide @/sm$) is an anticancer agent showing selective cytotoxicity for hypoxic cells in solid tumors. Upon its activation, this aziridinylquinone forms a free radical at position 1, where the oxide group is attached, inducing single- and double-strand breaks in DNA, base damage, and cell death. Previous studies reported its activity against E. coli, Salmonella enterica, S. aureus, @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$, and M. tuberculosis. In the present study, for the first time, we observed the effectiveness of @sm$ tirapazamine @/sm$ against P.	3
@sm$ Tryptamine @/sm$ was noted in one of the RYGB donors when cultured with tryptophan-supplemented media (Figure S7). Twelve representative bacterial species in healthy individuals (Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus), obese patients (Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Ruminococcus torques and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$) and RYGB patients/animal models (Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca) were selected for batch culture.	0
@sm$ Tryptophan @/sm$ catabolism in cancer is recognized as an important microenvironment modulator that alleviates antitumor immune responses. It has been reported that cancer cells create an immunosuppressive milieu in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes by inducing T cell anergy and apoptosis through depletion of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ and accumulation of immunosuppressive @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ catabolites. In our study, fecal @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ was significantly increased in CRC patients. It has been reported that the fecal tryptophan indole pathway is impaired in colorectal cancer and that indole-related bacteria may lead to downregulation of the tryptophan indole metabolic pathway. We noticed a linkage of increased levels of fecal @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ associated with @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$ and Fusobacterium in our study for decreased production of indole.	2
@sm$ Tyramine @/sm$ is a health-adverse biogenic amine, which can accumulate in fermented foods like cheese by decarboxylation of the free amino acid tyrosine by either starter cultures or resident microbes such as lactic acid bacteria including Enterococcus spp., respectively. Our study aimed to show the effect of sodium chloride concentrations on @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ production as well as to characterise bacterial strains as anti-@sm$ tyramine @/sm$ biocontrol agents in a 2 mL micro-cheese fermentation model. The effect of sodium chloride on @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ production was assayed with @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ producing strains from eight different species or subspecies. Generally, an increase in sodium chloride concentration enhanced @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ production, e.g. from 0% to 1.5% of sodium chloride resulted in an increase of @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ of 870% with a @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ strain. In the biocontrol screening among lactic acid bacteria, a Lactobacillus plantarum JA-1199 strain was screened that could consume in successful competition with other resident bacteria tyrosine in the micro-cheese model as a source of energy gain. Thereby @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ accumulation was reduced between 4% to 99%. The results of this study disclose a feasible strategy for decreasing @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ concentration and increasing the safety level of fermented food.	2
@sm$ Tyramine @/sm$, histamine, phenylethylamine, tryptamine, putrescine, cadaverine, spermine and spermidine have been detected in a large number of analyzed products. That being said, @sm$ tyramine @/sm$, putrescine and cadaverine are the main determined biogenic amines in fermented sausages. While the presence of putrescine and @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ in fermented sausages is associated with the activity of lactic acid bacteria, it is stated that cadaverine is caused by insufficient hygienic measures and high microbial load of the raw material used in production. Although the aminogenic potential of lactic acid bacteria is low, it can contribute to biogenic amine accumulation. Some lactic acid bacteria have amino acid decarboxylase activity and can form histamine, cadaverine and putrescine, while they are particularly effective in terms of @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ formation. Therefore, the selection of strains used as starter cultures in fermented sausages is very important. On the other hand, lactic acid bacteria are considered microorganisms that are responsible for the formation of biogenic amines in fermented meat products. A high @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ number is reported to have a significant impact on histamine formation. While @sm$ tyramine @/sm$-producing strains have been attributed to Carnobacterium, Latilactobacillus curvatus, and L. plantarum, Micrococcaceae and Latilactobacillus sake have been reported to play no role in @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ formation. It is stated that Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium species, which belong to the lactic acid bacteria group, also produce high levels of @sm$ tyramine @/sm$. L. curvatus strains are reported to play a role in the formation of phenylethylamine, tryptamine, putrescine and cadaverine as well as @sm$ tyramine @/sm$.	1
@sm$ Vinblastine @/sm$ has the ability to react with microtubules, crystallizing them into helical structures and addition of @sm$ vinblastine @/sm$ has been shown to inhibit the invasion of intestine-derived epithelial cells (INT407) by @gm$ Enterobacter sakazakii @/gm$. Here, @sm$ vinblastine @/sm$ similarly hindered Y.	3
@sm$ Vitamin B7 @/sm$ acts as a coenzyme for several biochemical reactions, such as glycolysis and cell signalling and epigenetic regulations. It also controls gene expression, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), through histone binding mechanism, commonly known as biotinylation. Therefore, this vitamin may also have anti-inflammatory effects. @sm$ Biotin @/sm$ is primarily synthesized from either malonyl CoA or pimeloyl-CoA. Enzymes of the @sm$ biotin @/sm$ biosynthesis pathway are overrepresented in enterotype 1, enriched in Bacteroides. Bacteria that can produce @sm$ vitamin B7 @/sm$ include Bacteroides fragilis, @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$, Fusobacterium varium, and Campylobacter coli. In contrast, others are extensive @sm$ vitamin B7 @/sm$ reducers, such as Lactobacillus murinus.	1
@sm$ Vitamin D @/sm$ supplementation alters the composition and richness of the intestinal microflora by decreasing Veillonellaceae and Oscillospiraceae, while increasing beneficial bacteria such Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria. Vitamin A dramatically raised Bacteroides/bacteroidetes ratio. Vitamin A deficiency increased Enterococci, while its addition increased @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in mice's intestines, affecting early viral infection. Vitamin C also helps the organism fight infection and eliminate risky microorganisms. @sm$ Vitamin D @/sm$ intake decreases Veillonellaceae and Oscillospiraceae and increases Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria in the gut microbiota.	3
A 2.00 w/v gamma-PGA solution had 11 mm and 13 mm inhibition zones against Staphylococcus aureus and @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$, respectively. A second order polynomial equation for prediction of gamma-PGA was derived as: gammaPGA yield = 3316.061 - 449.708A + 9.036A2 - 139.813B + 3.095B2 - 7.699C - 0.164C2 + 13.116AB - 0.087AB2 - 0.248A2B + 3.781AC - 0.076A2C - 0.394BC. It showed an increase in gamma-PGA yield with increasing L-glutamic acid and @sm$ biotin @/sm$, but a decrease with yeast extract.	2
A @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ genus-specific PCR primer pair was designed and used as a positive control for the PCR assay of the differentiating regions. This primer pair was screened against all sequences from all organisms currently deposited in the GenBank Database, and is expected to be extremely @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ specific. Each set of PCR reactions also contained a no DNA contamination control. The PCR was performed on @sm$ methanol @/sm$ killed bacterial cells, which is a commonly used diagnostic technique.	3
A @sm$ PBS @/sm$ negative control was set up and incubated for two hours at 37  C and 150 rpm, while the @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ suspensions were cultured in LB broth until an OD595 value of 0.5 was reached. EGCG (1%) was then added to the bacterial suspension. After centrifuging the mixture at 8000 rpm for two minutes, the precipitate was retained and gently washed twice with @sm$ PBS @/sm$. Then, the bacterial solution was re-suspended by adding 5 mL of @sm$ PBS @/sm$.	3
A @sm$ glucosamine @/sm$ residue was nonstoichiometrically linked to the branching galacturonic acid, and more interestingly, a Ko unit substitutes in part the terminal Kdo residue. The presence of the Ko residue is not frequent in core structures, and to date it has been described as a substitute for Kdo in the LPS of Yersinia, Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, Serratia. Finally, this new core oligosaccharide confirmed the lack of a uniform core structure for the unique species of the @gm$ Plesiomonas @/gm$ genus.	1
A DndD homolog in @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$, SpfD, has ATPase activity possibly related to DNA structure alteration or nicking during @sm$ PT @/sm$ incorporation.	1
A Superfrost Plus  slide (Menzel-Glaser, Germany) was heat fixated and stored at room temperature until shipment to the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium (ITM) where it was re-fixated with a Carnoy solution (6:3:1, ethanol:@sm$ chloroform @/sm$:glacial acetic acid) for at least 12 h. For all participants who had @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ detected by qPCR, the slide was examined using Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-FISH employing species-specific probes for A. vaginae (AtoITM1) and @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ (Gard162), and the broad-range BacUni-1 probe.	0
A bacterial strain isolated from human faeces, M-165T, was characterized in terms of its phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ profile, menaquinone profile and phylogenetic position (based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis). A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolate was a member of the genus Parabacteroides. Strain M-165T was closely related to @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ strains, showing 98 % sequence similarity. The strain was obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, Gram-negative, rod-shaped and was able to grow on media containing 20 % bile. Although the phenotypic characteristics of the strain M-165T were similar to those of @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$, the isolate could be differentiated from @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ by means of API 20A tests for L-arabinose and L-rhamnose fermentation. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of the novel strain with respect to @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ JCM 9497T (<or=60 % DNA-DNA relatedness).	0
A cholesterol-rich station in the membrane known as a @sm$ lipid @/sm$ raft is formed when cholesterol is present in membranes with pre-determined membrane dynamics. These @sm$ lipid @/sm$ rafts are intended to serve as a gateway for the entry of numerous pathogens. Pathogens can elude the immune system in an innovative way by using membrane microdomains. Some pathogens have acquired strategies to thwart innate and adaptive immune responses by co-opting raft-associated pathways. Most intracellular pathogens tactically exploit @sm$ lipid @/sm$ rafts for entering the host cell. Salmonella and Shigella have a common requirement for a T3SS (type III secretion system), which is a multicomponent molecular syringe that allows the translocation of so called effector proteins from bacterial cytoplasm, through the inner and outer bacterial membrane, as well as the host plasma membrane, directly into cytoplasm. It has effector proteins called SipB and SipC for Salmonella and IpaB and IpaC for Shigella that must come into contact with the host cell in order to activate the system. The binding of SipB/IpaB to host cells requires cholesterol in the membranes on the downstream of the T3SS activation. The pathogenic vesicles of Enterotoxigenic E. coli fuses to the cell membrane in the cholesterol rich domain of the host cell membrane. Cholesterol depleting agents reduces internalization of Helicobacter pylori in gut epithelial cells. Hole forming bacteria like @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ prefers to create holes in the @sm$ lipid @/sm$ rafts as rafts can sustain the holes for longer time.	3
A closer comparative analysis was performed for the presence/absence of functions involved in biocontrol and the interactions of @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ strains with plants and the environment. Biological control mechanisms include synthesis of secondary metabolites against bacterial and fungal pathogens, including toxins and bacteriocins. The UM270 genome contains biosynthetic genes for multiple secondary metabolites, such as 2,4-DAPG, phenazines and @sm$ HCN @/sm$; the rest of genomes contained only one or two of these functions.	1
A cohort study with 153 Italian individuals following different diets showed that adherence to the MD correlates to higher fecal levels of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and butyrate. Accordingly, MD has been associated with increased abundance of butyrate-producing strains like F. prausnitzii and E. rectale and the butyrate-producing genus @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and to reduced levels of circulating LPS.	1
A common feature for all co-cultures is the decrease of a metabolite, which might be @sm$ L-Arginine @/sm$ (metabolite no 1). This could be related to an increased uptake by @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$, since it was reported that @sm$ arginine @/sm$ leads to increased growth in @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$. Another consistently decreased metabolite in co-cultures is metabolite no. 2, which we could putatively identify as 12alpha-Hydroxyamoorstatin, which is a rare metabolite but linked to the bile acid structure and thus is potentially indicating to an increased transformation of bile acids by @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$. In contrast, there is also one metabolite that is consistently increased in co-culture, which could be identified as L-ornithine (metabolite no. 3). L-Ornithine is involved in the synthesis of @sm$ arginine @/sm$ and an increased uptake of @sm$ arginine @/sm$ might result in a decrease of ornithine produced and secreted by @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$. Interestingly, we detected metabolites significantly altered in abundance between the co-culturing with @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ and single culturing for A.	2
A comparison between control mice and all antidepressant groups together revealed that Ruminococcus, @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ and an undefined genus in the order RF32, class Alphaproteobacteria were less abundant in antidepressant treated mice (Fig. 2a, b). When analyzing the effects of each individual antidepressant in comparison to control using pairwise comparisons, the same genera were shown to be less abundant in @sm$ escitalopram @/sm$, venlafaxine, duloxetine and desipramine groups, but not in fluoxetine group (Supplemental Figure S2). Further, in both the overall effects of antidepressants and in the pairwise analysis, the differences in genus @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ contributed to observed decreased abundance of family Coriobacteriaceae, order Coriobacteriales, class Coriobacteriia, phylum Actinobacteria in antidepressant groups (Fig. 2a, b; Supplemental Figure S2). In addition to the LEfSe analysis, we further analyzed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data with PERMANOVA (Supplementary Table 2). At the genus level, both Ruminococcus and @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ were effected by antidepressant treatment (p < 0.05), although only @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ remained significant after corrections for multiple comparisons. In direct pairwise analysis between control and each of the antidepressant groups, some antidepressants significantly decreased levels of Ruminococcus, although they were no longer significant after corrections for multiple comparisons. Therefore, the findings of decrease in Ruminococcus and @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ were more significant in the LEfSe analysis, and we further explored these findings using qRT-PCR.	3
A compelling example of extensive AA-dependent metabolic communication between host and pathogen occurs during infection with @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ or Shigella (Figure 1). Those infections rapidly induce a state of AA starvation in epithelial cells, which reduces abundances of leucine/@sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ in cytosol, and inhibits activation of mTORC1, but induces the general control nonderepressible 2-dependent stress response pathway to promote expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) (Figure 1). This starvation is induced through aseptic membrane damage, but not protein metabolism because chloramphenicol has little effect on the expression of ATF3 while inhibiting synthesis of bacterial proteins. AA starvation may inhibit the host's innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses against pathogens, but activate host cell autophagy responses which are normally inhibited by mTORC1 (Figure 1). Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that triggers nutrient recycling to sustain essential metabolic functions during nutrient or energy deprivation. Autophagy involves degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, such as dysfunctional organelles or macromolecular complexes. Autophagy also promotes targeting and degradation of intracellular bacteria, such as Shigella or @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, and has important roles in the pathogenesis of extracellular bacterial infections, such as ETEC. However, @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ could escape from autophagy-mediated degradation through the replenishment of intracellular AA pools to recruit and reactivate mTORC1 signaling at the surface of the @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-containing vacuole (SCV) (Figure 1).	2
A creatine chromogenic solution was added to @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ cultured in a V-P selective medium for 48 h. Results showed that the fermentation broth containing @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ turned pink after the addition of the creatine chromogenic solution, while no colour change was observed in the culture medium of the blank control group (Fig. 1F), indicating that @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ can produce @sm$ acetoin @/sm$. Using different concentrations of @sm$ acetoin @/sm$ standard solution from the colour reaction to draw the standard curve, the @sm$ acetoin @/sm$ production capacity of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ was 152.88 +- 13.56 mg L-1.	1
A decrease in the relative content of short-chain, medium-and long-chain acids and their derivatives, as well as @sm$ indole @/sm$, was noted in the bacterial media without OMVs. According to the obtained media analysis data, it can be indirectly concluded that @sm$ indole @/sm$ is contained in vesicles of at least five analyzed species, including @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ 807, Bacteroides salyersiae 2697, Bacteroides xylanisolvens Pik, Bacteroides eggerthii 91 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens EBA 5-17.	1
A decreased ratio of cholic acid (CA)/@sm$ chenodeoxycholic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ CDCA @/sm$) in infants with CJ indicated a shift in BA synthesis from the primary pathway to the alternative BA synthesis pathway. The bacterial taxa enriched in infants with CJ corresponded to the genera Clostridium, Gemella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella and the family Enterobacteriaceae and were negatively correlated with the fecal BA level and the @sm$ CDCA @/sm$/CA ratio but positively correlated with the serological indexes of impaired liver function. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid (DCA)/CA was observed in a proportion of infants with CJ. The bacteria depleted in infants with CJ, including Bifidobacterium and @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, were positively and negatively correlated with the fecal levels of BAs and the serological markers of impaired liver function, respectively.	3
A distinct archaeal group (the Rumen Cluster C; RCC) was subsequently identified as being putatively able to convert methyl compounds including TMA and @sm$ methylamines @/sm$ into methane. Half the human subjects examined to date also produce methane, usually by harboring the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii, or less frequently, @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ (reviewed in ref.).	2
A distinctive ' @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ ' odour is produced. On mCCDA agar, colonies are small and grey with irregular margins. Isolates will grow microaerobically (without hydrogen) at 42  C, but growth was faster at 37  C. They grow anaerobically at 37  C but do not grow in ambient air at 37  C. They grow on nutrient agar, nutrient agar +1 % w/v @sm$ glycine @/sm$ and nutrient agar +2 % w/v NaCl, but not on MacConkey agar or on nutrient agar with 0.1 % w/v selenite.	2
A farrow-to-finish piggery that had recent problems related to @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infections was selected. Thirty 8-wk-old pigs and 10 farrowing sows were sampled by tonsillar brushing using a sterile tooth brush. Immediately after sampling, the tooth brushes were transported on ice to the laboratory in 15 mL of Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid) with 0.25% @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ selective supplement SR0126 (Oxoid) and 0.2 mg/mL of @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$.	3
A group of 450 heifers, 13 to 15 mo of age, were individually identified, vaccinated (IBR, PI(3), Leptospira, @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$), examined (body condition score, reproductive tract evaluation, assessment of vaginal lesions), and cultured for U. diversum . Heifers were randomly allocated to either a treated group given @sm$ chlortetracycline @/sm$ (approximately 350 mg/hd/d for 30 d in a grain crumble) or a nontreated control group. Prebreeding, most heifers showed signs of vulvovaginitis, 44% cultured positive for U. diversum . Significant associations were found between the severity of vaginal lesions and ovarian activity (P < 0.05), and between BCS and ovarian activity (P < 0.02). The U. diversum vaginal culture (positive or negative) showed no significant association with BCS, severity of vaginal lesions, or ovarian activity (all were P > 0.5). At pregnancy examination (35 d following conclusion of a 61-d breeding season), treated compared with nontreated heifers showed 1) a slight but not significant (P > 0.25) decrease in vaginal colonization by U. diversum (46 to 34% and 41 to 37%, respectively); 2) an association between increased severity of vaginal lesions and increasing pregnancy rate, especially in treated heifers; and 3) an increased pregnancy rate (72 and 57%, respectively; P < 0.01). Prebreeding treatment with @sm$ chlortetracycline @/sm$ appeared to improve pregnancy rates in beef heifers with endemic U.	3
A high abundance of the genus Dialister (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] effect size: 3.97856, p=0.004), species Peptoniphilus lacrimalis (LDA effect size: 4.00551, p=0.020), and @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$ (LDA effect size: 4.00885, p=0.007) was associated with a good prognosis. Starch, sucrose, and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ metabolism was highly activated in the gut microbiota of the poor prognosis group.	2
A high average MDR level was recorded among @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ spp.(90.9%,), Citrobacter spp.(90.0%), Acinetobacter spp.(88.9%), K. pneumoniae (82.9%)and E. coli (69.6%). While Pseudomonas spp. showed a 100% MDR level, no MDR was found in the K. oxytoca and K. ozaenae isolates. The most effective antibiotics for MDR Gram negative bacilli were amikacin (97.1%), meropenem (96.3%), and @sm$ imipenem @/sm$ (95.5%) (Table 3).	3
A high proportion of the proteins that were equally abundant in both samples were from common gut bacteria, such as Bacteroides, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and Clostridium. These included proteins involved in translation, @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism and energy production. In another study, two human fecal samples were analyzed and the functions of the identified proteins were predicted (Rooijers et al.,). The most abundantly present COGs were involved in translation, energy production, and conversion as well as @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ transport and metabolism, which supports the findings of studies linking the microbiota with @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism (Kovatcheva-Datchary et al.,). The study also pointed out the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, the only intestinal member of the Verrucomicrobia, within the microbiota and showed that most of the proteins produced by these bacteria are involved in @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ transport and metabolism as well as amino acid transport and metabolism.	2
A highly active phospholipase D that is specific for cardiolipin was detected in the gram-negative bacterium @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$. Previously reported phospholipase D preparations have come exclusively from higher plants. The bacterial enzyme hydrolyzed cardiolipin to phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidic acid. During the incubation, phosphatidic acid disappeared. @sm$ Phosphatidyl ethanolamine @/sm$, methylated phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl choline, and phosphatidyl glycerol were not hydrolyzed when cardiolipin was rapidly hydrolyzed.	2
A huge impact of bacterial diseases on fish productivity and the role of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ in fish infections due to multiple virulence factors has been previously reported. In this study, all the strains isolated from water samples of small fish farms were found to be beta-haemolytic and proteolytic. This supports the theory of close association between the two factors since proteases have a prominent role in cleavage and activation of haemolysin. Additionally, 70.6% of the strains produced amylase whereas lesser isolates produced siderophore and DNase. Lower detection of siderophore-producing bacteria in this study may be due to alternate @sm$ iron @/sm$ acquisition mechanisms found in @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ for utilization in the process of host colonization.	2
A later study reported a 5-fold increase in @sm$ carbon @/sm$ flux through Pdh using this NADH insensitive mutant under anaerobic condition when compared to wild-type. Expression of this mutant Pdh has also aided the production of butanol by 1.6-fold. Similarly, expression of a mutant Pdh homologue from @gm$ Klebsiella pneumonia @/gm$ led to a 2-fold increase in 1,4-butanediol production under anaerobic conditions.	1
A loop of fresh culture of the strain @gm$ L.citreum @/gm$ BD1707 grown on M17 agar was inoculated into 100-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 mL of sterile M17 broth and cultivated at 30  C on a rotary shaker (Model I2400, New Brunswick Scientific Inc., Edison, NJ, U.S.) at 200 rpm for 24 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 5 min at 4  C and washed twice with sterile buffered physical @sm$ saline @/sm$. Subsequently, the washed cells were suspended in initial volume of buffered physical @sm$ saline @/sm$ (9.2 log10 cfu/mL) and inoculated at a 2% (v/v) ratio into 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of sterilized TJSM supplemented with varying levels of sucrose (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 g/L) at different initial pH values (4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 or 8.5).	3
A low amount (around 1 mM) of monosaccharides, including @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and galactose, were detected in the supernatant throughout the course of fermentation. B. thetaiotaomicron produced acetate, propionate, succinate, and lactate, as well as a low amount of malate from lactose and total HM carbohydrate fermentation. The co-culture of B. thetaiotaomicron with @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ showed a rapid consumption of lactose with complete depletion within 24 h. Up to 3 mM of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and galactose were detected in the supernatant of co-cultures after the first 12 h of fermentation. The major metabolites in the co-cultures were propionate, succinate, acetate, butyrate, and formate. Butyrate, the signature product of @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$, was produced at 11.85 +- 0.32 mM in lactose and 12.23 +- 1.80 mM in total HM carbohydrates.	2
A medium containing 0.50 g of thiotone peptone, 0.30 g of soluble @sm$ starch @/sm$, 0.02 g of MgSO4 X 7H2O, 0.90 g of Na2HPO4 X 2H2O, 100.00 ml of distilled water, and optionally , 166 micrograms of dichloridric thiamine supported sporulation of 138 out of 141 @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ strains.	2
A mixed population of bacteria from industrial nitrogen wastewaters was incubated in continuous culture in medium containing 1000-1300 mg nitrate nitrogen per litre and maltose as a source of organic @sm$ carbon @/sm$. Maximal efficiency of denitrification was 8.6 mg N/1/h. The participation of denitrifying bacteria in the culture varied from 0% to about 80%, depending on the ratio of maltose concentration (CM) to nitrogen concentration (CN) in the medium. The optimal CM/CN ratio ensuring the greatest selection of denitrifying bacteria was 5.0, which calculated per organic @sm$ carbon @/sm$ (CC/CN) gave the value of 2.1. The amount of maltose needed to denitrify a defined amount of nitrogens was negatively correlated (rxy = -0.95) with the frequency of denitrifying bacteria (XD) in the culture and was: CM = (4.20-0.026XD)CN. The denitrifying bacteria isolated from the studied continuous culture were dominated by Alcaligenes faecalis and @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$.	2
A modified direct contact test was used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of four commercially available dental luting agents (RelyX Unicem, Ketac Cem, Ceramir Crown & Bridge and Harvard Cement) and two reference materials (glass-ionomer cement and calcium aluminate cement) compared to a negative-control material (@sm$ PMMA @/sm$). @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ bacteria were placed in direct contact with specimens that had been aged for 10 min, 1 day, and 7 days, in order to test the antibacterial properties of the materials. A metabolic assay containing resazurin was used to quantify the amount of viable bacteria remaining after the direct contact tests. The effects of pH and fluoride on bacteria proliferation were also evaluated. Strongest antibacterial properties were found for calcium aluminate cement, followed by Ceramir Crown & Bridge and RelyX Unicem. Ketac Cem, Harvard Cement, and the reference glass-ionomer cement showed bacteria content either higher than or not significantly different from the @sm$ PMMA @/sm$ control in all instances.	3
A more efficient in vitro method of kojibiose production employs a single sucrose phosphorylase obtained from @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$. This method produces maltose and kojibiose by transglycosylation of glucose and @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ (see Scheme 1 from).	1
A mouse model with T2DM-PTB was induced by administrations of @sm$ streptozotocin @/sm$, nicotinamide and @gm$ mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ (@gm$ Mtb @/gm$). A pSTAT3-specific inhibitor AG-490 was given into mice and then the lung injury in mice was observed. The molecules involved in AG-490-mediated events were screened out. Altered expression of miR-19b, miR-1281 and NFAT5 was introduced to identify their involvements and roles in lung injury and PTB severity in the mouse model. Consequently, pSTAT3 expression in mice with T2DM-associated PTB was increased. Down-regulation of pSTAT3 by AG-490 prolonged the lifetime of mice and improved the histopathologic conditions, and inhibited the fibrosis, inflammation, @gm$ Mtb @/gm$ content and number of apoptotic epithelial cells in mouse lung tissues.	3
A multi-species biofilm model was developed with three bacterial strains under laboratory conditions: Enterococcus faecalis ATTC 29212, Eikenella Corrodens ATTC 23834, @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ ATTC 33397. Lyophilized strains were rehydrated in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (Sigma aldrich, Sao Paulo, Brazil) enriched with @sm$ Hemin @/sm$ (Sigma aldrich, Sao Paulo, Brazil) (15 mg / L), in a anaerobic jar GasPack (BD, New York, USA) with Anaerocult A (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, USA).	2
A negative association was found between the intake of pectins and @sm$ flavanones @/sm$ from oranges and the levels of @gm$ Blautia coccoides @/gm$ and Clostridium leptum.	3
"A non-template control (PCR-grade @sm$ H2O @/sm$) and a positive control (isolated DNA from @gm$ ORT @/gm$ isolate confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ""MALDI-TOF"") were included in each run."	0
A notable example is the synthesis of the nucleoside of pharmaceutical interest @sm$ vidarabine @/sm$ (27), reported by Tamborini et al.. The nucleoside phosphorylases catalyzed the transfer of the sugar residue 25 to a second nucleobase, leading to the production of a new nucleoside upon transglycosylation reaction. The coupling of two nucleoside phosphorylases is often necessary when transglycosylation occurs between a purine and a pyrimidine base. Thereby, for the synthesis of @sm$ vidarabine @/sm$ (27), a bioreactor containing co-immobilized uridine phosphorylase from Clostridium perfringens (CpUP) and a purine nucleoside phosphorylase from @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ (AhPNP) was used (Scheme 13). The bioreactor was prepared by in-flow coimmobilization of CpUP and AhPNP on glyoxyl agarose and EziGTM. The operational stability for the EziGTM bioreactor was lower than that of the glyoxyl-agarose bioreactor. After 24 h of operation, an energy efficiency reduction of 10% was reported due to leaching of the enzyme. The continuous-flow synthesis of 27 was carried out at gram scale starting from 1 L of stock solution containing arabinofuranosyl uracil (araU, 25) as the sugar donor and adenine as the sugar acceptor (26), which flowed through the reactor with a residence time of 120 min at 28  C. The low solubility of @sm$ vidarabine @/sm$ (@sm$ araA @/sm$, 27) allowed it to be collected by precipitation in a cold vessel (4  C) outside the reactor upon filtration.	1
A number of 150 samples were prelevated from respiratory tract secretions of 88 patients with respiratory infections and three healthy subjects; 162 haemophilus strains were isolated, identified and studied and the following results were obtained: @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ was isolated from tonsillitis and laryngitis--over 70%, bronchitis--58% and pharyngitis--56.6%; H. influenzae was isolated from pharyngitis--26.4%, bronchitis--16.1% and tonsillitis--13.6% cases; H. parahaemolyticus from bronchitis--19.3%, tonsillitis--13.6% and laryngitis. H. paraphrophilus was isolated (6.8%) from pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis and pulmonary abscess and H. paraphrohaemolyticus was isolated--4.5% from pharyngitis, synusitis, bronchitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Most of the isolates belonged to biotype II H. influenzae and biotypes II, I, III @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$. Haemophils were 100% sensitive to Ofloxacin and resistant to Cro--13.5%, Do--17.9%, @sm$ C @/sm$ and Caz--22.2%, Aml--24.6%, Rd--40.7%, Amp--41.9% and Te--63.5%; varying according to the haemophilus species. H. influenzae was resistant to Do--14.2%, Caz and @sm$ C @/sm$--21.4%, @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ was resistant to Cro--11%, Do--22%, whilst H. parahaemolyticus was resistant to Do--9% and to Aml, Caz and Cro--13.6%. Haemophils isolated from sputum showed a resistance higher by 12-34% and 6-17% than those isolated from other specimens, such as pharyngeal exudate, where the resistance to rifadin was lower by 10%. beta-lactamases were present in 27.7% of the strains: @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$--36%, H. paraphrohaemolyticus--25%, H. influenzae--17.8% and H. parahaemolyticus--15.7%; in strains from sputum--34.2%, pharyngeal exudate--28.8% and from other specimens--6.6%. No correlations were noticed between the biotype and the clinical manifestation or the resistance to the antibiotic, a higher frequency of beta-lactamase production being reported in H. influenzae biotype V and @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ biotypes II and IV.	4
A number of antimicrobials, as well as heavy metals (e.g., arsenate, mercury, tellurite, copper, and chromate), may be tolerated by @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ C6, mainly facilitated by proteins involved in their efflux, transport, reduction, and functions encoded by antibiotic resistance genes, such as blaOXA-334 (OXA-211 family) and catB. In vitro assays revealed that @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ C6 was resistant to chloramphenicol, @sm$ trimethoprim @/sm$, cefoxitin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ C6 may produce secondary metabolites, and it harbors biosynthetic gene clusters for a siderophore, aryl polyene, bacteriocin, and unknown metabolites, based on predictions by antiSMASH.	4
A number of glycosyltransferases has been implicated in glycosylation of Fap1, a SRRP from an oral @gm$ streptococcus @/gm$, @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$. Glycosylation of Fap1 is initiated by transferring @sm$ GlcNAc @/sm$ residues to the Fap1 polypeptide by a two enzyme complex Gtf1 and Gtf2.	1
A pathway analysis focused on the @sm$ TCA @/sm$ cycle showed that the pathway components responsible for the conversion of pyruvate and citrate to oxaloacetate were up-regulated in HX130709a relative to HX130709. In contrast, components involved in the metabolism of succinate to fumarate were down-regulated. We hypothesize that the lower levels of medium-supplied carbohydrates were used by the attenuated @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$, but the cells compensated by up-regulating production of oxaloacetate and shunting excess oxaloacetate into the gluconeogenesis pathway. However, pathway components involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA were not changed. Combining this fact with the down-regulation of components involved in the metabolism of succinate to fumarate, we suggest that the @sm$ TCA @/sm$ cycle as a whole is down-regulated in HX130709a (Fig 4). Growth curves also showed that HX130709 grows more rapidly than HX130709a (Fig 5). Compared with HX130709, pyruvate levels in HX130709a may be slightly higher, but the difference is not significant (Fig 6). The colony morphology of HX130709a was convex and irregular, similar to that of HX130709. Electron microscopy showed capsule material as an electron-dense layer outside the outer membrane and no significant morphological difference between the virulent and attenuated strains (Fig 7), which is inconsistent with the result reported by Yoshihiro et al.. The role of the capsule in virulence has been clearly demonstrated using isogenic mutants with defined mutations. However, differences in growth curves and pyruvate metabolism between parent strains and their avirulent derivatives have not been reported, nor have differences in mRNA and protein levels. Our results demonstrate that capsule is not closely associated with virulence in @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$.	2
A pertinent example is the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ utilisation profile of strains of lactococcal species. This is particularly well-described for the dairy lactococcal species L. lactis and L. cremoris based on both genome sequence analysis and phenotypic characterisation and is, perhaps unsurprisingly, largely focused on lactose metabolism. Within these species, however, are strains that appear to have adapted broader @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ utilisation capabilities including L. lactis strain A12, which was isolated from sourdough (Passerini et al., ). Genome comparisons with the model L. lactis strain IL1403 identified unique gene content representing 23% of the L. lactis A12 genome. Phenotypic evaluation established that this strain was capable of metabolising various plant-derived @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ including cellobiose, arabinose, raffinose and trehalose while it is incapable of growth on lactose. Therefore, it is important to note that while the majority of L. lactis strains are dairy-associated, there are plant-derived isolates with highly distinct metabolic profiles, which is likely responsible for the observed genetic variability within this species. @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ strains are capable of fermenting alpha-galactosides including raffinose and melibiose and the resulting alpha-galactose is further degraded through either the tagatose 6-phosphate or the Leloir pathway (Boucher et al., ).	2
A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that Holdemanella biformis DSM 3989(T), Faecalicoccus pleomorphus ATCC 29734(T), @gm$ Faecalitalea cylindroides @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 27803 @/gm$(T), and Allobaculum stercoricanis DSM 13633(T) are closely related to the isolate (87.4, 87.3, 86.9 and 86.9 % sequence similarity), respectively. The major cellular @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ (>10 %) of the isolate were identified as C18:1 cis 9 FAME (36.9 %), C16:0 FAME (33.7 %) and C18:0 FAME (13.2 %).	1
A polarization circuit was employed using @sm$ platinum @/sm$ electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$, S.	0
A pre-clinical study showed that acai anthocyanin-rich extract (150 mg/Kg for 98 days) was effective in decreasing body weight, serum @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), total cholesterol, and LDL-c levels in C57BL/6J obese mice induced by a high-fat diet. Acai anthocyanin-rich extract supplementation reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and modulated intestinal microbiota composition, as indicated by decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and increased relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, which were alterations markedly induced by an HFD. Acai extract caused enrichment in Verrucomicrobia at the phylum level, Akkermansia and Sporosarcina at the genus level, and A. muciniphila at the species level. A. muciniphila abundance negatively correlated with serum @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ (TG), glucose, and insulin levels. @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ and Bacteroides acidifaciens negatively correlated with total cholesterol and LDL-c levels.	3
A previous study demonstrated that the Streptococcaceae dominant group, Pseudomonadaceae dominant group, Corynebacteriaceae dominant group, and Staphylococcaceae dominant group encoded enriched gene pathways, including ansamycin biosynthesis, @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolism, the two-component response system virulence pathway, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling pathway, respectively. These metabolites may be involved in the immune responses of nasal polyp tissues. Therefore, the effect of the metabolites of Lachnoclostridium and @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ on ILC2s in NP tissues should be further investigated.	1
A previous study that used the combination of Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus casei resulted in an increase in the daidzein content (from 1 to 7/100 g of sample dry weight) and @sm$ genistein @/sm$ (from 2 to 5/100 g of the dry weight sample). In another study, a combination of the same strains of B. lactis (BLC1) and L. casei (MB151) resulted in an increase in daidzein, @sm$ genistein @/sm$, and glycitein around 10%, 225%, and 36%, respectively, compared to the control. A previous study of our research group was carried out using different bacterial strains to ferment a soymilk extract, including Streptococcus thermophilus (YF-L811), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB-340), @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ ssp. lactis (Bb-12), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-05), that resulted in an increase 53 times greater than that of an unfermented extract. In another study, seven strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, including @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ ssp. lactis BLC 1, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 3, Streptococcus thermophilus ST 066, Lactobacillus casei MB151 (ATCC 334), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus MB153 (ATCC 9649), Lactobacillus rhamnosus MB154 (ATCC 7469), and Lactobacillus kefiri CBMAI212, were used. The fermentation process using all strains was able to reduce the content of isoflavone glycosides with a consequent increase in aglycones, varying between 6 and 8 times for daidzein, 5.6 and 7.4 times for @sm$ genistein @/sm$, and 2.3 and 3.8 times for glycitein, in comparison with the control. Other studies with soy-based foods used some bacterial cultures, such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. fermentum, and S. thermophilus, and several species of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were also responsible for increasing the content of aglycone isoflavones.	1
A putative transcriptional regulator sequence in the Crp/Fnr family (BLD37_RS01065, Table 5) was present in @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ MG1-116, but was not identified in the WGS C. jejuni strains or the reference strain, C. jejuni NCTC11168. However, several C. jejuni strains associated with Guillian Barre syndrome (GenBank accession numbers: CP012689.1, CP012689.1, CP002029.1) and C. jejuni strains in the ST 677 clonal complex isolated from human feces and blood (Bioproject PRJNA268846) harbor orthologous sequences (~58% sequence similarity) of putative CRP/Fnr family transcriptional regulators. Similarly, another sequence for a putative @sm$ peroxide @/sm$ stress regulator/ferric uptake regulation protein (Fur family) [(BLD37_RS05205) in @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ MG1-116] (Table 5) was identified in all @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ strains, but was absent in C.	3
A recent already mentioned outstanding study measured the ability of 76 human gut bacteria to metabolize 271 orally administered drugs (including agents used in antileukemic therapy, such as the corticosteroids prednisone and dexamethasone, @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib), and combined high-throughput genetic analyses with mass spectrometry to systematically identify microbial gene products that metabolize drugs.32 In this screen, dexamethasone was metabolized by Clostridium scindens (Firmicutes) in axenic bacterial cultures and was metabolized (side chain cleavage) in the intestine, particularly in the cecum, in mice mono-colonized with Clostridium scindens compared with GF mice. Notably, anaerobic incubation of dexamethasone with fecal cultures from 28 healthy human donors showed substantial interpersonal variation in metabolite production, suggesting that other bacterial taxa may also metabolize dexamethasone. A similar pattern was reported also for prednisone. Several Bacteroides species (Bacteroidetes), also significantly reduced (> 20%) corticosteroids: in particular, Bacteroides dorei acts on both dexamethasone and prednisone. @sm$ Cyclophosphamide @/sm$ is metabolized mainly by Firmicutes taxa, although the main metabolizer was @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ (Bacteroidetes).	2
A recent investigation revealed a significant reduction in the prevalence of Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Coprobacillus, and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species along with an increased abundance of Proteobacteria in persons with acne vulgaris. According to a hypothesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), sebum fatty acid, and sebum @sm$ triglyceride @/sm$ become stimulated by nutrient signaling disruption and lead to flourishment of Propionibacterium acnes.	0
A recent study has demonstrated that gut resident bacteria could promote epithelial restitution via inducing @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$) generation in epithelial cells. Microbiota epithelial cell interactions can activate beta-catenin signaling, a critical factor in regulating epithelial cell proliferation. @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ plays a significant role in wound healing by stimulating signaling pathways to increase the migration and proliferation of epithelial cells.	1
A respirometry assay was utilized to assess GABA as a potential @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source utilized by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$. Oxygen concentrations of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ cultures were measured via oxygraph machine to calculate respiration in response to different @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources. The @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources tested included GABA, glutamate, or erythritol. The metabolic role of glutamate is discussed above. Erythritol is a sugar alcohol found in the reproductive tracts of animals susceptible to brucellosis and has been shown to be a preferred @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source for brucellae growth as well as an inducer of virulence related genes. Oxygen is consumed during aerobic respiration, thus if the bacterium is actively utilizing the supplied @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source, then respiration will increase and oxygen concentrations of the culture medium will decrease. In the presence of erythritol, a preferred @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$, respiration occurred at a high rate and oxygen levels decreased rapidly (Fig 7B). In the presence of glutamate, a suitable @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and nitrogen source for @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$, but not preferred over erythritol, respiration occurred at a slower rate compared to erythritol, but oxygen consumption still occurred. In the presence of GABA, however, the change in oxygen concentration over time was negligible, indicating that GABA was not utilized as a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ (Fig 7B).	2
A second approach that we applied to determine if there is an association between microbiota composition and @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations in our animals was to identify which ASVs were most discriminatory between WT and CD19-/- mice using two different approaches; Lefse and Random Forest Analysis. From these results, we then determined whether discriminatory ASVs were significantly correlated with ileal @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations. Linear discriminant analysis using the Lefse pipeline identified eight species whose abundance were discriminatory between WT and CD19-/- mice (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Notably, the five species outgrown in CD19-/- mice were anaerobes or facultative anaerobes including Akkermansia muciniphila, @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$, two unidentified species within the Anaerostipes and Odoribacter genera, as well as an unidentified species within the Class Alphaproteobacteria (Supplementary Fig. S5B). While the outgrowth of these species co-varied with increased @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations in the ileum of CD19-/- mice, there was no statistically significant correlation between the abundance of any of these eight species with ileal @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S5C). In contrast, Random Forest analysis, a machine learning technique that we used to identify the minimal set of bacteria that maximally predict host genotype, revealed numerous associations between the abundance of discriminatory bacterial species and ileal @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations. Figure 1L reports the results of Random Forest analysis and summarizes the top fifteen most discriminating bacterial taxa that collectively predict mouse genotype (model (i.e., predictive) accuracy 83%). Eight of these fifteen discriminatory species were significantly correlated with ileal @sm$ BA @/sm$ concentrations in mice (Fig. 1M). Collectively, these data indicate that a number of features of dysbiosis observed in CD19-/- mice are strongly associated with abnormalities in the ileal @sm$ BA @/sm$ pool.	0
A side effect of lovastatin is inhibition of @sm$ isoprenoid @/sm$ synthesis and cell membrane formation in methanogenic Archaea, which are members of the human digestive tract microbiota and are emerging pathogens. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of the human-associated methanogens Methanobrevibacter smithii, @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$, Methanobrevibacter massiliense, Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis to lovastatin (1-4 microg/mL) was tested in the presence of five gut anaerobes aiming to metabolise lovastatin into beta-hydroxy acid lovastatin as confirmed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography.	3
A significant negative correlation was found between the relative amounts of Odoribacter, Nocardia, Halomonas, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, and Adlercreutzia and the mRNA relative expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFbeta. In addition, Polynucleobacter, with higher abundance in the DSS group, was negatively correlated with body weight, colon length, IL-10, and ZO-1 and positively linked with colon weight, serum TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, and CXCL1. In line with the current research, a previous study found that bacterial genera, including Clostridium, Parabacteroides, Adlercreutzia, Odoribacter, and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, possess potentially beneficial effects on the improvement of inflammatory disease by enhancing the levels of SCFAs and IL-10, adjusting the balance of T cells and Th1/Th17 cells, blocking proinflammatory cytokine production, and maintaining normal intestinal barrier function. Polynucleobacter is involved in @sm$ aspartate @/sm$ synthesis, which acts as an alternative carbon source for glutamine to power diseased cells, illustrating that AVLP normalizes intestinal glutamine in colitis mice.	2
A significant upregulation of the @sm$ glycerophospholipid @/sm$ metabolism could be observed in anti-PD-1 responders. This led the authors to speculate that differences in the microbiome affect the @sm$ glycerophospholipid @/sm$ metabolism, which alters IFN-gamma and IL-2 expression in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in better anti-PD-1 response. When fecal samples from healthy volunteers were administered to GF mice, the extent of IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T-cell induction was donor dependent. Eleven species were positively associated with IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T-cell induction: Parabacteroides distasonis, Parabacteroides gordonii, @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$, Parabacteroides johnsonii, Paraprevotella xylaniphila, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides uniformis JCM 5828, Eubacterium limosum, Ruminococcaceae bacterium cv2, Phascolarctobacterium faecium and Fusobacterium ulcerans.	1
A significantly increased ratio of Prevotella/Bacteroides, which revealed an increased ability to digest simple @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, was found in the captive cohort. A significant decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and enrichment of genes related to the pentose phosphate pathway were noted in the captive cohort, indicating a decreased ability of captive monkeys to digest fiber. Additionally, genes required for glutamate biosynthesis were also significantly more abundant in the captive cohort than in the wild cohort. These changes in the gut microbiome correspond to changes in the composition of the diet in captive animals, which has more simple @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ and less crude fiber and protein than the diet of the wild animals. In addition, more unique bacteria in captive R. roxellana were involved in antibiotic resistance (Acinetobacter) and diarrhea (Desulfovibrio piger), and in the prevention of diarrhea (@gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$) caused by Clostridioides difficile.	2
A similar bactericidal efficacy of PAA and @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$ with the agar diffusion method, as well as @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$ compared with CHX or EDTA with similar concentrations with the direct method have been reported. The agar diffusion test results in this research showed that all root canal irrigation solutions in all concentrations formed inhibition zones with both bacteria investigated. PAA showed relatively large inhibition zones against E. faecalis and relatively smaller ones against @gm$ P. micra @/gm$. To the best of our knowledge, no agar diffusion investigations are available in which PAA had been used against E. faecalis or @gm$ P. micra @/gm$. The largest inhibition zone diameters against E. faecalis occurred decreasingly with 5.0, 3.0 and 1.0% @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$ which are similar to other reports. In the @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ group, relatively smaller inhibition zones formed; yet, they did not increase with the PAA concentration. The same inhibitory effect of @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$ against E. faecalis and @gm$ P. micra @/gm$; however, smaller inhibitions zones, as in other investigations, were observed.	3
A similar effect was observed in animal models treated with @sm$ sodium arsenate @/sm$. Parabacteroides distasonis and @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ strains of GM showed good anti-oxidant activity in different brain cell lines; thus, they exhibited neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. Furthermore, @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ were associated with reduced pro-inflammatory IL-6 secretion.	0
A small fermentor (55 mL) was directly interfaced to a membrane inlet mass spectrometer for continuous on-line monitoring of oxygen and volatile metabolites during batch fermentations of the starter culture @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$. Using this technique, we were able to correlate production of the very important flavor compounds 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, and @sm$ 2-methylpropanal @/sm$ with various growth conditions. We found that the aldehydes were present in the culture broth only as transient metabolites. They were produced in the exponential growth phase, reached a maximum concentration when the culture became anaerobic, and then they rapidly disappeared from the culture medium. This general pattern was observed for three different strains of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ and S. carnosus. Small amounts of inoculum or increased exposure to oxygen were found to favor production of the aldehydes as a result of a longer aerobic growth period. Growing @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ under conditions resembling those in a fermented sausage revealed that NaCl (5%) increased aldehyde production considerably, whereas KNO(3) (0.03%) or NaNO(2) (0.03%) had little effect.	1
A strain D3 of denitrifying bacterium was isolated from an anammox reactor, and identified as @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ based on the morphological and physiological assay, Vitek test, Biolog test, (G + C) mol% content, and 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis. As a typical denitrifying bacterium, strain D3 achieved the maximal nitrate reduction rate of 26.2 mg/(L x d) at the nitrate concentration of 88.5 mg @sm$ N @/sm$/L.	2
A strong similarity of 16S rRNA sequences (99.8%) was shown between strain @gm$ FR62/b/3 @/gm$(T) and Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum LMG 21775(T). However, low DNA-DNA relatedness was observed between their DNAs (31%). The new isolates are able to grow at low temperatures (all ten strains up to 5 degrees C) and strain @gm$ FR62/b/3 @/gm$(T) grows under aerobic conditions, as does B. psychraerophilum. However, contrary to B. psychraerophilum, they do not ferment L-arabinose, D-xylose, arbutin or melezitose, but they do acidify @sm$ lactose @/sm$. The DNA G+C content of FR62/b/3(T) is 56.4mol%. Therefore, the name Bifidobacterium crudilactis sp. nov. is proposed, with its type strain being @gm$ FR62/b/3 @/gm$(T) (=@gm$ LMG 23609 @/gm$(T)=@gm$ CNCM I-3342 @/gm$(T)).	2
A study by reported antibiotic resistance in all the @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ strains of reptile origin tested, 72% of which were multidrug-resistant strains. The most frequently observed resistance pattern was the combination of gentamicin-colistin and gentamicin-colistin-ampicillin. The high resistance against gentamicin is suspected to be a result of the indiscriminate use of @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$ by pet reptile breeders. Gentamicin is commonly used in the USA as a prophylactic @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ treatment in eggs to reduce bacterial loads. Some studies have focused exclusively on the production of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-free reptiles, and various treatment methods have been evaluated, including antimicrobials such as oxytetracycline, gentamicin or chloramphenicol in water or directly on the eggs. However, although some of these methods resulted in the reduction of infection and/or shedding rates in hatchling turtles, their excessive use also increased antibiotic resistance. Other substances, such as sodium hypochlorite and polyhexamethylene biguanides or chlorhexidine gluconate also lead to some degree of reduction in @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ carriage of hatchlings. However, in general, efforts to eliminate @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp.	4

A study determined MICs for 10 antimicrobials of 10 Mexican @gm$ ORT @/gm$ isolates alongside 10 previously characterized strains. MIC values greater than 128 mg/mL were recorded for gentamicin, @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfachloropyridazine were identified among isolates. Field reports from that country confirmed that the use of gentamicin or @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$ had no effect when used in therapy in infected flocks, and based on these results, the authors recommended that amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, or oxytetracycline as drugs of choice.	4

A study identified other strains, including Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$ at the phylum level. The abundance of 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria significantly increased and was 42-fold higher in gallstone subjects than in gallstone-free contrlos. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity and @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ saturation, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria.	2
A study reported that the tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrDC) enzyme produced by small intestinal bacteria from the genera Enterococcus and Lactobacillus is responsible for the decarboxylation of L-dopa into @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ in the gut. Interestingly, the authors showed that Enterococcus faecalis compromised L-dopa uptake and did not present susceptibility to carbidopa treatment. In addition, they reported that the relative abundance of tyrDC gene in stool samples from PD patients was positively correlated with higher daily L-dopa dosage requirement. Related with this study, a different group described another possible pathway for gut bacterial L-dopa metabolism. They showed that tyrDC from Enterococcus faecalis converted L-dopa to @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ and that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of dopamine dehydroxylases (dadh) from @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$, subsequently metabolized @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ into m-tyramine, thus reducing @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ bioavailability.	1
A study revealed that patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) fatigue had reduced serum metabolites like Met, Ser and @sm$ sarcosine @/sm$ (Sar), and decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. In a controlled study of Parkinson's disease (PD), significant differences in the trajectories of Met and homoserine were found. And the PD-associated gut microbiome analysis revealed increased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ involved in sulfur metabolism.	0
A study was conducted to examine the diversity of cultivable @sm$ P @/sm$-solubilizing bacteria in C. sinensis. Over 900 rhizoplane bacteria were randomly selected and were identified using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and isolates belonging to Bacillus (34.6%), Pseudomonas (8.9%), Stenotrophomonas (6.1%), Paenibacillus (5.9%), and Arthrobacter (4.8%) were identified. The leaf of C. sinensis showed antimicrobial properties against S. aureus, Vibrio cholerae, C. jejuni, S. epidermidis, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, L.	0
A study was made of how the catabolism of a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and energy source is affected by the biosynthetic demands of growing bacterial cells. Cultures of @gm$ Aerobacter aerogenes @/gm$ in l-histidine medium were grown in a chemostat at rates determined by the supply of either sulfate or a required amino acid, l-arginine. It was discovered that the rate at which these cells grow under a biosynthetic restriction determines both the rate and the pattern of histidine degradation. (i) Histidine catabolism is partially coupled to the growth rate. This coupling is achieved by catabolite repression of histidase (histidine ammonia lyase; EC 4.3.1.3.), and also by a slightly decreased in vivo function of this enzyme at low growth rates. (ii) The looseness of the coupling results in a direct relationship between growth rate and growth yield, and possibly is correlated with an altered pattern of @sm$ carbon @/sm$ flow from histidine.	2
A survey of 154 strains from 22 species of human colonic bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus @/gm$, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, and Fusobacterium species, revealed no laminarin fermenters, except for a single @gm$ Peptostreptococcus productus @/gm$ strain. More recently, the ability of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species to utilize laminarin for growth has been demonstrated. Notably, growth of bacteroides species on laminarin was found to induce specifically beta-1,3-glucanase activity, portending the discovery of beta-1,3-glucan-specific @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ utilization loci in select Bacteroides and other Bacteroidetes (Dejean et al.,).	2
A three-fold increase in the abundance of @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$, which was shown to possess high immunogenic potential, was reported in IBD patients when compared to healthy individuals, suggesting this archaeon might be involved in pathologic conditions within the human gut. Studies also indicated a lower proportion of patients were positive for methanogens in their gut compared to controls, primarily due to a reduction in the number of M. smithii in IBD subjects. A recent report found significantly lower M. smithii levels among IBD patients compared to healthy individuals, with the levels returning to normal values in disease remission. To conclude, the shift in archaeal populations associated with IBD could be related to bacterial dysbiosis and alteration in the intestinal nutritional environment (i.e., reduction of hydrogen gas and increase of short-chain alcohols such as @sm$ methanol @/sm$), favoring methylotrophic archaeal species, particularly @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$, thus increasing the inflammatory response within the human gut.	2
A total of 155 viridans group streptococci blood culture isolates identified by the Rapid ID32 Strep system were tested for their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$, rifampicin, vancomycin and teicoplanin using the E-test. The following species were identified: S. oralis (n = 67), S. mitis (n = 66), S. sanguis (n = 7), S. salivarius (n = 5), @gm$ S. parasanguis @/gm$ (n = 4), S. gordonii (n = 3) and S. mutans (n = 3). S. oralis and S. mitis demonstrated the highest levels of resistance to the agents tested. There were 27% of S. oralis isolates resistant to pencillin, 51% resistant to erythromycin and 6% resistant to @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$. For S. mitis 11% were resistant to penicillin, 40% resistant to erythromycin and 3% resistant to @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$. Penicillin resistant isolates (MIC > or = 2 mg/l) also demonstrated decreased susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents tested in this study. High level resistance (MIC > or = 2 mg/l) to ceftriaxone was found in 12 isolates. The isolates identified as ceftriaxone resistant comprised S. oralis (n = 7), S. mitis (n = 4) and @gm$ S. parasanguis @/gm$ (n = 1).	3
A total of 1724 clinical isolates from patients with different infections were tested in vitro to determine their susceptibility to @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$. Antibacterial activity of @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$ was compared with other drugs that were commonly used in the hospital. Of the 919 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, all except four isolates of Enterobacter, two of Serratia and one of Proteus were susceptible to @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$. Ninety-five percent of the 199 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also inhibited by this quinolone. @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ (81 strains) was completely susceptible to @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$. All the 250 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also sensitive to @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$. Pseudomonads other than P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter/Alcaligenes and group D streptococci were less sensitive to @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$, with 56%, 57% and 20% respectively being inhibited by this antimicrobial agent.	3
A total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP) gene (lnpA) and examined for growth when LNB was used as the sole @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ source. While all strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. breve, and B. bifidum were able to grow on LNB, none of the strains of B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, B.	2
A total of 550 oral streptococci: 270 Streptococcus mitis, 110 Streptococcus sanguis, 90 Streptococcus anginosus, 50 Streptococcus mutans, 30 @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$, were isolated from dental plaque and gengival crevices of patients and tested for their susceptibility to 12 beta-lactam antibiotics and to 5 non-beta-lactam antibiotics, using the microdiluition method. Overall, a reduced susceptibility to penicillin was recorded in 13.4% of cases. The percentage of strains resistant to penicillin appeared significantly higher in S. mitis (24%) than in S. sanguis (19%), in S. mutans (14%) and in @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ (10%). No levels of penicillin resistance were shown by 90 strains of S. anginosus. In susceptibility test to antibiotics, imipenem was the most active molecule tested, confirming its general good activity against oral streptococci. Also third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and fourth generation cephalosporins such as cefepime, showed good activity. Chinolones, glycopeptides and @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ confirmed a good activity against oral streptococci.	3
A total of 65% of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ were predicted to be resistant to phenicol antibiotics with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Furthermore, 53% of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ were predicted to be resistant (antibiotic target replacement) to sulfonamide antibiotics as they harbored sul. In addition, 5% of the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ were predicted to be resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, 2% to penicillin antibiotics, and 2% to macrolide antibiotics by harboring @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance-determining regions (QRDRs), metallo-beta-lactamase gene (MbetaL; varG), and efflux-pump genes (varACDEF), respectively.	4
A total of 70 @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ isolates recovered from 114 cattle and 177 pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse level were characterized by the presence of 7 putative virulence genes and antimicrobial susceptibility using the microbroth dilution method and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The prevalence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ was 14.9% and 29.9% in cattle and pig samples, respectively. The majority of cattle carcasses were contaminated with C. jejuni (64.7%), whereas pig carcasses were mainly positive for @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ (77.4%). Most of the strain, irrespective of origin, possessed at least one pathogenic gene marker tested, mainly flaA and cadF genes responsible for motility and adherence to host epithelial cells, respectively. Several isolates also possessed the cdtA and cdtB genes responsible for the production of cytolethal distending toxin. Antibiotic profiling showed that campylobacters were most frequently resistant to quinolones (nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, total 57.1% of isolates) followed by streptomycin (52.9%, only @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ strains) and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (51.4%). Resistance to erythromycin was demonstrated only in 4 @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ strains of pig origin. None of the isolates, irrespective of origin, was resistant to gentamycin. Multi-resistance patterns, defined as resistance to antimicrobials of at least two different classes, were observed among 65.4% of the isolates, mainly @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ recovered from pig carcasses.	4
A unique thermostable amylosucrase from @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ was produced as a recombinant protein with the half-life of 577 h at 50  C. By adding 1.0 M fructose, turanose yield was improved from 22.7% to 43.3% with 1.0 M @sm$ sucrose @/sm$, and from 23.7% to 39.4% with 1.5 M @sm$ sucrose @/sm$. @sm$ Sucrose @/sm$ consumption rate was greatest at 55  C, but the lowest amount of turanose was produced. Thus, turanose yield from @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ biomass was inversely proportional to reaction temperature and was highly dependent on [fructose]. Meanwhile, insoluble alpha-glucan yield was clearly reduced as [fructose] increased. With 1.0 M fructose + 1.0 M @sm$ sucrose @/sm$, glucan byproduct yield significantly decreased from 29.4% to 1.1%. Molecular weights of linear glucans were almost identical among various [@sm$ sucrose]s @/sm$ and were homogenous with very low polydispersity. This unique dual reaction patterns of amylosucrase enzyme would be very useful for massive productions of two different biomaterials simply by changing @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ biomass concentration.	2
A variety of proteins and @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ degrading enzymes were secreted by gut microbiota. In colon contents, 17 microbial proteins were common in the low- and the high-salt diet groups. Five proteins had a higher abundance in the high-salt diet group than those in the LSD group (Supplementary Table S3), including cytidylate kinase, trigger factor, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transporter, and undecaprenyl-diphosphatase, which were secreted by different gut bacteria, including Atopobium parvulum, @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, Lactobacillus brevis, Anaerostipes hadrus, and Streptococcus agalactiae.	1
A wide variety of microorganisms accumulate PHAs as a carbon and energy storage material in carbon-excess conditions when a major nutrient (typically nitrogen or @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$) is limiting (Elbahloul and Steinbuchel; Rehm; Brandl et al.). Accumulation of excess carbon is a general mechanism used by @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ and is essential for resource balancing (de Eugenio et al.; Escapa et al.). De Smet et al.  detected the inclusion bodies in @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ olevorans for first time when grown on octane and identified is as polymer of 3-hydroxyoctanoate.	2
ADHD samples show higher @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ (serotonin precursor) import fluxes by @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ compared to the Control, and no @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ export exists. This might result from a @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ hydrolysis reaction where @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ is hydrolyzed to indole, pyruvate, and ammonium with tryptophanase catalysis. There is no correlation between @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ import and the three diet types. In terms of gender, the difference between Control and ADHD sample fluxes of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ is more drastic for male pairs than for female pairs. This might partially explain why males show more clear ADHD symptoms than females. ADHD gut also imports @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ by Bacteroides coprocola at a significantly higher rate. The amount of @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ imported by ADHD samples by another Bacteroides species, B. uniformis, is more significant compared to Control samples. D. longicatena imports @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$, but fluxes are below 1 mmol/gDCW h. For D. longicatena, @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ consumption or indole production is not mentioned previously for the gut of ADHD subjects in the literature. Only one subject with ADHD (female) has Bacillus licheniformis (0.12% abundance). There is @sm$ L-tryptophan @/sm$ import under the Western Diet and export under Atkins' and Vegan diets by this species, but these fluxes are not significant in amount.	2

AGS cells were cultured overnight in 4-chamber Lab-Tek slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL, USA), washed with PBS, treated for 5 h with @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$, washed, and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized and blocked for 15 min at 22 C with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (NGS), followed by 15 min at 22 C with Image-iT  FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen). The slides were washed and incubated overnight at 4 C with rabbit or mouse primary antibodies to MUC1, beta-catenin, or @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ CagA, all diluted 1/100 in PBS containing 2% BSA, 2% NGS, and 0.05% @sm$ Tween 20 @/sm$.	3
AIM: In the present study, malic acid in combination with @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$ is evaluated for eradication of biofilms formed by @gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ strains individually and in a cocktail on different abiotic surfaces. METHOD AND RESULTS: The biofilm formation by five strains of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ and their cocktail culture on different substrates was studied in Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) and reconstituted Powdered Infant Formula (PIF). Further, the effect of temperature (4, 27, 37 and 50 C) and contact time (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min) on antibiofilm potential of test solution (0.0625 mol l-1 malic acid and 0.00004 mol l-1 @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$) against biofilm formed by @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ cocktail culture was investigated on these surfaces. The effect was evaluated in terms of viable cell count and biofilm texture using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that the maximum biofilm reduction was observed for stainless steel at 4 C after 60 min of contact whereas at 25, 37 and 50 C, maximum biofilm reduction was observed for polycarbonate. For glass and polyurethane, maximum log reductions were observed at 50 C. The SEM images revealed cell surface deformation and disruption in biofilms after treatment with the test solution. CONCLUSIONS: The antibiofilm potential was observed to be greatly affected by contact time and temperature. These results indicated that the combination of malic acid @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$ can effectively kill and remove @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ biofilms from food contact surfaces and enteral feeding tubes.	3
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a fraction of burdock (Arctium lappa L.) leaf on the initial adhesion, biofilm formation, quorum sensing and virulence factors of @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antibiofilm activity of the burdock leaf fraction was studied by the method of crystal violet staining. When the concentration of the burdock leaf fraction was 2 0 mg ml-1 , the inhibition rates on biofilm formation of @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ were 100%. The burdock leaf fraction was found to inhibit the formation of biofilm by reducing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, decreasing bacterial aggregation ability and inhibiting swarming motility. Interestingly, the burdock leaf fraction inhibited the secretion of quorum-sensing (QS) signalling molecule 3-oxo-C12-HSL and interfered quorum sensing. Moreover, the QS-regulated @sm$ pyocyanin @/sm$ and elastase were also inhibited. Chemical composition analysis by UPLC-MS showed 11 active compounds in the burdock leaf fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The burdock leaf fraction significantly inhibited the formation of biofilm and quorum sensing, as well as significantly decreased the content of virulence factors. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study introduces a natural and effective bacterial biofilm inhibitor, which could also significantly decrease the content of virulence factors and the drug resistance of @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$.	3
AIMS: To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ (Salm. Choleraesuis) and to delineate the AMP-responsive mechanisms of wild-type (WT) and MDR strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Proteomic approaches were performed based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole- time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyse the protein profiles of these two strains upon exposure to AMP GW-Q6. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to determine the mRNA expression level of the target genes. Furthermore, @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) competition analysis was used to verify whether @sm$ LPS @/sm$ may serve as the potential binding target when AMP approach and adhere to the bacterial surface. CONCLUSIONS: The minimal inhibitory concentration assay revealed that our AMPs were even more effective against the MDR strains (4-32 mug ml(-1) ), compared with those for the WT (8-64 mug ml(-1) ). @sm$ LPS @/sm$ dose-dependently suppressed the GW-Q6 antimicrobial activity.	3
ASV counts demonstrated a potential change in relative abundance of one genus, @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, with @sm$ colchicine @/sm$ having a nominally-significant (but not FDR-corrected significant) decrease in counts as compared to placebo (-33.5 +- 118.4 vs. 102.5 +- 183.9 counts; p=0.04). Changes in @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ counts were nominally significantly associated with changes in concentrations of the inflammatory markers hsCRP (rho=0.433, p=0.02), neutrophils (rho=0.508, p=0.007), and resistin (rho=0.554, p=0.003), while correlations with GlycA (rho=0.370, p=0.057) and WBC (rho=0.355, p=0.07) trended towards but did not reach nominal statistical significance (Fig. 5). No significant correlations were seen with changes in @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ amplicon counts and IL-6 (rho=0.294, p=0.15).	3

Abundances of Faecalibacillus intestinalis, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Ruminococcus torques, and Dorea sp. AF24-7LB were positively associated with IFG, and such associations were partially mediated by @sm$ 1-methylxanthine @/sm$ and nicotinate (variance accounted for mean 14.4% [SD 5.1], P < 0.05).	1
Abundant evidence suggests that vaginal lactobacilli such as @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ are required for the health of the genital tract in women. By producing @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, vaginal lactobacilli maintain an acidic vaginal environment with a pH range of 2.8-4.2. Loss of vaginal lactobacilli, for example, due to broad spectrum antibiotics, may cause vaginal dysbiosis, leading to yeast vaginosis. SF1, SF2 and SF3 are all well tolerated by vaginal lactobacilli (Fig 6). However, how they would affect other microbiotas, particularly the gut microbiota, as well as other beneficial components of the vaginal microbiota is not known. Addressing this question with certainty will require human studies for two reasons. First, most microbiota components are not cultivable. Second, humans and animals differ in microbiota composition substantially. For example, most animals have a near neutral vaginal pH. There are @sm$ lactic-acid @/sm$ producing microbes in the lower genital tract of some non-human primates, but their vaginal pH is significantly higher than that of women.	1
According to Fardiaz @sm$ CGA @/sm$ and caffeic acids, are nonvolatile organic acids found in coffee, inhibit the growth of some Gram-positive bacteria like (S. aureus, B. cereus, L. bulgaricus, @gm$ S. lactis @/gm$ and S.	3
According to local characteristics the resistance profile of the Adult ICU/UFU has been defined as follows: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis sensitive or not to oxacillin (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ resistant to carbapenems (@sm$ imipenem @/sm$ and meropenem), enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae spp, Serratia spp) for the production of beta-lactamase extended spectrum (ESBL) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	4
According to the MIC data, multidrug-resistant genes of 133 Salmonella enterica serovar Indiana and 177 @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis @/gm$ were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected for ampicillin-resistant isolates (bla TEM and bla PSE); chloramphenicol/@sm$ florfenicol @/sm$-resistant isolates (catA1, catA2, catA3, cmlA and floR); tetracycline-resistant isolates (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD and tetG), streptomycin-resistant isolates (aadA, strA and strB), fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr and qepA), and integrase genes (int1, int2 and int3).	3
According to the calculations performed here, the RuMP cycle is heavily limited by the @sm$ NAD @/sm$-dependent MDH reaction which is thermodynamically and kinetically very unfavorable. Also, the forward rate constant at a temperature of 37 C was taken which is a lot lower than the temperature of its native host. Apart from the unfavorable kinetics of the MDH, the RuMP cycle using @sm$ NAD @/sm$-dependent MDH was only thermodynamically feasible if the upper and lower bounds for @sm$ NAD @/sm$/@sm$ NADH @/sm$ and NADP/NADPH were extended further by a factor of 10. It remains enigmatic how microorganisms like @gm$ Bacillus methanolicus @/gm$ use this enzyme at a high specific rate, but the elevated temperature requirement might play a role here. Alternatively, the enzyme kinetics and maybe even the thermodynamics could be fundamentally different in vivo since, for engineered E. coli with a functional RuMP cycle, it was speculated that formaldehyde was accumulating, and thus, the MDH was not the limiting factor (F. Y. H.). The PQQ-dependent MDH catalyzes an exergonic reaction, and thus, the pathways with this enzyme are in general predicted to have a higher specific activity, but with a lower product yield as the electrons are directly channeled to the respiratory chain. Indeed, all pathways using the @sm$ NAD @/sm$-dependent MDH were limited by the methanol oxidation reaction rather than by the enzymes of the pathways themselves in our calculations. Therefore, only the results with the PQQ-dependent MDH are shown in Figure 7. The @sm$ NAD @/sm$-dependent specific activities and product-substrate yields can be found in the supplement in Figure S13, though.	2
According to the criteria of Popoff, 66% of the strains were identified as Aeromonas caviae, 18% were identified as @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$, and 16% were identified as A. hydrophila. Some biochemical characteristics differed from the criteria of Popoff; 19 of 40 (48%) of tested strains were encapsulated, 42 of 124 (34%) of A. caviae strains were nonmotile, and all @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ strains were resistant to @sm$ KCN @/sm$. Gas production from D-glucose was temperature dependent; 11 of 64 (17%) A. hydrophila and @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ strains produced gas only at 22 degrees C.	4
According to the findings, Schisandra chinensis, an important source of @sm$ lignans @/sm$, reduced alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerides, fasting blood sugar levels, and fat mass. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) examination of the gut microbiome revealed that while the amount of Ruminococcus was lower in the treatment group compared with the placebo group, the amount of Akkermansia, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Roseburia increased.	1
According to the obtained media analysis data, it can be indirectly concluded that indole is contained in vesicles of at least five analyzed species, including @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ 807, Bacteroides salyersiae 2697, Bacteroides xylanisolvens Pik, Bacteroides eggerthii 91 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens EBA 5-17. At the same time, the exact composition of the components can only be judged by analyzing isolated OMVs. However, rather contradictory changes were noted, in particular the accumulation of components in the bacterial media cleared of vesicles (media w/o OMVs). Thus, for @sm$ 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol @/sm$, such a dependence was noted for most of the studied species, which is probably due to the peculiarities of the component extraction and sample preparation.	0
According to the results shown in Table 2, butyrate was produced by the 9SC, which was an expected result since the main butyrate producing-bacteria in the human gut belong to the phylum Firmicutes, in particular Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium leptum, Eubacterium rectale, and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp.. A strong butyrogenic effect was observed in microbial-FOS-added sample (p < 0.001), as butyrate production was higher than the negative control, @sm$ glucose @/sm$-added, and Frutalose  OFP-added media, at 12 h and 30 h.	1
Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive @sm$ polyamine @/sm$ production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G.	1
Acetate producing bacteria, @gm$ barnesiella @/gm$, was improved with the FO diet in male mice. This is important as acetate is one of the abundant short chain fatty acids (SCFA) known to prevent obesity associated inflammation in rodent models. Moreover, acetate is known to improve @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ oxidation through increases in AMPK. Furthermore, apart from its systemic role, acetate also has beneficial effects in improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. In addition, the @gm$ barnesiella @/gm$ was not altered in female mice, indicating the sexual dimorphic role of FO in the microbial environment. However, whether the improvements in @gm$ barnesiella @/gm$ translate into increases in acetate levels remains to be tested.	1
Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter sp.LC458, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter rudis, Acinetobacter soli and Acinetobacter sp.BMW17 were the most affected species. Additionally, Achromobacter piechaudii and Achromobacter sp.LC458 were the absolute dominant species in the UC group, suggesting that it may be related to the state of UC disease. Compared with the NG group, Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter sp.LC458 and Acinetobacter baumannii were increased and Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter rudis, Acinetobacter soli and Acinetobacter sp. BMW17 were decreased in the UC model group. In addition, we found significantly lower abundance of Acinetobacter baumannii in the moxibustion group than in the UC group. We also noted that Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter rudis, Acinetobacter soli and Acinetobacter sp. BMW17 were increased in moxibustion, @sm$ mesalazine @/sm$ and normal rats with moxibustion groups than UC group.	3
Addition of any non-digestible but fermentable, @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ to the diet will increase fermentative activity, especially in the proximal colon, resulting in increased acid production. This tends to decrease luminal pH, with important consequences for the composition of the microbiota and the balance of microbial metabolites. In vitro studies indicate that Bacteroides populations are likely to be curtailed, while butyrate-producing Firmicutes are favored, within the community at mildly acidic pH. Reduced overall intake of complex dietary @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ by obese subjects on weight loss diets was found to decrease short chain fatty acid formation, with a disproportionate decrease in fecal butyrate. Interestingly, the major butyrate-producing bacteria detected on high @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ diets were the starch-utilizing @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp and E. rectale and the decrease in fecal butyrate on diets very low in @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ was associated with a major decrease in this group, with F. prausnitzii becoming the main butyrate producer. Dietary complex @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ also decrease the levels of potentially harmful metabolites that arise from proteolytic activity in the colon.	2
Additional folic acid supplementation can attenuate liver injury under a high-fat diet (HFD), and ameliorate liver @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation. Thus, Parasutterella secunda, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, and Clostridium saccharogumia, which are related to FA, might be potential targets for regulating the production of FA to ameliorate fatty liver.	1
Additional studies have shown that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ can enhance the function of the intestinal mucus layer and phagocytes through the activation of intestinal autophagy and @sm$ calcium @/sm$ signaling pathways.	1
Additional to the potential advantage conferred by the higher number of CAZy genes deserved to @sm$ arabinoxylan @/sm$ degradation, we observed that the @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ genome is enriched in peptidases and glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes constituting a signal of O-glycan foraging from host gut mucins as previously inferred for this and other Bacteroides species. This could indicate that in absence of @sm$ arabinoxylans @/sm$ or other complex carbohydrates from the host diet, B.	2

Additionally, GM ferment protein and amino acids; the Clostridium genus is a fundamental bacteria for lysine or @sm$ proline @/sm$ utilization, whereas bacteria of the Peptostreptococcus genus are the critical driver of glutamate or tryptophan use. Other important bacteria of the genera are Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Veillonella, and the species @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ and Selenomonas ruminantium.	2
Additionally, IRE1alpha stimulates caspase-1 and caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage, indicating its crucial function in inducing canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation in @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection. Previous studies corroborate the involvement of the IRE1alpha in the activation of the NLRP3 canonical inflammasome. For example, IRE1alpha mediates @sm$ saturated fatty-acid @/sm$-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, during irremediable ER stress, IRE1alpha promotes inflammasome activation by inducing Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP), which is crucial for pro-caspase-1 cleavage and IL-beta secretion. Furthermore, it was previously demonstrated in macrophages that @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-induced mROS is crucial for NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome activation and a previous report indicated that infection with an attenuated @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ strain induces IRE1alpha and activates the inflammasome via NLRP3-driven mitochondrial damage. Accordingly, we demonstrated here that IRE1alpha drives the production of mROS in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-infected macrophages.	3
Additionally, TT17573 (oppBC tppB dpp) strain expressing @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ ABC transporter locus (TMS14) was constructed. STm WT and mutants were grown overnight at 37 C on a rotary shaker in LB media or minimal M9 media [47.7 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 8.6 mM NaCl, 18.6 mM NH4Cl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM @sm$ CaCl2 @/sm$] supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 1 microg/mL thiamine.	2
Additionally, a new benzamide derivative, fusarithioamide A (16), along with 1-O-acetyl-glycerol (17) and 8-acetylneosolaniol (18), was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the same strain, and is a good new candidate as a potential antimicrobial and cytotoxic agent as it displayed potent and selective cytotoxic activity toward BT-549 and SKOV-3 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.4 and 0.8 muM, respectively, compared to @sm$ doxorubicin @/sm$ (IC50 0.046 and 0.313 muM, respectively). Fusarithioamide A also possessed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values of 3.1, 4.4, and 6.9 mg mL-1 and inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) of 19.0, 14.1, and 22.7 mm against @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively, compared to ciprofloxacin (IZDs of 20.7, 16.6, and 26.9 mm, respectively). Further extensive investigation of this extract resulted in the identification of a new aminobenzamide derivative, fusarithioamide B (19), and four known metabolites: stigmast-4-ene-3-one (20), stigmasta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (21), p-hydroxyacetophenone (22) and tyrosol (23). Furthermore, fusarithioamide B displayed selective cytotoxic potency toward the BT-549, MCF-7, SKOV-3, and HCT-116 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.09, 0.21, 1.23, and 0.59 muM, compared to @sm$ doxorubicin @/sm$ (IC50 values of 0.046, 0.05, 0.321, and 0.24 muM, respectively); it also showed selective antifungal activity toward C. albicans (MIC of 1.9 mug mL-1 and IZD of 14.5 mm), compared to clotrimazole (MIC of 2.8 mug mL-1 and IZD of 17.9 mm); finally, it also possessed potent antibacterial potential toward E. coli (IZD of 25.1 mm; MIC of 3.7 mg mL-1), @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ (IZD of 23.0 mm; MIC of 2.5 mg mL-1), and S.	3
Additionally, butyrate promotes memory cell differentiation of CD8+ T cells via uncoupling of the TCA cycle from glycolysis and promotion of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ oxidation. The positive effect of butyrate on CD8+ T cell memory response was dependent on GPR41 and GPR43. Another SCFA, pentanoate produced by human commensal bacteria @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ induced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in CD8+ T cells in vitro and enhanced anti-tumor activity of Ag-specific T cells in mice.	1
Additionally, our findings suggested that 16 microbial species may be essential to the content of fatty acids in the muscle, especially @sm$ C12:0 @/sm$ (@sm$ lauric acid @/sm$). 4 bacterial species, including Achromobacter xylosoxidans, @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, and Mycobacterium dioxanotrophicus, were positively correlated with @sm$ C12:0 @/sm$, while 13 bacteria, including Methanobrevibacter millerae, Bacteroidales bacterium CF, and Bacteroides coprosuis were negatively correlated with @sm$ C12:0 @/sm$.	0
Additionally, the TonB complex is required for optimal uptake of the DHBA siderophore and/or @sm$ citrate @/sm$ in B. melitensis . As seen with the DHBA siderophore, transcription of tonB, exbB, exbD was increased in @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ infection at 5 and 24 h. No significant difference in expression at the two time points was observed suggesting the long term need of this iron acquisition system. Transcription of tonB, exbB, exbD in B. melitensis infection was unchanged at 24 h compared to broth-grown bacterial cells supporting the greater covert lifestyle of B. melitensis compared to @gm$ B. canis @/gm$.	2
Additionally, the gene encoding oligosaccharide reducing-end xylanase (rexA; EC:3.2.1.156) was expressed by A.rectalis, R.intestinalis and @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$ indicating interactions driven by availability of public goods (Supplementary Fig. 9). Previously, A.rectalis was reported to utilize the hydrolysis products of arabinoxylan i.e., whole (A)XOS while releasing @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ and xylose outside the cell, likely supporting xylose and @sm$ arabinose @/sm$-utilizing bacteria. E.siraeum dominated the xylose degradation module, followed by @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$ while relatively lower abundances of transcripts were observed for A.rectalis, A.soehngenii, B.ovatus, R.intestinalis (Supplementary Fig. 10). The @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ that was released by the likely action of arabinofuranosidases produced by E.siraeum and A.rectalis, was converted by enzymes encoded by genes of the @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ degradation module in several Db-MM members, including A.soehngenii, B.ovatus, B.xylanisolvens, C.catus, R.intestinalis and @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$.	2
Additionally, the relative abundances of fecal Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Fusobacterium spp., Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Parabacteroides spp., Pontibacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Roseburia spp., Tannerella spp., Butyricimonas spp., Clostridium spp., Coprococcus spp., Escherichia spp., Pontibacillus spp., Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Absiella dolichum, Bacillus bogoriensis, Barnesiella viscericola, Coprobacter secundus, @gm$ Intestinimonas butyriciproducens @/gm$, Odoribacter laneus, Mediterranea massiliensis, Barnesiella viscericola, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Inediibacterium massiliense, were positively (P < 0.05) correlated with fecal ammonium, isobutyrate, isovalerate, total BCFA, @sm$ phenol @/sm$, 4-ethylphenol, total @sm$ phenol @/sm$, indole, and total @sm$ phenol @/sm$ and indole concentrations, and negatively (P < 0.05) correlated with fecal acetate, propionate, valerate, and total SCFA concentrations. Finally, Shigella spp. were positively (P < 0.05) correlated with fecal ammonium, isobutyrate, isovalerate, total BCFA, @sm$ phenol @/sm$, 4-ethylphenol, total @sm$ phenol @/sm$, indole, and total @sm$ phenol @/sm$ and indole concentrations (Fig.	1
Additionally, we discovered that 9 serum metabolites, including TCDCA, GCDCA, and @sm$ xanthine @/sm$, were closely related to the previously screened key species @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ and Ruminococcus bicirculans and that the KGMSM panel constructed from the 9 differential metabolites associated with the key species has some diagnostic potential. The Spearman correlation test showed that ouabain, TCDCA, GCDCA, and @sm$ xanthine @/sm$ all had significant negative correlations with @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ and Ruminococcus bicirculans.	3
After HFD supplemented with annatto-extracted tocotrienol treatment, the attenuation of WAT-derived IL-6 in mice could decrease the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and the abundance of Ruminococcus lactaris, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, and Lachnospiraceae family. WAT-originated IL-6 can also increase the permeability of intestinal barrier, aggravating @sm$ LPS @/sm$-induced endotoxemia.	3
After LAE treatment at 1 x MIC, the percentage of bisoxonol-positive @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ and Lactobacillus plantarum cells were increased to 1.8 and 0.3%, respectively, significantly higher than that of the control cells (0.6 and 0.1%, respectively), suggesting the depolarization of the membrane. The percentages of @sm$ propidium iodide @/sm$-positive @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ and L.	3
After a 4 h-induction of the bacteria in GMM, the @sm$ NO2- @/sm$ production was measured in the bacterial culture supernatants. Consistent with the microarray and RT-qPCR results, significant production of @sm$ NO2- @/sm$ was observed in the @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ wild-type strain with a mean nitrite concentration of 698.5 +- 6.5 muM, as compared to its Deltarsh isogenic mutant with a strongly reduced nitrite concentration of only 40.2 +- 6.4 muM.	1
After constructing the butanoate metabolism and benzoate degradation pathways of @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, it can be seen from Figure 6A that @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ had five enzymes in the butyrate metabolism pathway that generated methyl butyrate from @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$, among which EC: 2.8.3.8, EC: 4.2.1.17, EC: 1.1. 1.157, and EC: 2.3.1.9 were all annotated, and only EC: 1.3.1.44 and EC: 1.1.1.86 were not annotated. The pathway integrity was 80%, and we speculate that they could cooperate with other bacteria to produce butyric acid. At the same time, six enzymes in the metabolic pathway generated @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ from 3-Oxopimeloyl-CoA, among which EC: 2.3.1.16, EC: 7.2.4.5, EC: 4.2.1.17, EC: 1.1.1.157, and EC: 2.3.1.9 were all annotated, and only EC: 1.3.99.32 was not annotated.	1
After eight weeks, there was a significant increase in the amount of Roseburia faecis and @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ in the MD compared to the Western diet. Moreover, the amount of Akkermansia muciniphila increased in the MD group. The MD lowered plasma arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA). In this mechanism, MD may show anti-inflammatory effects by increasing the tightness of the intestinal barrier. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was negatively correlated with serum @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ concentration in patients with atrial fibrillation.	0
After overnight incubation, colonies that exhibited characteristics of Salmonella and @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species were identified by conventional biochemical methods. Because of many enteric bacteria can also grow in the enrichment broth, further detection techniques were performed to ensure specific isolation of E. coli colonies. Suspicious colonies were transferred to Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar, tryptone broth, arabinose broth, and urea broth and incubated for 20 h at 35  C. Then @sm$ H2S @/sm$-positive, urease-positive, arabinose non-fermenting and indole-negative strains were rejected. Both E. coli and @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ are anaerogenic (i.e. produce little or no gas) and non-motile, therefore to differentiate E. coli from @gm$ Shigella @/gm$, slow lactose fermenters were examined for lysine decarboxylase, mucate, and acetate reactions. @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ was characterized based on a negative indole reaction and slow or non-fermentation of lactose.	0
After recovery, we detected two ARGs that bloomed significantly and exclusively in the probiotics group (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.005, effect size = 1.7 for both): axyY, which encodes a resistance-nodulation-cell division multi-drug efflux pump associated with resistance to cephalosporin, macrolide, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics, and vanSD, a glycopeptide resistance gene cluster that has been reported in @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium. In this study, vanSD expansion correlated with the bloom of several Blautia species (Spearman's P < 0.0001, r = 0.79-0.82 for all), including @gm$ Blautia coccoides @/gm$, Blautia hominis and Blautia producta (Fig. 5e). Extracting all the reads assigned by ShortBRED to this ARG and aligning them to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database using BLASTX indicated that 54.1% of the reads were specifically mapped to B. producta. Thus, in two distinct mammalian species, post-antibiotics probiotic supplementation was associated with expansion of the resistome in the GI tract. Interestingly, ARGs associated with @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ resistance bloomed in both mice and humans and likely stem from bacterial species that proliferate despite probiotic inhibition of microbiome recovery, rather than from the probiotic supplement itself.	4
After rinsing with @sm$ water @/sm$, the teeth were placed in acrylic resin (Citofix Kit, Struers A/@gm$ S, Ballerup @/gm$, Denmark) and then sectioned buccolingually using a diamond cutting saw (Minitom, Struers A/@gm$ S, Ballerup @/gm$, Denmark) operating at a speed of 125 rpm with an applied load of 100 g in 2-3 sections.	0
After this time, a few drops of liquid culture were spread onto the surface of Willis-Hobbs agar (10 g/L of peptic digest of animal tissue, 10 g/L of meat extract, 5 g/L of sodium chloride, 12 g/L of @sm$ lactose @/sm$, 0.032 g/L of neutral red, 12 mL of egg yolk emulsion, and 10 g/L of agar with a final pH of 7.0 +-0.2) at 25 C and incubated anaerobically at 37 C for 48 h. Aerobic control of each sample was provided. Simultaneously, the @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ spp.	2
After transposition, there is only one IS629 left in @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$. IS629 insertion is highly biased toward prophages and prophage-like integrative elements. Both IS629 and IS602 are not present in O104:H7 and O104:H21 but exist in all @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ strains (Table 1). IS602 also appears to be part of @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ (and related aminoglycosides) resistance transposons. In addition, @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$-specific CRISPR2 was not found in any of the other STEC strains examined in this study (Table 1), including O104:H7 and O104:H21. The presence and the functions of CRISPR2 may play a significant role in @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ for maintaining a high degree of genomic plasticity and flexibility for adapting to host and environmental changes. Analysis of IS629 and CRISPR distribution among O104 strains might be useful for identification and detection of specific O104 strains and population genetic analysis, as well as molecular epidemiology studies. The presence of IS629, CRISPR, and prophage regions (data not shown) may potentially contribute to the larger genome size of @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Figure 1).	4
After treatment with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ for 12 h, HT-29 cells were washed three times with normal saline. The cells then were incubated for 1h with @sm$ FITC @/sm$ labeled lectin solution(1:1000dilution), which containing the alpha-1,2-fucose specific lectin ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) and GlcNAc specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA).	0
After we confirmed the enzymatic activity of IH using the beta-glucosidase activity assay, bioconversion of isoflavone glycoside into aglycone forms was evaluated using three isoflavone glycosides (genistin, @sm$ daidzin @/sm$, and glycitin) which are major isoflavones in soybean (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B-D, for genistin, @sm$ daidzin @/sm$, and glycitin, we found a high conversion yield of glycoside into aglycone forms in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH. First, contrary to the result of beta-glucosidase activity observed in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ wild type, bioconversion of isoflavone was not observed in wild type strain (Figure 4B-D). Therefore, it was confirmed that intrinsic beta-glucosidases in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ CB2567 did not have substrate specificity for isoflavone glycoside forms. Meanwhile, @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH showed the highest activity for genistin among three examined substrates: 22.1 microM of genistein (aglycone form) was produced from 23.1 microM of genistin (100 mg/L) (glycoside form), with a conversion rate of 2.7 microM/h and a yield of 95% (0.95 mol/mol) at 8 h in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH (Figure 4B). Next, for 24 microM of @sm$ daidzin @/sm$ (100 mg/L) (glycoside form), 20.5 microM of daidzein (aglycone form) was produced, with a conversion rate of 1.2 microM/h and a yield of 85% (0.85 mol/mol) at 16 h (Figure 4C). Finally, in the case of glycitin substrate, it was found that 15.8 microM of glycitein (aglycone form) was produced from 22.4 microM of glycitin (100 mg/L), with a conversion rate of 0.6 microM/h and a yield of 70% (0.70 mol/mol) at 24 h (Figure 4D). These results clearly confirmed that the engineered @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ had a highly efficient bioconversion property to convert all the isoflavone glycoside forms into aglycone forms.	2
Afterwards, 500 muL of the L1 larvae solution (~ 250 L1 larvae), plus 100 muL of nutrient medium (lyophilized @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, yeast extract and amphotericin B 0.49 microg/mL) and 600 muL of the treatment (cinnamaldehyde, @sm$ citronellal @/sm$ or geraniol) were added to two grams of feces (from parasite-free animals).	3
"AgNP-antibiotic synergy with potential for clinical applications on MDR pathogens: A recently published seminal study used @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ to produce biogenic AgNPs and test their antibacterial efficacy on carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (CPGB) alone and conjugated to various antibiotics. The study found potent antimicrobial activity against CPGB, with MICs ranging from 64 to 8 mug mL-1. Among the conjugates, AgNP-ceftriaxone showed the highest synergistic effect with the MIC lowered by 250-fold (from 1024 mug mL-1 to 4 mug mL-1) against @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$. This result is significant because carbapenems are considered the ""last resort"" option, while beta-lactams are often the go-to first line of treatment against severe bacterial infections. Hence, developing new treatment options against carbapenem-resistant bacteria is imperative. Post-surgical ointments: Biogenic AgNPs were produced by reduction of @sm$ Ag+ @/sm$ with extracts of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum."	1
AgNPs exhibited an amazing biocidal activity on a wide range of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, including foodborne pathogens such as @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and Staphylococcus aureus. The suggested mechanism behind AgNPs's actions includes their induction of cell death through generation of @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$) in some bacteria including E.	3
Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of lomefloxacin (LO), ciprofloxacin (CI), and @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ (@sm$ ER @/sm$) were determined for 100 clinical isolates of Legionella using buffered charcoal yeast extract medium supplemented with alpha-ketoglutarate (BCYEa). The Legionella strains tested included 84 L. pneumophila, 2 L. micdadei, 6 L. dumoffii, 4 L. longbeachae, and one each of @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$, L. hackeliae, L. wadsworthii, and L. maceachernii. Geometric mean MICs microgram/ml were 0.56 for LO, 0.50 for CI, and 0.25 for @sm$ ER @/sm$. Ninety percent MICs were 1.0 for LO and CI, and 0.5 for @sm$ ER @/sm$. All Legionella strains except one (L. hackeliae) were inhibited by 1.0 microgram/ml of LO or CI; this strain had an Er MIC of 1.0 microgram/ml and was inhibited by 2.0 micrograms/ml of LO or CI. Control strains of Eschershia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were also tested on both BCYEa and Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) to determine BCYEa-mediated inhibition of the antimicrobials. All three antimicrobials were inactivated in varying degrees by BCYEa. BCYEa:MHA MICs of the S. aureus control strain were 4:1 for LO and @sm$ ER @/sm$, and greater than 4:1 for CI. BCYEa: MHA MICs of the E. coli control strain were 4:1 for LO and CI, and unmeasurable for @sm$ ER @/sm$. Both LO and CI have good in vitro activity against legionella, probably greater than that measured in this study because of antimicrobial inactivation by BCYEa. Since LO is concentrated by phagocytic cells, like @sm$ ER @/sm$ and CI, it is likely that it will be effective in the treatment of Legionnaires' disease.	3
Age, food intake, genetic variations in APAP-metabolizing enzymes, and concurrent @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ consumption have all been linked to different clinical outcomes after an APAP overdose. Alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to liver diseases. Diurnal differences in gut microbiota abundance and composition have been linked to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity susceptibility. However, the gut microbiota produces thousands of tiny, chemically varied compounds, most of which have unclear biological activities and molecular mechanisms. According to our 16s sequencing data with intestinal contents samples, we found that the percentage of community abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Oscillibacter and Colidextribacter decreased in the OEB pretreatment group compared with that in the APAP group, and that Akkermansia and @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ increased on the genus level (Figure 7B). Studies have shown that these gut microbiotas relate to lipid transport and metabolism. @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ alleviates obesity and metabolic dysfunctions via production of succinate and secondary bile acids . Akkermansia has been found to be lower in several conditions (obesity, diabetes, intestinal inflammation, liver diseases, or chronic @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ consumption) and this is associated with an altered gut barrier function leading to an increased plasma LPS levels and eventually triggering low grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. In our data, OEB pretreatment did regulate lipid metabolism (Figure 6). Overall, these observations suggest that OEB regulated lipid metabolism through increasing the abundance of Akkermansia and @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$.	1
Aim of the present study was to assess the evolution and the factors associated with resistance in Prevotella species to penicillin, @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$, metronidazole, tetracycline and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLIs). In total, 192 @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ strains, isolated from patients with oral and head-and-neck infections, were evaluated. Common isolates were Prevotella intermedia and @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ within the pigmented species as well as Prevotella oris and Prevotella oralis group within the non-pigmented species. Overall resistance was 43.2% for penicillin, 10.9% for @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$, 0% for metronidazole. Nonsusceptibility to tetracycline was 29.1% without significant differences in resistance rates between pigmented and other species. Penicillin resistant strains were beta-lactamase positive. From 2003-2004 to 2007-2009, penicillin resistance rates increased about four-fold (from 15.4% to 60.6%). @sm$ Clindamycin @/sm$ resistance did not show evolution, whereas tetracycline nonsusceptibility decreased from 43.3% in 2003-2004 to 20.7% in 2007-2009. Except for one (0.5%) P. oralis strain with intermediate susceptibility to BL/BLIs, the other strains were susceptible to the agents. In conclusion, in @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ strains from patients with head-and-neck infections, the resistance rate to penicillin increased, that to @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$ remained stable and the nonsusceptibility rate to tetracycline decreased during the period. Activity against >99% of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ strains was observed with metronidazole and BL/BLIs. The penicillin resistance and tetracycline nonsusceptibility were associated with the year of study, national antibiotic consumption and possibly with previous treatment (for tetracycline). The evolution of penicillin resistance in @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ strains was highly dynamic.	4
Akkermansia is a bacterium that degrades mucins, producing acetate, propionate and small @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$-containing molecules. Non-mucin-degrading bacteria utilise carbon and @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ sources provided by Akkermansia, promoting their own growth and colonisation. It has been reported that cocultured Akkermansia and non-mucin-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Roseburia and Eubacterium hallii, can mutually promote growth and butyrate production.	2
Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 were significantly enriched at D = 0.05 1/h, while @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$, Lachnospiraceae unclassified and Escherichia coli clearly preferred D = 0.2 1/h. In the chemostat cultures, the production of organic acids and gases from pectin was related to the dilution rate. The ratio of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and butyrate was 5:2:1 (D = 0.05 1/h) and 14:2:1 (D = 0.2 1/h).	1
Akkermansia muciniphila is a key player in propionate production from mucin, while Lachnospiraceae, @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$, and Roseburia inulinivorans are responsible for the degradation of deoxy sugars (e.g., @sm$ fucose @/sm$, rhamnose) and hexoses by Bacteroidetes and Negativicutes sp.	2
Akkermansia municiphila has been linked to formation of the @sm$ lipids @/sm$ 2-arachidonolyglycerl and 2-oleoylglycerol, which reduce inflammation and improve gut barrier function. Lastly, quercetin (Table 1) has been shown to improve gut dysbiosis in rats fed high fat diets, inhibiting the growth of bacteria linked to obesity (e.g., Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacillus spp., @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$).	0
Alistipes, Ruminiclostridium 5, Klebsiella, and the @gm$ [Eubacterium] ventriosum @/gm$ group had the highest correlation with gut microbiota as they had the largest numbers and lithocholic acid. @sm$ 4-methylphenol @/sm$, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, N-acetylornithine, and benzotriazole were the most correlated metabolites.	0
All 11 isolates were able to ferment ribose, galactose, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, fructose, mannose, n-acetyl-glucosamine, esculin, salicin, cellobiose and gentiobiose. Three different LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$) were identified using the API 50 CHL system and 16S rDNA analysis. Identification of Kp10 as @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2).	2
All 34 ESBL-producing @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; 28 strains were resistant to cefepime and ceftazidime, and 13 to ciprofloxacin. All 34 ESBL-producing @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ strains were sensitive to cefoxitin, @sm$ imipenem @/sm$ and gentamicin.	3
All @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$ strains are derivatives of PaW85, which is isogenic to KT2440. P. aeruginosa PAO1 subline PAO1-L, stored originally at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (Dieter Haas collection) was obtained in 2013 from AP Stephan Heeb, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. P. aeruginosa and E. coli were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ was grown in LB or in M9 medium supplemented with casamino acids (CAA) and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ at final concentrations of 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. Minimal solid medium was M9 supplemented with @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and contained 1.5% Difco agar. LB solid medium for Rifr mutation assay contained 1.5% Difco agar and rifampicin at 100 mug/ml. Other antibiotics were added at following concentrations: ampicillin at 100 mug/ml, kanamycin at 50-500 mug/ml, streptomycin at 200 mug/ml, benzylpenicillin at 1500 mug/ml and carbenicillin at 200-500 mug/ml. Bacteria were incubated on agar plates or in liquid cultures with shaking (180 rpm): P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 37 C and @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ at 30 C, if not specified otherwise. P. aeruginosa, @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ and E.	2
All @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi @/gm$ isolates were sensitive to third generation cephalosporins, chloramphenicol and @sm$ imipenem @/sm$.	3
All KEGG organisms from genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Flavonifractor, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, Dorea and Coprococcus, which showed the top three positive or negative correlations with faecal carbohydrates in Fig. 2d, were selected for this analysis. The lists of genes involving the 'starch and @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ metabolism' pathway (00500) in these KEGG organisms were extracted using the R package KEGGREST (v.1.32.0). The representative protein sequences of @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ strain 2789STDY5608857 (taxonomy ID 53443), Dorea longicatena strain 2789STDY5608851 (taxonomy ID 88431) and Dorea formicigenerans strain ATCC 27755 (taxonomy ID 411461) were downloaded from the NCBI Datasets (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/). KEGG annotation of these protein sequence files was performed using BlastKOALA (https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) with 'Bacteria' used as the taxonomy group. The presence of KEGG orthologues relating to extracellular glycoside hydrolases in starch and @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ metabolism pathways shown in grey in Extended Data Fig.	2
All KEGG organisms from genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Flavonifractor, Blautia, Dorea and @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, which showed the top three positive or negative correlations with faecal carbohydrates in Fig. 2d, were selected for this analysis. The lists of genes involving the '@sm$ starch @/sm$ and sucrose metabolism' pathway (00500) in these KEGG organisms were extracted using the R package KEGGREST (v.1.32.0). The representative protein sequences of Blautia hydrogenotrophica strain 2789STDY5608857 (taxonomy ID 53443), Dorea longicatena strain 2789STDY5608851 (taxonomy ID 88431) and Dorea formicigenerans strain ATCC 27755 (taxonomy ID 411461) were downloaded from the NCBI Datasets (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/). KEGG annotation of these protein sequence files was performed using BlastKOALA (https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) with 'Bacteria' used as the taxonomy group.

All but @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ and Campylobacter showae are capable of fermenting carbohydrates to acid, although @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and C. showae can produce @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and or succinate with formate and fumarate in the culture medium.	1
All compositional analyses and the @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ bioassay were carried out on purified cell wall, which was prepared following a procedure adapted from. For each sample, approx. 1 g of ground plant biomass was extracted sequentially as follows: with 30 mL ethanol, first for 12 h and then twice more for 30 min in a shaking incubator set at 40  C/150 r.p.m.; three times with 20 mL chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v), for 30 min incubation at 25  C and 150 r.p.m.; and finally, three times with 15 mL @sm$ acetone @/sm$, for 30 min, at 25  C/150 r.p.m. Between each step of the extraction, the material was collected by centrifugation at 887 g/10 min and the supernatants were discarded. Following the third @sm$ acetone @/sm$ step, the samples were left to dry overnight in a fume hood. The dried, solvent-extracted biomass was then re-suspended in 15 mL of 0 1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5 0) and heated to 80  C/20 min to induce starch gelatinization followed by cooling on ice. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged and supernatants were discarded, after which the resulting pellet was washed twice with 30 mL deionized water, with resuspension, centrifugation and supernatant removal being performed for each wash. Sodium azide was added at 0 0002 % (w/v) to inhibit microbial growth, and starch was removed by incubation with type-I porcine alpha-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA; 47 units per 100 mg cell wall) in 0 1 m ammonium formate buffer (pH 6 0) at 25  C/110 r.p.m. After 48 h, digestion was terminated by heating to 95  C/15 min and samples were cooled on ice. The destarched cell-wall preparations were then washed three times in 30 mL deionized water and twice with 20 mL @sm$ acetone @/sm$, with centrifugation and supernatant removal, before being freeze-dried.	0
All experiments were performed in the absence of endotoxin (@sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$) contamination and under non-toxic conditions (data not shown), the latter being evaluated by the lactate dehydrogenase release with the CytoTox 96  Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Since the P1/7Deltalmb mutant strain did not grow in the RPMI-1640 complete medium, heat-killed @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ suspensions (prepared as previously described) of all tested strains were used for bmDC stimulation at a concentration equivalent to 2 x 109 CFU/mL. Cells were resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL in complete medium and stimulated with the different heat-killed @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ strains. Supernatants were collected at 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 16 h following stimulation with heat-kill @gm$ S. suis @/gm$, incubation times at which secreted cytokine levels were maximal in the absence of cytotoxicity (data not shown).	0
All experiments were performed on the @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ strain NZ9000 DeltalmrR. NZ9000 is a @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ MG1363 strain derivative containing the pepN::nisR/K substitution, which in the presence of the inducer, nisin A, switches on the expression of genes from the nisA promoter. By using the pNZ8048 vector housing the nisA promoter, pNZ8048-lmrR was constructed. The strain NZ9000 DeltalmrR lacks a chromosomal copy of the lmrR gene and served as a control. Both NZ9000 DeltalmrR strain and the plasmid pNZ8048-lmrR were provided by Prof. Arnold Driessen (University of Groningen). For the construction of nisin A-inducible plasmids for ramR, we cloned the native ramR gene into a pNZC3GH vector harboring a nisin A-inducible nisA promoter. However, we failed to observe any protein expression with this construct, which possibly arose because of codon-mismatch from the GC-rich native ramR sequence (Appendix 3). Next, we codon-optimized the ramR gene for @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ using the graphical codon usage analyzer tool and synthesized the ramR gene fragment (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany). The amplification of the ramR gene and corresponding plasmid pNZC3GH backbone for USER based cloning was performed using forward and reverse primers that added a @sm$ uracil @/sm$ residue instead of a thymine residue at flanking regions. The resulting plasmid pNZC3GH-ramR was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics Germany GmbH) and transformed into the @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ strain NZ9000 DeltalmrR by electroporation.	0
All health care providers were required to use contact precautions and soap and water hand washing before and after any contact with @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ positive patients. Contact precautions included the use of gowns and gloves with any contact with a presumed or confirmed CDI case. Further, a water-based scrub was required for the first surgical case of the day instead of the previously used @sm$ alcohol @/sm$-based scrub.	3
All isolates corresponding to Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas spp., and @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. were tested against a panel of 13 antibiotics using the disk diffusion Kirby-Bauer method following CLSI guidelines in the M100 and VET01S. Antibiotics tested included amikacin (AMK, 30 mug); ampicillin (AMP, 10 mug); amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AUG 20/10 mug); @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ (@sm$ CAZ @/sm$, 30 mug); ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 mug); ceftriaxone (CRO, 30 mug); doxycycline (DXT, 30 mug); enrofloxacin (ENR, 5 mug); ertapenem (ETP, 10 mug); gentamicin (GEN, 10 mug); imipenem (IPM, 10 mug); ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM, 10/10 mug); and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 1.25/23.75 mug). All of these were supplied by OXOID (Hampshire, UK). The AMP disc was not used for Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp. In addition, for @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp.	0

All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, moxifloxacin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, gentamicin, linezolid, vancomycin and @sm$ daptomycin @/sm$. Five isolates (24 %) were concomitantly non-susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline, and harboured the tet(O) and erm(B) genes; for one isolate, lsa(E) and lnu(B) were additionally detected. @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ isolated in Poland from human invasive infections belongs to a globally distributed clonal complex of this pathogen, enriched in virulence markers. This is the first report of the lsa(E) and lnu(B) resistance genes in @gm$ S. suis @/gm$.	3
All of the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ strains used in this study were derived from C6706str2, a streptomycin-resistant isolate of C6706 (O1 El Tor). E. coli S17-1 lambdapir was used as a host for plasmids for mating into @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ and for E. coli GFP assays. All of the strains used in this study are described in Table S1 in the supplemental material. @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ and E. coli cultures were grown overnight with aeration in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 30 C. Cell viability assays were carried out in static culture at 30 C in 1x M9 medium (25.2 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 8.56 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2) with 0.2% Casamino acids. As a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source, 0.5% glucose, 0.5% GlcNAc, or 0.5% glycerol was added.	2
All of the isolates were susceptible to @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$, colistin and carbapenems. Phenotypic identification using the double disk synergy test, ampC disk test and carba NP test revealed that 102 (43.5%) of the isolated strains were ampC beta-lactamase producers, 67 (28.5%) were ESBL producers, and 48 (20.5%) were co-producers of ESBL and ampC beta-lactamases. Both ESBL and ESBL/ampC production were detected in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. fergusonii, and @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ (Table 2), whereas only AmpC production was detected in E.	3
All of the selected bacteria are recognized @sm$ lactate @/sm$ oxidisers that are either unable to (Acetobacterium woodii) or able to synthesize butyrate (Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium diolis, Clostridium kluyveri, @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$). The genomes of the analysed species capable of transforming @sm$ lactate @/sm$ into butyrate encode at least two different EtfA/EtfB proteins and these genes are found in different genetic contexts (data not shown), similarly to those shown for C butyricum in Fig.	2
All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, @sm$ cefadroxil @/sm$ less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.	3
All other tested reactions were negative, notably nitrate reduction, @sm$ indole @/sm$ formation, urease, arginine dihydrolase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase, 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase, arginine arylamidase, proline arylamidase, phenylalanine arylamidase, leucine arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, tyrosine arylamidase, glycine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase, serine arylamidase, and mannose and raffinose fermentation. Using the Api Zym system (BioMerieux), esterase, esterase lipase, acid phosphatase, Naphtol-AS-BI phosphohydrolase and alpha-galactosidase activities were positive. A. obesi is susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin and rifampicin, but resistant to penicillin G, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin 15 and gentamycin 500, doxycycline, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. By comparison with A. senegalensis, A. obesi differed in motility, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, @sm$ indole @/sm$ production, beta-glucuronidase, arginine arylamidase, glycine arylamidase, proline arylamidase and mannose fermentation. By comparison with A. timonensis, A. obesi differed in motility, @sm$ indole @/sm$ production, beta-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. By comparison with @gm$ A.putredinis @/gm$, A.obesi differed in motility, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and @sm$ indole @/sm$ production. By comparison with A.finegoldii, A.obesi differed in catalase, alpha-glucosidase and @sm$ indole @/sm$ production. Finally, A. obesidiffered in @sm$ indole @/sm$ production, catalase, esterase, esterase lipase and alpha-glucosidase with A.	1
All prepared compounds, including the starting acid and ester that lack the urea moiety, were screened for in vitro activity against Mtb H37Rv, @gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$ (@gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$) and Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) using a Microplate @sm$ Alamar Blue @/sm$ Assay.	3
"All sequenced genomes encode maltose/maltodextrin ABC transporters, while @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and S. equinus also appear to encode ABC transporters for multiple sugars (the so-called MSM system). These transporters have been previously described for S. mutans and can import multiple sugars, including raffinose and @sm$ melibiose @/sm$. Notably, the @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and S. equinus strains, also encode the downstream enzymes required for raffinose and @sm$ melibiose @/sm$ metabolism. Finally, the S. equinus genome also contained genes encoding an ""alpha-arabinosides ABC transport permease (araP)"" as well as the necessary enzymes to metabolize this sugar. These findings are in excellent agreement with the observation that only S. equinus was able to grow on arabinose, while only @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and S. equinus could ferment @sm$ melibiose @/sm$ and grow on raffinose."	2
All six isolates were identified as @gm$ S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus @/gm$ using biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Supplementary materials, Table S1, Figure S1). Using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI, the MICs of these isolates were determined using ATCC 43144 and ATCC 29213 as controls. MICs of penicillin, @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$ and vancomycin for all isolates were smaller than individual breakpoints, indicating susceptible or intermediate category of all six isolates to these antibiotics (Table 1). While some isolates demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol (2/6), levofloxacin (4/6) and gentamicin (3/6), all isolates were resistant to tetracycline (MIC = 25 mg/L (2/6), or >128 mg/L (4/6)), and to lincomycin (MIC >= 128 mg/L). Interestingly, all isolates were highly resistant to both erythromycin (MIC >= 1024 mg/L) and clarithromycin (MIC = 512 mg/L) (Table 1). The data indicated that all @gm$ S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus @/gm$ isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR) and exhibited high macrolide resistance.	3
All strains of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$ which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals.	4
All tested antibiotics according to their chemical structure were divided into seven groups: aminoglycosides (AMG) (gentamycin, neomycin, streptomycin), beta-lactams (LA) (amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin), chloramphenicols (CHL) (chloramphenicol), lincosamides (LIN) (clindamycin), macrolides (MAC) (erythromycin), fluoroquinolones (FLU) (ciprofloxacin) and tetracyclines (TET) (tetracycline, @sm$ oxytetracycline @/sm$) (Reinthaler et al.). Isolated @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ strains were also analyzed for the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) according to Mudryk et al..	0
All the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to @gm$ S. bovis biotype II/2 @/gm$ (@sm$ mannitol @/sm$ negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). The API 20 Strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as @gm$ S. bovis biotype II/2 @/gm$, those of cluster 1 as S. bovis biotype II/1, and that of cluster 2a as S. bovis biotype I. There was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: @gm$ S. bovis biotype II/2 @/gm$ isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the S.	0
Alloprevotella can produce SCFAs, mainly succinate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$, which could improve the intestinal epithelial barrier and prevent inflammation. @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ provides energy to colonic epithelial cells and has the ability to promote the proliferation of probiotic bacteria, alleviate inflammation and maintain intestinal health.	1
Almost all GPAC isolates are susceptible to @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ (as in our study) even if some resistant strains have been described. Indeed, reduced susceptibility to @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ has so far only been rarely detected in surveillance studies among some P. micra, F. magna, and Peptostreptococcus spp. isolates. Several molecular mechanisms have been associated with @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ resistance, mainly in Bacteroides fragilis. It is mainly related to drug inactivation by nitroimidazole reductase encoded by nim genes. To date, 11 nim genes (nimA to nimK) sharing between 54 and 90% amino acid identities have been described. Of them, only nimB genes have been identified in the chromosome of some GPAC isolates (P. anaerobius, @gm$ A. prevotii @/gm$, P. micra). Note that the nimB gene was detected in 34% (21/61) of GPAC isolates with MIC of @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ >=0.5 mg/L, including only two highly resistant F. magna isolates (MIC > 128 mg/L) while the other 19 strains remained susceptible. Since @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ is often the drug used for empirical treatment of anaerobic infections and some resistant GPAC clinical isolates have been described, microbiologists should verify the activity of this antibiotic if necessary.	3
Almost all the EPS producers carried one or more genes (epsD/E and/or epsA) involved in the production of heteropolysaccharides (HePS), whereas the isolates ascribed to @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ and W. confusa carried genes involved in the production of both HePS and homopolysaccharides (HoPS). Monosaccharide composition analysis of the EPS produced by a selected subset of isolates revealed that all the HePS included glucose, mannose, and @sm$ galactose @/sm$, though at different ratios. Furthermore, a few isolates ascribed to @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ and W.	1
Also, greater amounts of indolyl-3-acetic acid and indolyl-lactate were found in the urine and indole and @sm$ 3-methylindole @/sm$ in the faeces of autistic children. Following species produce indoles: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Paracolobactrum coliform, Achromobacter liguefaciens, Bacteroides spp and @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ spp.	1
Also, it should be mentioned that metabolic cross-feeding, which is the utilisation of end-products from the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ catabolism of a given microorganism by another, also strongly influences the final balance of intestinal SCFAs. This occurs mainly for the formation of butyrate from acetate or lactate, is considerably lower for butyrate conversion to propionate, and is very scarce between propionate and acetate. An increase of propionate is related to an enrichment of intestinal Bacteroidetes/@gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$. It was published that modifying microbiota with antibiotics in mice led to a strong correlation between caecum levels of SCFAs and the abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and other members of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Also, SCFAs and OAs formed in cultures of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ (acetate, succinate, lactate, and propionate) depend on the type of fermentable substrates, generation time and incubation period. In this study, a significant increase in acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids in caecum samples from the MCFAs group could be related to the above-mentioned acids produced by dominant bacteria, as the main differences among in the OAs and MCFAs groups regarding Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (which was more abundant in the OA group) and @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Papillibacter and Blautia (which was more abundant in the MCFAs group) were established. Two @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species (B. ovatus and @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$) were among the most prevalent species in the MCFAs group compared with the OAs group.	2
Also, the inoculation of @sm$ dapagliflozin @/sm$ (@sm$ DAPA @/sm$) in adult human subjects (12-21 years old) could help in controlling glycemic levels by reducing the required amount of inulin in the blood. @sm$ DAPA @/sm$ is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor that acts by inhibiting SGLT-2 in the proximal tubule of kidneys. This decreases the reabsorption of glucose thereby increasing the secretion of glucose in urine, and has been found to increase the intestinal population of segmented filamentous bacteria, i.e., @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$, thereby providing protection against autoimmune T1D disease, as mentioned in Table 1.	3
Also, the suppression of NF-kappaB is in line with the bacterial load, so it can be concluded that both @sm$ Quercetin @/sm$ and Miana only have bacteriostatic and not bactericidal effects. Here clearly shows that both @sm$ Quercetin @/sm$ and Miana are used as a supplement in infections caused by @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$. The results of this study indicate that @sm$ Quercetin @/sm$ and Miana used as potential anti-inflammatory in @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ infection by suppressing NF-kappaB activity. Miana shown to prevent the growth of Candida albicans, M. tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ in vitro. All of these studies came to the same conclusions as our study, which concluded that Miana has bacteriostatic effects alone and no bactericidal ones. @sm$ Quercetin @/sm$ and Miana can therefore be added to existing treatments for @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ infection.	3
Alternan was produced from sucrose using alternansucrase derived from @gm$ Le. citreum @/gm$ ABK-01 (GenBank accession number KM083061.2). Briefly, one unit per milliliter of alternansucrase was incubated with 20% (w/v) sucrose in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37  C overnight. The polymer was harvested by @sm$ acetone @/sm$ precipitation.	1
Alternative electron acceptors, for example @sm$ sulphate @/sm$ (SO42- + 4H2 + H+   HS- + 4H2O,  G = - 234 kJ), nitrate (NO3- + H2   NO2- + H2O,  G = - 161 kJ) and nitrite (NO2- + 3 H2 + 2 H+   NH4+  + 2H2O,  G = - 519 kJ) are thermodynamically more favourable than methanogenesis (CO2 + 4 H2   CH4 + 2 H2O,  G = - 134 kJ). This makes @sm$ sulphate- @/sm$reducing bacteria (SRB) and nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) effective in H competition with methanogens, when sufficient substrate is present. Both SRB and NRB were detected in the choline supplemented treatments (Fig. 6). Predicted SRB include M. elsdenii, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp., Alkaliphilus spp., Prevotella bryantii, Proteus mirabilis and Lachnotalea spp.	2
Although @sm$ nickel @/sm$ is essential for both @sm$ nickel @/sm$ containing hydrogenases in @gm$ Cf @/gm$, it is also toxic in excessive amounts, potentially causing oxidative stress and perturbing enzyme activities. One mechanism of modulating @sm$ nickel @/sm$ levels that was previously identified in E. coli is the @sm$ nickel @/sm$ defense system (RcnA), which utilizes a proton gradient to translocate @sm$ nickel @/sm$ to the periplasm where it can either be bound by sequestering proteins or effluxed from the cell. We observed a 50-fold increase in a metal P-type ATPase in pglX- (A0RQS6), annotated as copper/cadmium-translocating P-type ATPase with similarly predicted activities. These metal P-type ATPase translocators are involved in detoxification of metals by transporting metals across the inner membrane. It is possible that this P-type metal translocator may be deficient at translocating; however, there is no clear link to N-glycosylation. These data are consistent with the cellular @sm$ nickel @/sm$ levels of the pglX- strain, which were 6-times higher than the pglJ- strain. These increased @sm$ nickel @/sm$ levels may be responsible for the higher hydrogenase activity levels measured in pglX- compared to the other two strains, while @sm$ nickel @/sm$ toxicity could explain the decreased growth in H2 growth assays. Our data indicate that N-glycosylation regulates (NiFe)-hydrogenases HynABC, correlating with cellular @sm$ nickel @/sm$ levels.	3
Although Firmicutes have fewer genes encoding CAZymes, they encode more ABC transporters, @sm$ phosphoenolpyruvate @/sm$, carbohydrate PTS transporters, major facilitator superfamily transporters and glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide transporters to transport carbohydrates. The multienzyme complexes system can efficiently degrade cellulose or resistant starch by interacting with dockerins and cohesins domains. This system has been found in @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ in human feces; dockerin is a small domain found in enzyme components and cohesin is a beta-sandwich domain found in non-catalytic scaffold proteins that provides carbohydrate binding and/or cell wall anchoring functions.	2
Although Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) and @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi A @/gm$ (@gm$ SPA @/gm$) belong to the same phylogenetic species, share large portions of their genome and express many common virulence factors, they differ vastly in their host specificity, the immune response they elicit, and the clinical manifestations they cause. In this work, we compared their intracellular transcriptomic architecture and cellular phenotypes during human epithelial cell infection. While transcription induction of many metal transport systems, purines, biotin, PhoPQ and SPI-2 regulons was similar in both intracellular @gm$ SPA @/gm$ and STM, we identified 234 differentially expressed genes that showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular @gm$ SPA @/gm$ vs. STM. Surprisingly, clear expression differences were found in SPI-1, motility and chemotaxis, and carbon (mainly citrate, galactonate and @sm$ ethanolamine @/sm$) utilization pathways, indicating that these pathways are regulated differently during their intracellular phase. Concurring, on the cellular level, we show that while the majority of STM are non-motile and reside within @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-Containing Vacuoles (SCV), a significant proportion of intracellular @gm$ SPA @/gm$ cells are motile and compartmentalized in the cytosol. Moreover, we found that the elevated expression of SPI-1 and motility genes by intracellular @gm$ SPA @/gm$ results in increased invasiveness of @gm$ SPA @/gm$, following exit from host cells. These findings demonstrate unexpected flagellum-dependent intracellular motility of a typhoidal Salmonella serovar and intriguing differences in intracellular localization between typhoidal and non-typhoidal salmonellae. We propose that these differences facilitate new cycles of host cell infection by @gm$ SPA @/gm$ and may contribute to the ability of @gm$ SPA @/gm$ to disseminate beyond the intestinal lamina propria of the human host during enteric fever.	2
Although Tn6164 contained a tet(44) gene, we could not demonstrate increased @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance of strains containing the element. Previously, it has been shown that this gene, present on a homologues resistance island, is active in @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$.	4
Although anaerobic bacteria are generally resistant to @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ antibiotics such as gentamicin and kanamycin, these MICs of @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ were considerably low.	4
Although colonization was not significantly affected by @sm$ PS80 @/sm$, the pathology of the cecum was quantified to determine if there was a difference in severity of disease. Cecum samples were fixed and immobilized in paraffin and thin sections were mounted on slides. followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. These sections were scored blindly for tissue pathology. All animals in the untreated group exhibited inflammation ranging from mild to severe, and in 5/6 animals the inflammation was neutrophilic (Table 2, Fig. 5A). By comparison, only 1/6 animals in the @sm$ PS80 @/sm$ treated group exhibited any inflammation, which was scored as mild and was not neutrophilic (Table 2, Fig. 5A). Moreover, the only two animals that presented tissue necrosis were from the untreated group (A2 and A6), and these two animals exhibited the most severe inflammation, with the severity of inflammation proportional to the severity of necrosis (Table 2). Additional histopathologic findings in the untreated group included dilation of lamina propria lymphatic vessels and submucosal edema in animals with inflammation. The difference of the average in inflammation score between the two treatment groups was statistically significant (Fig 5B). These results indicate that treatment with @sm$ PS80 @/sm$ did not significantly impact colonization levels but did significantly reduce the pathology of infecting @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$.	3
Although direct @sm$ iron @/sm$ supplementation is currently used to alleviate anemia associated with IBD, global @sm$ iron @/sm$ excess often leads to @sm$ iron @/sm$-mediated oxidative stress and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. As demonstrated in the DSS-induced colitis model, the unique abilities of pentanoate to promote @sm$ iron @/sm$ procurement and Treg homeostasis alleviated both iron deficiencies and intestinal inflammation. Pentanoate is produced by intestinal commensal bacteria such as @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$; thus, either direct pentanoate supplementation or modulation of Megasphaera messiliensis could be helpful for improving both the enteric conditions and nonenteric conditions of patients with IBD.	1
Although strain RM4018 is resistant to some quinolones, mutations implicated previously in @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$  and Arcobacter  quinolone resistance at Thr-86, Asp-90 and Ala-70 in the DNA gyrase subunit GyrA are not present in strain RM4018. It is probably not a coincidence that strain RM4018 is susceptible to hydrophilic quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) and resistant to hydrophobic ones (e.g. nalidixic acid and @sm$ oxolinic acid @/sm$).	4
Although the PLS-DA provided discriminant genera on day 13 of life for both feeding groups, such as @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ and Sutterella, respectively, they were low-abundance taxa (<1% of all taxa). The milk replacer did not modify the abundances of the major milk glycan fermenters, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium, and taxa in cross-feeding relationships like Escherichia at least at the genus level. This may be related to, on the one hand, the initially low consumption of the milk replacer and, on the other hand, the ingredients of the milk replacer. It is a limitation of this study that we could not measure the individual creep feed intake due to the production setting and only estimated on a litter basis. The creep feed intake varied among litters, potentially being linked to the milk production of the sow and the suckling behavior of the piglets, which probably added to the variation in the gut microbiome among piglets within and across the respective litters. It is worth looking at the composition of the milk replacer, which contained mainly whey powder (43% DM), hydrolyzed wheat starch (29% DM), soy and plant protein (15%), and coconut and palm oil (8% DM). Although the ingredients from plants probably supported different taxa than milk, the whey powder as the main ingredient, even if of bovine origin, may have supported the proliferation of milk glycan-fermenting taxa. Bovine whey permeate is rich in lactose and milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$, but the @sm$ oligosaccharide @/sm$ profile of bovine milk is different from that of porcine milk. Nevertheless, the high concentration of lactose and specific @sm$ oligosaccharide @/sm$ profile in the milk replacer seemed not to have largely affected the present genera abundances. The PLS-DA identified @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ and Turicibacter as discriminative for creep-fed piglets on days of life 13 and 20, respectively.	2
Although the biofilm-forming ability of enterococci has been widely reported, the optimal culture conditions for @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ and E. faecium biofilm formation are unclear. In the present study, we found that the optimal culture conditions for E. faecalis ATCC 29212 biofilm formation comprised BHI broth with 2% @sm$ GLU @/sm$ incubated at 37 C for 24 h. BHI broth with 2% @sm$ GLU @/sm$ incubated at 25 C for 24 h was the optimal biofilm formation condition for E.	2
Although the effect of @sm$ resveratrol @/sm$ on host metabolism has been shown to be positive, analyses of the plasma concentrations have indicated that @sm$ resveratrol @/sm$ has low bioavailability, as it is too rapidly metabolized to be an effective orally administered medication. Hepatic and gut microbial enzymes can metabolize @sm$ resveratrol @/sm$, and, surprisingly, numerous studies have suggested that the composition of intestinal microbiota is modulated by @sm$ resveratrol @/sm$, and that this may account for its anti-obesity activity and metabolic benefits. @sm$ Resveratrol @/sm$ intake (200 mg/kg/day) effects were first demonstrated in an overweight HFD mouse model, where a marked improvement in gut microbial dysbiosis and reduced fat/body weigh were observed. Impressively, the counts of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and the levels of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes-which usually decrease in obese animals:significantly increased, while the concentration of Enterococcus faecalis decreased.	3
"Although the interaction between the LPXTG motif of the CWA sorting signal and the @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ SrtA active site is well known, Wang et al. designed and studied the pentapeptide LPRDA as an @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ SrtA oligopeptidic inhibitor, with a 10.61 microM of IC50 value inhibition of the recombinant enzyme. The original report contains no characterization data for LPRDA. Moreover, the authors mentioned in the experimental section that ""to improve its pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy, the @sm$ oligopeptide @/sm$ was modified by PEG2000 modification and amide modification at the N- and C-termini, respectively"". There were also inconsistencies in the molecular modeling of interactions of the pentapeptide LPRDA with the @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ SrtA active site, which prompted us to perform our own in-depth theoretical analysis."	3
Amino acids such as @sm$ alliin @/sm$ represent one of the important components of garlic. The alliinase enzyme can convert @sm$ alliin @/sm$ to allicin which is one of the main components of garlic. This chemical compound is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of this herbal medicine. Garlic was demonstrated to exhibit antibacterial activity against a varied range of different bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) such as @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas, Salmonella typhi, Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.	3
Among 5 carbohydrates, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, lactose, and sucrose produced similar patterns of taxonomic content, with very few streptococcal species other than S. salivarius, despite notable variations among replicates of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and lactose groups. Conversely, in CCS biofilms formed with GlcN and especially GlcNAc, significant expansion by the species of @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, S.	2
Among all 30 @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolates, 11 strains contained PMQR genes including qnrS1 (n = 7), aac (6')-Ib-cr4 (n = 4), qnrB4 (n = 2), qnrA1 (n = 2) and qnrD1 (n = 1). None of the isolates were positive for qnrC and qepA. The five strains carrying the aac (6')-Ib-cr4 gene were all MDR and had reduced susceptibility to @sm$ quinolones @/sm$. In addition, 5 strains of @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ with a single point mutation in qnrS1 were susceptible to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.	4
Among all of the predominant species with the average prevalence of more than 0.1% in any groups, 13 species were significantly altered in mice with 5-weeks or 15-weeks @sm$ CCl4 @/sm$ treatment when compared with NC. As shown in Figures 2E,F, four species including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides dorei, @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$, and Bacteroides vulgatus were progressively increased while two species including Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis were progressively decreased during the development of @sm$ CCl4 @/sm$-induced liver cirrhosis, and showed a significant difference between @sm$ CCl4 @/sm$-treated mice and NC after 15-weeks intervention, indicating modulation of these six species might prevent liver cirrhosis.	3
Among gram-negative bacteria, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Alloprevotella, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus are present at a higher percentage in subjects with halitosis than in healthy subjects. Gram-negative anaerobes are the most active producers of @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$; among these bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, which belong to the red complex, are associated with periodontal diseases and positively correlated with IOH. For example, it has been shown that @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$ and methyl mercaptan are abundantly produced at sites of periodontal inflammation. Moreover, Porphyromonas spp., @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp., and Treponema denticola may play a crucial role in providing amino acids to other anaerobic bacteria to produce @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$ and methyl mercaptan. Porphyromonas gingivalis, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, and Fusobacterium nucleatum are the major producers of indole and skatole (also called 3-methylindole).	1
Among methylotrophic bacteria, @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ has been widely used for the production of amino acids such as lysine, threonine, glutamate, and serine because of its higher growth rate on methanol as the sole carbon source. In @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$, genes for methanol assimilation are present on the plasmid and can be upregulated to enhance the growth rate. Brautaset et al. showed that by overexpressing pyruvate carboxylase and repressing the competing pathway for glutamate synthesis, l-lysine could be overproduced (65 g/L titer) by @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ when methanol-fed batch fermentation was used. Additionally, in the same study, repression of homoserine dehydrogenase genes caused significantly elevated glutamate production (69 g/L titer) from methanol. M. extorquens can naturally produce serine from @sm$ glycine @/sm$; thus, this methylotrophic bacterium is a suitable host for serine production.	2
Among other species identified as glycerol and 1,2-PD utilizers by the activity of glycerol/diol dehydratases and therefore potential propionate producers were @gm$ R. obeum @/gm$ and R. gnavus, F. prautii and I. butyriciproducens, and Veillonella spp. R. gnavus is known to utilize mucins and degrades fucosylated glycans to propanol and propionate most likely via the formation of 1,2-PD. F. prautii and I. butyriciproducens of Clostridium cluster IV do not utilize @sm$ fucose @/sm$. Roseburia inulivorans which utilizes @sm$ fucose @/sm$ and degrades it to propionate and propanol, was not recovered in the screening conducted.	2
Among the bioremediation techniques, bacteria play a vital role in the mobilization, transformation and bioremediation of @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ through complex metabolic processes of reduction, oxidation, methylation and volatilization. Many of the bacterial species, e.g., Bacillus sp., Bacillus flexus and @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, Pseudomonas sp., and Achromobacter sp., have been used for @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ bioremediation in many laboratory experiments as bacteria can grow as biofilm or attach to a surface in the form of colonies. A surface is a key requirement for the formation of biofilm by bacteria. However, for @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ removal, the microbes/biomass poses certain issues regarding solid-liquid separation, swelling and special work conditions.	2
Among the candidates are neurotransmitter, such as @sm$ gamma-aminobutyric acid @/sm$ (@sm$ GABA @/sm$) and serotonin or their precursors, such as tryptophan for serotonin. Change in gut synthesis of these metabolites can have impacts on brain via various routes, including directly reaching the brain, providing the precursor for brain synthesis of the neurotransmitters, and direct impact on the enteric nervous system or on the vagus nerve. Interestingly several probiotics, including Bifidobacterium, have been reported to synthesize @sm$ GABA @/sm$, which would act mostly at the enteric nervous system or via the vagus nerve. Further evidence comes from studies where intervention with probiotics led to changes in behavior or gene expression in the brain. For example, treatment with a @gm$ lactobacillus @/gm$ strain was shown to impact both central GABA receptor expression as well as emotional behavior via the vagus nerve.	1
Among the customized panels, @sm$ BDQ @/sm$ and CLO also show excellent sensitivity in most RGM species. In addition, compared with the three most prevalent SGM, @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$, M.	3
Among the intestinal bacteria that produce mitophagy inducers, we know Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$, which metabolize urolithins from @sm$ ellagitannin @/sm$ and ellagic acid.	2
Among the most abundant taxa in control cultures (Fig 1E), nine are predicted to produce butyrate from amino acid L-lysine or @sm$ L-glutamate @/sm$. Similarly, among the 19 most abundant butyrate producers in control cultures (32% of the community) all but three, namely Oscillibacter ruminantium, @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ and Pseudoflavonifractor phocaeensis, displayed reduced relative abundance in all medicinal herb-supplemented cultures (Fig 3A).	1
Among the proposed solutions to overcome ED scarcity in @sm$ MCC @/sm$ production, integration of CE with syngas fermentation has been proposed in several different configurations, thus applying H2 and CO as alternative EDs for CE. Syngas (H2/CO2/CO) and water-gas shifted syngas (H2/CO2) can be produced by gasification of lignocellulosic biomass, making even the most recalcitrant fractions of lignocellulose bioavailable to anaerobic bacteria via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Co-feeding H2 directly to the anaerobic microbiota is one of the simplest strategies to steer its electrons into acetate, ethanol, butyrate, and even caproate. Application of H2, CO2 (and occasionally CO) in fermentation systems can support @sm$ MCC @/sm$ production through: (i) production of acetate, being the most common product of syngas fermentation and an electron acceptor in CE; (ii) production of ethanol, an ED for CE; and (iii) direct production of @sm$ MCC @/sm$ by species such as Clostridium carboxidivorans or @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$. Furthermore, H2 and CO2 may have either detrimental or beneficial thermodynamic and kinetic effects on carboxylate production depending on their partial pressure. For instance, abundant CO2 supply was reported to favor @sm$ MCC @/sm$ production in mixed communities, but high partial pressure of H2 makes CE by Clostridium kluyveri less favorable.	1
Among the series of SCFAs tested, the butyrate levels were significantly higher in the bacterial culture supernatants of both @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ and Porphyromonas gingivalis, as compared to those of other CRC-enriched bacteria that failed to induce senescence-like cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 4a). Butyrate reportedly possesses both tumour promotive and suppressive properties through energetic or epigenetic functions, depending on the cell type, duration and amount of exposure. Importantly, the treatment of HDFs with the same butyrate concentrations present in the bacterial culture supernatants of Porphyromonas gingivalis (1.53 mM) indeed provoked senescence-like phenotypes, but this was not the case with other SCFAs (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Fig. 6). Although the same concentration of butyrate present in the culture supernatant of @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ (0.69 mM) alone weakly induced senescence-like cell-cycle arrest, a co-treatment with the other SCFAs present in this culture supernatant more robustly induced this phenomenon (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Fig. 6), implying that other SCFAs may also cooperate with butyrate in provoking senescence-like phenotypes, especially with low butyrate levels. Note that the treatment of normal human colonic epithelial cells with a mixture of SCFAs, at the same concentrations as in the culture supernatants of @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ and Porphyromonas gingivalis, also caused senescence-like cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. 7). This is somewhat consistent with a previous observation that the CRC-associated microbiome showed an association with the pathways responsible for the conversion of different amino acids to @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate, and propionate.	1
Among the ten metabolites having the most discriminative (i.e., the highest loading values according to VIP) for classification between the two groups, CD patients showed higher fecal levels of two amino acids (L-leucine and L-norleucine) and two organic acids (methylmalonic acid, succinic acid), and lower levels of all major SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propanol acid) and three BAs (deoxycholic acid, @sm$ hyodeoxycholic acid @/sm$, and lithocholic acid) (Figure 2c). Notably, the reduced levels of SCFAs in the CD patients could be well correlated with the lower abundances of multiple SCFA-producing taxa assigned to Firmicutes phylum, such as Faecalibacterium, Clostridium clusters IV and XIVb, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, and Ruminococcus (Figure 1b).	1
Among these, nine were only annotated in FBT_H samples, namely, Vibrio alginolyticus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Serratia liquefaciens, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$, and Pantoea agglomerans; and four were only annotated in FBT_S communities, namely, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium butyricum, Bacillus licheniformis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (Table 1). Obviously, P. putida was the most abundant inferred probiotic with 80% proportions in both sample groups, which can use caffeine as its sole source of carbon and @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$, rendering it a potential candidate for bio-decaffeination, the production of caffeine derivatives, and environmental remediation of caffeine.	2
Among this community, URE has been found in @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$, which is a known ureolytic bacterium in the rumen. The presence of ACS has been allocated to three bacteria belonging to the order Clostridiales, which is consistent with previous studies. Consistent with the upregulation of the abundances of URE and ACS, the abundances of @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$ carrying URE tended to be upregulated and the abundances of bacteria carrying ACS were also upregulated by urea supplementation. A further important finding was that most of the microbes with Ni-dependent enzyme genes have more than one Ni-dependent enzyme gene encoded in their genomes. Ni-dependent enzymes have been shown to have metabolic interactions. For example, the [NiFe]-hydrogenase catalyzes the generation of @sm$ H2 @/sm$, which is required by the acetogens in the generation of acetate.	1
Amounts of @sm$ putrescine @/sm$, cadaverine, and tyramine were measured in vaginal washings from five patients with non-specific vaginitis (NSV) associated with Gardnerella vaginalis, five patients with trichomoniasis, and five healthy controls. @sm$ Putrescine @/sm$ and cadaverine were present in all but one sample from the infected patients; tyramine was found in four of five samples from the women with NSV and in two of five samples from those with trichomoniasis. The mean cadaverine to @sm$ putrescine @/sm$ ratio was significantly higher in the patients with NSV than in those with trichomoniasis. Samples from the five controls contained only very small amounts of any of the three amines. The amine content of nine of 10 samples from the infected women was reduced to normal values after metronidazole treatment. The possible sources of the amines from Trichomonas vaginalis and @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ are discussed with reference to the clinical response to treatment.	1
Amplification of @sm$ methicillin @/sm$-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated directly with blood cultures by targeting the MecA gene encoding penicillinbinding protein-2 for conferring @sm$ methicillin @/sm$ resistance (lower detection limit or LOD of 102 copies per reaction) and Spa gene encoding protein A (LOD of 103 copies per reaction). In plasma, the direct detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated with LOD of 2.8 ng total DNA per ml plasma. In faeces, amplification of DNA from pathogens has been demonstrated with a number of targets including Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B, Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$, E.	4
An alignment of both Fusarium candidate proteins with these @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ proteins is shown in  Figure 3 . The highlighted amino acids at positions 302 and 322 are specific for ACC deaminases and d-cysteine desulfhydrases. While Acd1 and the cysteine desulfhydrase from @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ contain leucine and threonine, respectively, at these positions, Acd2 and the @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ ACC deaminase have methionine and leucine. Acd1 was therefore tested with d-cysteine as substrate. d-cysteine desulfhydrases convert d-cysteine into pyruvate, @sm$ H2S @/sm$ and NH3.	1
An analysis of 118 patients with CRC, 140 with adenomas, and 128 healthy participants revealed enrichment of Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis and depletion of Coprobacter fastidiosus, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, Roseburia intestinalis, and Roseburia inulinivorans in CRC compared with other groups. Moreover, the quantification of 97 metabolites showed an increase in 16 metabolites (L-alanine, glycine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid, phenyl lactic acid, oxoglutaric acid, L-phenylalanine, L-alpha-aminobutyric acid, phenylacetic acid, palmitoleic acid, @sm$ 3-aminoisobutanoic acid @/sm$, and norvaline), and one metabolite (butyric acid) was depleted in patients with CRC compared to healthy individuals.	0
An analysis of 118 patients with CRC, 140 with adenomas, and 128 healthy participants revealed enrichment of Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis and depletion of Coprobacter fastidiosus, Eubacterium ventriosum, @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$, and Roseburia inulinivorans in CRC compared with other groups. Moreover, the quantification of 97 metabolites showed an increase in 16 metabolites (L-alanine, glycine, @sm$ L-proline @/sm$, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid, phenyl lactic acid, oxoglutaric acid, L-phenylalanine, L-alpha-aminobutyric acid, phenylacetic acid, palmitoleic acid, 3-aminoisobutanoic acid, and norvaline), and one metabolite (butyric acid) was depleted in patients with CRC compared to healthy individuals.	0
An effective and specific method is bacterial degradation of @sm$ pyrethroid @/sm$ (a pesticide). Highly efficient bacterial strain of Enterobacter aerogenes can degrade many other pesticides, that is, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and so forth. @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ (MA-19) strain was used for degradation study of organophosphate pesticides, by enrichment culture method. Four additional compounds were added to enhance efficiency, out of which Na succinate was very effective; by increasing its concentration the rate of degradation of malathion increased. The same methodology was applied to degrade para-nitrophenol by Rhodococcus bacteria. It is an efficient bacterial decomposition method for para-nitrophenol. Similarly, organophosphate pesticides degradation is carried out by using strains Bacillus, Actinobacteria, and L-proteobacteria. Bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis is effective in degrading malathion in minimum salt media. With the addition of glucose and yeast, the growth of bacteria increases up to 105-fold which degrades more than 99% malathion within 30 days. Residues were studied by HPLC and GC-MS. Esbiothrin was degraded with much efficiency by immobilized @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ on magnetic polyurethane.	2
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for the detection of antibodies against @gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$ using serum from control rams (Con-S), naturally infected rams (Inf-S), rams inoculated intravenously with @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ (IV-S) and rams vaccinated intramuscularly (IM-S). The serum was titrated by serial double dilutions from 1/25 to 1/25,600 against whole bacteria, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ and a detergent-extracted component of the outer membrane complex of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ as antigens immobilised on microtitre plates. Sheep antibodies bound to antigen were assayed with rabbit anti-sheep gammaglobulin and alkaline phosphatase conjugated protein A. A high level of antibody activity against intact @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ cells was detected in Inf-S and IM-S. When @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ was the immobilised antigen, only IM-S yielded significant antibody activity. The component from detergent extracts of the outer membrane complex of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ reacted best with serum (up to 1/6,400) from field-infected rams, while serum from vaccinated and intravenously inoculated rams registered significant titres up to a serum dilution of 1/800 and 1/200 respectively.	1
An immunofluorescence microscopy assay was performed in order to visualize the localizations of SspA, SspB, and YzpA at the @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ cell surface. Briefly, ZY05719, DeltasspA, DeltasspB, DeltayzpA and their complemented strains were grown to exponential phase, and then washed three times with sterile @sm$ PBS @/sm$.	0
An immunofluorescence microscopy assay was performed to visualise the localisation of SssP1 and vimentin during the interaction between @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ and HBMECs. First, the HBMECs were seeded onto 24-well cell plates and treated with SssP1NR216-781 or SssP1NR1711-2214 (100 mug/well) for 1 h at 37 C. Then, cells were fixed with cold @sm$ methanol @/sm$ at -20 C for 20 min and incubated with the appropriate antibody (1:1000 dilution) at 37 C for 1 hour.	0
An improved preservation of @sm$ ascorbic acid @/sm$, glutathione, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity was observed following lactic acid fermentation of smoothies and tomato juice with Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus or Weissella cibaria. Lactic acid fermentation started with L. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, P. pentosaceus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Bifidobacterium breve and @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ increases @sm$ Vitamin C @/sm$ concentration, phenolic content and antioxidant activity of carrots, French beans, marrows, black beans, pomegranate juice, soy milk and cowpeas.	1
An in vitro study showed mycolactone genes downregulated in response to various sugar sources, and other research showed that nutrient availability (chitin versus @sm$ calcium @/sm$) regulates several metabolic pathways in @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$; however, mycolactone toxin was not expressed in these nutrient-abundant environments, suggesting that its expression may be regulated mainly under stressful conditions.	3
An increased number of Bacteroidetes species can suppress the inflammatory response through zwitterionic capsular @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, which are bacterial products that modulate T cells to secrete the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10. It has also been reported that alginate can be fermented by specific bacteria in feces, such as Bacteroides ovatus, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, and Bacteroides theaiotaomicron, which can induce colonic regulatory T cells and promote anti-inflammatory effects.	1
An observation of the @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ MG GAPDH sequence against the Protein Data Bank revealed L. acidophilus GAPDH (PDB:5J9G) as the closest structural homologue, with 92.90% identity. @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ MG GAPDH lacks a signal peptide sequence, transmembrane domain, and membrane-anchoring domain. The structural difference between the @sm$ MG @/sm$-binding site rich in the exposed region and the JAM-2-binding sites rich in the buried regions with helical structures was confirmed in the secondary structure model, predicted using the NetSurfP server (Figure 7).	0
An unexpectedly high frequency of mercury-resistant strains showing also an increased tolerance to gentamicin, streptomycin and @sm$ D-cycloserine @/sm$ has been reported among the clinical non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolates of species M. avium, M. intracellulare and @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$.	4
Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol, sevoflurane or @sm$ desflurane @/sm$ and fentanyl or remifentanil was used for analgesia, while cisatracurium, rocuronium or suxamethonium facilitated tracheal intubation. The airway was kept patent with a tracheal tube (high volume/low pressure; Unomedical, Copenhagen, Denmark; n = 119) or a laryngeal mask (AuraOnce; Ambu A/@gm$ S, Ballerup @/gm$, Denmark; n = 82) for mamma (n = 49), gastrointestinal (n = 33), gynaecological (n = 11), orthopaedic (n = 5), plastic (n = 11), urological (n = 71), hepatic (n = 6), or vascular surgery (n = 15).	0
Analogously to LOD values, the toxicity of @sm$ Cd @/sm$, Hg and Zn to the nine sensor strains was different. These differences were the most remarkable for @sm$ Cd @/sm$ (about four orders of magnitude) and less for Hg and Zn (about 100-fold, Figure 1). In general, all the tested heavy metals were the most toxic to Gram-positive species, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. E. coli tolerated about 30 and 20-fold and the least sensitive @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ tolerated about 2,500 and 40-fold higher concentrations of @sm$ Cd @/sm$ and Zn than the Gram-positive strains, respectively (Figure 1). Thus, differently from LOD values, which were mostly dependent on the genetic metal-response element used in the sensor bacteria, the toxicity of @sm$ Cd @/sm$, Zn and Hg was dependent on the (bacterial) host.	3
Analysing treatment groups separately, preserved beta cell function (high C peptide) in the autologous group was characterised at baseline by high @gm$ C. catus @/gm$, high induction of the colanic acid biosynthesis, @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ and beta oxidation pathways and high CCL22 and CXCL12 expression, as well as a subsequent decrease in R. bromii, which correlates negatively with these two pathways and CCL22 at baseline (figure 6B). In the allogenic group, preserved beta cell function was characterised by a decrease in faecal Roseburia intestinalis and a decrease in the UMP biosynthesis pathway (which incidentally correlates positively with Prevotella 1 and 2) and a decrease in CD86 and CCL18 expression, which were both higher in responders at baseline and subsequently decreased. Both CD86 and CCL18 genes in turn correlate with R. intestinalis, while CCL18 in addition correlates positively with the UMP biosynthesis pathway (figure 6C). Finally, in clinical responders, preserved beta cell function was characterised by decreases in duodenal Prevotella 1, Prevotella 2, faecal @gm$ C. catus @/gm$, metabolite EPL-GPE, the pathway @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ and beta oxidation and CD4+ CXCR3+ T cell s, whereas D.	2
Analysis of the @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ SKV38 genome revealed the presence of seven other potential full-length autotransporters but no other types of classical diderm adhesins. None of them appeared to be involved in cell-to-cell interactions or biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces, and their function remains to be fully elucidated. As @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ is present in different microbiota, it is expected that a large arsenal of adhesion factors is necessary to adhere under different mechanical constraints and on different surfaces, such as tooth enamel or various epithelia. Moreover, Veillonella is known to coaggregate with streptococci, which produce the favored Veillonella @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source, lactate, and it was shown to specifically coaggregate with Streptococcus and Actinomyces strains from the same microbiota, showing that coaggregation could have strong implications for niche colonization of these bacteria. @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and other Veillonella spp.	2

Analysis of the strain @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ strain ICIS-310 genome revealed genes involved in resistance to antibiotics, such as ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, @sm$ lomefloxacin @/sm$, azithromycin, and ampicillin. The ANAEROtest 24 biochemical method (Lachema, Czech Republic) revealed that the @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ strain ferments glucose, fructose, galactose, melezitose, esculin, mannose, cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, salicin, trehalose, mannitol, rhamnose, arabinose, and sorbitol.	4
Analytical grade chemicals were used in all experiments including synthesis of @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ nanoparticles and media preparation for growth of bacterial cells. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2 6H2O, 98% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used as a precursor to synthesize @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ NPs. Glycerol and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from R&M Marketing (UK). The bacterial cultures of Gram-negative bacteria @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis UPMC1175 and antibiotics (Streptomycin) was obtained from the Institute of Bioscience Universiti Putra Malaysia.	3
Anionic sites on the surface of @gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$ were visualized in the electron microscope by staining with positively charged ferric oxide hydrosols in acetic acid (AI-reagent), or propanoic acid (PI-reagent), and with a polycationic ferritin derivative. With the AI-reagent, single or small aggregates of ferric oxide particles were bound to the cell surface of Br. canis, whereas, with the lipophilic PI-reagent, the microorganisms were heavily stained with focal aggregates of iron granules. The polycationic ferritin label was uniformly distributed over the entire cell surface of Br. canis. The ferritin label was not bound on the surface of the organisms after prior treatment with trichloroacetic acid or methanolic hydrochloric acid. Treatment with aqueous acetone, chloroform/methanol, @sm$ diethyl ether @/sm$, sodium deoxycholate, pronase, lysozyme, hyaluronidase, and sodium periodate neither influenced the morphology  of the @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ nor diminished their ionic binding sites.	3
Another control-enriched bacterial marker, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, was previously identified to be negatively associated with fundamental components of eukaryotic cell membranes. Similarly, differential pathways partly overlapped with HDC related pathways, including those involved in @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$, protein and glycogen metabolism, the decreased abundances of which were known to associated with nutrient deficiency and dysfunction of intestine (Additional file 8: Table S8 and Additional file 9: Table S9).	0
Another example is found in human milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ (HMOs), which are thought to function as prebiotics, selectively cultivating a desirable gut microbiota. HMOs present an analogous pool of hundreds of complex sugars which are similar in structure to mucin glycans and have fascinating bioactive properties. Because human infants lack the enzymatic capability to process HMOs, undigested @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ become the primary carbon source in the intestines. As a result, bacterial strains involved in initial colonization of the gut must utilize HMOs. Accordingly, breastfed infants have higher proportions of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, which are known to metabolize HMOs, than infants fed formula, which contains a lower abundance and diversity of @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$.	2
Another research found the secretion of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$-derived antibiotics (turbomycin A and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline) by BA 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria, C. scindens and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$, both antibiotics function by inhibiting the growth of C.	1
Another scenario was noticed for the co-cultivation of @gm$ B. stellenboschense @/gm$ and B. biavatii grown in the presence of @sm$ glycogen @/sm$, where only the latter strain seems to take advantage of the presence of the other strain (Fig. 3). In fact, under these circumstances B. biavatii substantially enhanced transcription of various genes encoding enzymes predicted to be involved in the hydrolysis of @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ such as predicted glycosyl hydrolases of the GH13 and GH77 families, as well as a glycogen phosphorylase (Fig. 3). In contrast, @gm$ B. stellenboschense @/gm$ did not reveal any transcriptional modulation of genes with predicted functions in @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ utilization when the strains were co-cultivated (Fig.	2
Another study on pectins with different degrees of methoxylation and viscosity emphasized the importance of both these parameters as well as molecular weight on @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$-lowering properties in humans. A high viscosity fibre blend reduced LDL cholesterol more than a low viscosity wheat bran. However, the impact of different fibre preparations on SCFA profiles has not been thoroughly investigated. As SCFA play a key role in effects on adiposity and metabolism, the SCFA pattern formed after ingestion of different fibre preparations warrants further investigation. Moreover, how viscosity and methoxylation of fibres affect the gut microbiota composition has, to our knowledge, not been examined. In the present study, we compared two pure preparations of dietary fibres, guar gum (a galactomannan) and pectin (a rhamnogalactouronan) with different physico-chemical properties, on weight gain, SCFA profiles, @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ and glucose levels and liver steatosis in high-fat fed rats. Moreover, we quantified the levels of three bacterial genera known previously to be affected by fibres: Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and Bacteroides, as well as the levels of the species Akkermansia muciniphila, in caecal samples.	3
Another study suggested that suppression of unsaturated fatty acids was due to a direct inhibitory effect on methanogenic Archaea such as Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, and @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$. Lipid supplementation with any kind of plant or animal based oil is a costly method to implement at a large scale and may result in specific drawbacks such as poor fiber digestibility, depressed milk fat synthesis, and altered @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ composition of the product.	3
Another such an example is cyclophosphamide, an anti-cancer immune-suppressant chemo-therapeutic, which efficacy is dependent on Barnesiella intestinihominis and @gm$ Enterococcus hirae @/gm$ (gut commensals) that contribute to the translocation of lymphoid organ and mimic the production of pathogenic T helper 17 cells and memory Th1 immune responses. During cyclophosphamide therapy, Barnesiella intestinihominis accumulates in the colon and infiltrates gammadeltaT cells in the cancer lesion. Whereas @gm$ Enterococcus hirae @/gm$ translocates to secondary lymphoid organs and stimulates intratumoral CD8/Treg ratio. Microbial influences on the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, and @sm$ 5-fluorouracil @/sm$ have also been reported.	0
"Another such region is a 1122bp long locus that includes parts of the glpFKX operon that enables aerobic @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ fermentation. Loss of capacity to ferment @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ is shared by several @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ ""branch 1"" strains, including CO92, due to a deletion in the glpD gene. Furthermore, additional deletions in the glpFKX operon are often present. The aerobic @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ fermentation pathway has been suggested to upregulate @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ biofilm formation in the flea gut. In addition, a negative selection against glpK activity in the presence of dysfunctional glpD has been suggested. The fact that the glpFKX operon is pseudogenized in some @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ strains but not all indicates that its loss is not adaptive to the shift from an environmental and enteric life-style to one of specialized rodent-flea transmission, but is rather due to either genetic drift or a selective advantage specific to the glpFKX pseoudogenized strains. The aerobic @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ fermentation pathway is induced during different phases of the @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ infectious cycle."	2
Antibacterial activity of petroleum ether (PE), benzene (BE), chloroform (CE), @sm$ acetone @/sm$ (@sm$ AE @/sm$) and ethanol (EE) extracts of dried Elaeocarpus sphaericus fruit was investigated against 28 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using the disc diffusion and plate dilution methods. The @sm$ AE @/sm$ fraction showed marked antimicrobial activity against ten organisms. BE was active against Salmonella typhimurium and Morganella morganii, and EE against @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$, Shigella flexnerii and Sh.	3
Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using disc diffusion plate method according to the instructions of the CA-SFM / EUCAST 2020 (https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints_and_dosing/eucast_setting_breakpoints/), in reference to the EUCAST disk diffusion method for susceptibility testing of the @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ group isolates. Antibiotic discs used were the following: erythromycin (15 mug/ml), penicillin G (10 UI), doxycycline (30 mug/ml), rifampicin (30 mug/ml), vancomycin (30 mug/ml), clindamycin (15 mug/ml), @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$ (50 mug/ml), amoxicillin (25 mug/ml), colistin (15 mug/ml), gentamycin (500 mug/ml), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (30 mug/ml), ceftriaxone (30 mug/ml), colistin (50 mug/ml), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (25 mug/ml), oxacillin (5 mug/ml), imipenem (10 mug/ml), tobramycin (10 mug/ml), and metronidazole (4 mug/ml).	3
Antibiotics tested were @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ (benzylpenicillin), ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, cefoxitin, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, clindamycin, tigecycline, and doxycycline. Due to a lack of availability, eravacycline could not be tested. The ranges of dilution were as follows: @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ and clindamycin 0.03 mg/L to 2 mg/L; ampicillin/sulbactam 0.5 mg/L to 16 mg/L; piperacillin/tazobactam 0.5 mg/L to 16 mg/L (0.125 mg/L to 4 mg/L for @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. and F. necrophorum); metronidazole 0.5 mg/L to 16 mg/L (0.125 mg/L to 8 mg/L for @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. and F. necrophorum); moxifloxacin 0.06 mg/L to 2 mg/L; tigecycline and doxycycline 0.125 mg/L to 4 mg/L; imipenem and meropenem 0.25 mg/L to 8 mg/L (0.03 mg/L to 1 mg/L for @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp.	3
Antimicrobial susceptibility of 181 (107 ail-harboring isolates and 74 non-ail-harboring) @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ isolates obtained from the oral cavity of swine was determined against 24 antimicrobial agents. All Y. enterocolitica isolates were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, enrofloxacin, aminoglycosides, and @sm$ nitrofurantoin @/sm$.	3
Antimicrobial susceptibility of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. was assessed with the broth microdilution method using 17 antimicrobial agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem, aztreonam, gentamicin, @sm$ amikacin @/sm$, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and colistin) in accordance with the 2016 Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.	3
Aptamer-based fluorescent biosensor assays were performed using a 96 well microplate with covalently-linked N-oxysuccinimide (NOS) esters that quickly react with primary @sm$ amine @/sm$ groups (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). In order to varify the aptamer's ability to distinguish @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ from other food-poisoning bacteria (other @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species, E. coli, S. typimurium), capture probes and detection probes were chemically synthesized as 5'-@sm$ amine @/sm$-modified SS-4 and Cy5-labelled SS-3 at the 5'-end respectively. The assay was prepared as follows: (1) the 5' @sm$ amine @/sm$ modified aptamer (SS-4) was coated with a concentration of 1 muM (100 pmol in 100 muL treatment volume) per single well NOS (N-oxysuccinimide) surface in a 96-microwell plate for 1 h at RT.	0
Arguably, @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ exhibits two faces as both pathogen and commensal, which is attributable to the metabolic diversity of RTs. Specifically, RT5 is strongly associated with acne, while RT6 is enriched in healthy skin, and RT1 is abundant in both acne and normal individuals. In this regard, in order to investigate the metabolic variations among ribotypes, we additionally reconstructed GEMs of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC6919 @/gm$ (RT1) and HL110PA3 (RT6) based on protein similarity search and iCA843 (see Material and Methods). Surprisingly, the ribotype-specific GEMs shared similar central metabolic pathways including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways and TCA cycle, with minor variations in @sm$ cellobiose @/sm$ utilization and phenylalanine biosynthesis (see  Supplementary Table 6 ). These metabolic similarities motivated us to further explore the potential genetic variations among ribotypes that may underlie the two faces of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ strains.	2
As Tables 1 and 2 show, each of the 29 @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-resistant bifidobacterial strains possessed one @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance determinant [tet(W), or tet(O), or tet(S) gene], and none of the 13 @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance determinants tested were detected in the 71 @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-sensitive bifidobacterial strains. The occurrence of the tet(W), tet(O), and tet(S) genes among the 100 bifidobacterial strains of the seven @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species tested are further summarized in Table 3.	4
As an anaerobic microbe, the genus Prevotella only possesses a limited repertoire of enzymes for @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism and energy production. The enzyme content varies from species to species. Prevotella intermedia ZT and Prevotella intermedia 17 have relatively incomplete pathways but the enzyme repertoire in @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$ is the most reduced. Compared with the oral-isolated taxa, the rumen isolated Prevotella ruminicola has the most comprehensive repertoire of @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ usage enzyme (Table 9).	2
As an example, in our cohort and in previous studies, a higher abundance of mecA was found in neonates born by CS, which is likely attributable to colonisation by @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ and Staphylococcus from the skin microbiome. Previous studies have reported a higher overall abundance of ARGs and a higher abundance of multidrug resistance-conferring genes bcr, mls_abc, mls_hdr, macAB, ykk, and mdr; the tetracycline resistance-conferring gene tet_efflux; the @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ resistance-conferring gene blt; and the vancomycin resistance-conferring gene vanA in the stool of neonates born by CS.	4
As examples, @sm$ propionic acid @/sm$ and, mainly, lactic acid at high concentrations exhibited antimicrobial activity against some species of ruminal bacteria. In the presence of organic acids such as acetic, lactic, and succinic acids Pediococcus acidilactici K10 demonstrated great in-vitro growth inhibiting ability against the pathogenic strain @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$.	3
As examples, the primary lesions of yaws may be mistaken for cutaneous leishmaniasis, tropical ulcer caused by fusobacteria and @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$, or pyoderma. Of particular importance is the emergence of H. ducreyi, the causative organism of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, as a common cause of non-genital skin lesions in a number of countries where yaws is endemic. There are now reports of H. ducreyi as a cause of non-genital skin lesions from Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Ghana and Vanuatu. Data from experimental models of chancroid suggest that these lesions should be responsive to @sm$ azithromycin @/sm$, and therefore, that mass distribution of @sm$ azithromycin @/sm$ for yaws (and possibly trachoma) could also be effective in treating lesions resulting from infection with H.	3
As expected, we found a significant increase in @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ in the urine of autistic children, compared with their US (Figure 7). @sm$ Para-cresol @/sm$ (@sm$ 4-methylphenol @/sm$) is an organic aromatic compound mainly derived from the microbially mediated decarboxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate, an intermediate of the tyrosine catabolism. Notably, high levels of p-hydroxyphenylacetate are directly related to gut bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis with the prevalence of Clostridium difficile. However, at least 55 bacteria strains have been identified as @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ producing bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, and Romboutsia lituseburensis belonging to the Clostridia class (Firmicutes phylum), and Olsenella uli belonging to the Coriobacteria class (Actinobacteria phylum). In addition, Pseudomonas stutzeri produces @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ from toluene by expressing the enzyme toluene monooxygenase. Our results are in line with data from the literature; in fact, in individuals with ASD, gut dysbiosis, in conjunction with the gut mucosa inflammation and the slow intestinal transit, promotes an increase in @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ in urine and blood. Less than 1% of total @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ is present in free form; approximately 95% of @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ is metabolized to p-cresol sulfate, prevalently in the colon and liver, and the remaining 3-4% is metabolized to p-cresol glucuronide in the liver only. Beyond the well-known toxicity of @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ and that of its end-products p-cresol sulfate and p-cresol glucuronide, a recent study on animal models found that @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ selectively induces ASD core behavioral symptoms. In individuals with ASD, @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ abundance positively correlates with the severity of the disease; a possible mechanism of @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$ toxicity is the inhibition of the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, leading to an imbalance of neurotransmitters and playing a primary role in the accumulation of dopamine.	1
As facultative intracellular pathogens, @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ can invade and survive in macrophages, and macrophages can secrete a variety of cytokines to regulate host immune responses to defend against its infection, although @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ has evolved a variety of defense mechanisms. In this study, macrophages were incubated with the prokaryotic expressed Pal protein of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, and Pal up-regulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, but did not IL-1beta and IL-6. Similar with our results, it was reported that, in Brucella suis infected macrophages, Pal protein by @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-induced expression could inhibit the expression of IL-1beta and IL-6. However, inconsistent with our findings, Pal proteins of E. coli, L. pneumoniae and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, up-regulated the secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These studies indicated that there were some differences roles in stimulating macrophage to secrete cytokines between @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ Pal protein and other Pal proteins.	4
As for metabolites, Bifidobacterium genus were positively correlated with propionate, butyrate, valerate, aspartate, glutamate, @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$, beta-glucose and tryptophan. Dramatically, although Proteobacteria phylum were positively correlated with valerate, @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ and beta-glucose, Sutterella genus were negatively correlated with propionate, butyrate, valerate, aspartate, @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ and beta-glucose. In addition, Muribaculum genus were positively correlated with glycine, @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ and valerate. Lactobacillus genus were negatively correlated with beta-glucose and @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$. @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ genus were positively correlated with choline.	0
As for the activity toward amino donors the profile of activity toward amino acids for GEO1900 (Table S1) was similar to that reported for related BCATs from E.coli, Bacillus brevis and @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ (Norton and Sokatch,; Lee-Peng et al.,; Inoue et al.,; Kanda et al.,; Yu et al.,). GEO1900 was highly active toward branched-chain amino acids and their isomers. The AF0933 catalyzed the transamination between @sm$ L-valine @/sm$ and AKG with a specific activity of 5.76 U/mg and between L-alanine and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid with a lower specific activity of 0.16 U/mg.	2
As observed in the SCFA production, @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$ does not show an increase in R4 and R5; however, the bacterial taxa in those reactors show an increase of the following butyrate-producing genera (Table 6) (Figure 11 in complementary materials): @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$,Anaerofustis,Anaerotruncus,Blautia,Cloacibacillus,Eubacterium,Odoribacter,Parabacteroides,Roseburia, and Ruminococcus.	1
As part of the basic characterization of @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 antimicrobial drugs were determined for reference strains and Mexican isolates by a broth microdilution method. For optimal growth of the organisms, a supplemented brain-heart infusion broth was used. The susceptibility of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ to amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and @sm$ oxytetracycline @/sm$ was variable.	3

For optimal growth of the organisms, a supplemented brain-heart infusion broth was used. The susceptibility of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ to amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline was variable. However, consistent higher minimal inhibitory concentrations values were obtained for gentamicin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, @sm$ sulfamerazine @/sm$, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfachloropyridazine.	4
As reported by Duncan et al., duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ energy sources and a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridizationprobes targeting 16S rRNA sequences were used. It was reported that the fermentors supported growth of a lower proportion of Gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-R. bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides and @gm$ E. cylindroides @/gm$ and a greater proportion of Bacteroides as compared with the starting fecal inoculum. Inulin from dahlia resulted in a significant increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and @gm$ E. cylindroides @/gm$. Roseburia-related strain A2-183 F was able to grow on all substrates, despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding.	2
As shown in Figure 5C, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Leuconostoc showed the strongest positive correlation with acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester, benzoic acid, ethyl ester, nonanal and decanal. Lactococcus was positively correlated with benzene acetaldehyde, acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester, benzoic acid and ethyl ester. 3-methyl-1-butanol, @sm$ 1-dodecanol @/sm$ and (E)-2-octenal showed a positive correlation with Bacillus, Streptococcus and Escherichia_Shigella.	0
As such, primary human monocytes (CD14+) obtained from healthy human donors were differentiated into MoDC and stimulated with 104 particles of heat-killed (HK) Bifidobacterium breve (Bb15700), Akkermansia muciniphila (AmBAA-835), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn23726), @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (@gm$ Bf @/gm$25285), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Fp27766), Enterococcus hirae (Eh8043), @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (@gm$ Bf @/gm$43858), or Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn25586), or 1 ug/mL HMW @sm$ Poly I:C @/sm$ overnight (16-18 h) at 37 C, 5% CO2, without agitation.	3
As the values for the dDDH (<70%) and ANI (<96%) were below the corresponding thresholds, @gm$ strain PS @/gm$-H5 might be a new species of Cellulomonas. The PS-H5 genome encoded 173 CAZymes, including 104 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 56 glycoside transferases, 8 carbohydrate esterases, and 5 auxiliary activity enzymes. @gm$ Strain PS @/gm$-H5 harbors 14 GHs belonging to GH families 1, 13, and 127 (i.e., beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, endoglucanase, and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase) that are important for @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ and hemicellulose degradation.	2
"As there were no interpretation guidelines available for six of the investigated bacterial isolates, including the Enterobacter spp., the Aeromonas spp., and @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species other than P. aeruginosa isolates, we did not assign these as ESBL-producers in S2 Table. However, for one out of these isolates (Aeromonas hydrophila), ESBL-activity according to the rule ""more than a three twofold concentration decrease comparing growth in the presence of CTX and CTX in combination with @sm$ clavulanic acid @/sm$"" was observed (S2 Table)."	3
As to valine, @sm$ leucine @/sm$ and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica have lost all the genes except the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase which also locates in valine, @sm$ leucine @/sm$ and isoleucine degradation pathway. On the contrary, Prevotella ruminicola and @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$ have a full biosynthesis pathway.	1
At 2 h post-challenge, we observed numerous clusters of luminal @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ captured in WGA-positive mucus. These mucus embedded bacteria had low T3SA activity, suggesting that their capacity to reach this site did not require the action of T3SS effectors. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that components of the T3SA acting as pathogen-associated molecular patterns being involved in this phenomenon. In addition, luminal WGA-positive mucus was not observed in non-infected animals. Since it is well accepted that specific fixation conditions must be used to preserve mucus (Sperandio et al.), our formalin-based fixation method had most likely destroyed it in non-infected samples. Hence, the preservation of the mucus observed in luminal @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ clusters suggests that it may have unique chemical properties, as previously suggested about mucus release observed during infection of rabbit ileal loops (Sperandio et al.). Since crypt goblet cells in the vicinity of bacterial clusters had lower WGA-labeling, we reasoned that they had released the WGA-positive mucus. Goblet cells can react to microbial or pharmacological challenge by eliciting compound exocytosis (Johansson, Sjovall and Hansson). The neurotransmitter @sm$ acetylcholine @/sm$ stimulates crypt goblet cells to release their mucus (Specian). Alternatively, TLR2/4/5 ligands were shown to induce mucus release by sentinel goblet cells that are located in the upper portion of the crypt (Birchenough et al.). The massive coordinated release of mucus by goblet cells of crypts is therefore akin to that observed during @sm$ acetylcholine @/sm$ treatment, as it is not limited to the upper part of the crypt.	3
At the species level, the abundances of Escherichia coli and others including Clostridium citroniae were higher, whereas those of @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$, Roseburia faecis, and Ruminococcus bromii were lower. Eight metabolites showed significantly different plasma concentrations in the SAA and healthy control groups. Coumaric acid, L-phenylalanine, and @sm$ sulfate @/sm$ were present at higher concentrations in the SAA group; whereas L-glutamic gamma-semialdehyde, theobromine, 3a, 7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestane, gamma-delta-dioxovaleric acid, and (12Z)-9, 10-dihydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid were present at lower concentrations.	0
Avermectins were tested successfully against @gm$ Mycobacterium @/gm$ and MRSA. Likewise, an antifungal property was reported for mebendazole. Trials with a few NSAIDs (Celecoxib, aspirin, ibuprofen, and tacrolimus) against a few bacterial and fungal pathogens turned out hopeful. A number of studies were conducted using anticancer drugs to repurpose as antibacterial, 5-fluorouracil and gallium nitrate were found to be effective against MDR A. baumanni and Pseudomonas. @sm$ Tamoxifen @/sm$, floxuridine, and streptozotocin exhibited appreciable antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus isolates.	3
BACKGROUND: @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ is a seafood-borne bacterium involved in incidences of human infections following consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. Regular monitoring of seafood for @gm$ V.mimicus @/gm$ is necessary for risk assessment and to establish mitigation measures. METHOD: During the period 2017-2020, a total of 250 samples comprising finfish, shellfish, @sm$ water @/sm$, ice, and sediment samples were collected from fish markets, fish landing centers, and fish farms in the Ernakulum district on the Southwest coast of Kerala, India. @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ was isolated using enrichment in alkaline peptone @sm$ water @/sm$ for 18 h followed by plating on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar and then incubated at 37 C for 18-24 h. The presumptive @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ isolates were confirmed by biochemical characterization and molecularly with vmh gene-specific for @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$. RESULTS: The study revealed that the prevalence of @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ is 5.6% in the total of samples screened. The highest occurrence was observed in brackish @sm$ water @/sm$ fish (19%) followed by freshwater fish (18%) and marine fish (2%) samples. The study points out the risk of brackish @sm$ water @/sm$ fishes as potential carriers of this pathogen. This requires preventive measures to mitigate health hazards associated with @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ entering into the seafood production chain.	3
BACKGROUND: Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity can contribute to inhibit @sm$ thyroxine @/sm$ synthesis. Gut microbiota can interact with metabolic or immune diseases. However, dynamics of gut microbiota from the second (T2) to the third trimester (T3) in women with TPOAb-positive/negative subclinical hypothyroidism (TPOAb+/TPOAb- SCH) have not been reported. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether gut microbiota can be potential therapeutic targets for managing TPOAb+ SCH. METHODS: In this single-center prospective cohort study, we observed gut microbiota dynamics by sequencing 16S rRNA from fecal samples collected in T2 (20-23+ 6 weeks) and T3 (28-33+ 6 weeks). TPOAb+/TPOAb- SCH were stratified depending on whether or not they used @sm$ levothyroxine @/sm$ (@sm$ LT4 @/sm$) during the pregnancy (@sm$ LT4 @/sm$+/@sm$ LT4 @/sm$-). Microbiome bioinformatics analyses were performed using QIIME2. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used for the quantitative analysis of biomarkers. Functional profiling was performed with PICRUSt2. RESULTS: Distinct gut microbiota dynamics from T2 to T3 were noted in the TPOAb- (n = 68) and TPOAb+ (n = 64) SCH groups. The TPOAb+ @sm$ LT4 @/sm$- group was characterized by enriched bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Prevotella in T2 and Bacteria, Lachnospirales, Lachnospiraceae, Blautia, and Agathobacter in T3 and by depleted ASVs of Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, and Enterobacteriaceae in T2 and Actinobacteriota, Coriobacteriia, Actinobacteria, Coriobacteriales, Bifidobacteriales, Bifidobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, and Bifidobacterium longum in T3. The TPOAb+ @sm$ LT4 @/sm$+ group was characterized by enriched bacterial ASVs of Blautia, Streptococcus salivarius, and Bifidobacterium longum in T3 and by depleted ASVs of Bacteroidota, Bacteroidia, Bacteroidales, and Prevotella in T2 and Agathobacter in T3.	3
BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the effect of dietary @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ on the complex human gut microbiota, and they focused mainly on single @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ molecules and select bacterial populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effect of a moderate intake of red wine @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ on select gut microbial groups implicated in host health benefits. DESIGN: Ten healthy male volunteers underwent a randomized, crossover, controlled intervention study. After a washout period, all of the subjects received red wine, the equivalent amount of de-alcoholized red wine, or gin for 20 d each. Total fecal DNA was submitted to polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time quantitative PCR to monitor and quantify changes in fecal microbiota. Several biochemical markers were measured. RESULTS: The dominant bacterial composition did not remain constant over the different intake periods. Compared with baseline, the daily consumption of red wine @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ for 4 wk significantly increased the number of Enterococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides uniformis, Eggerthella lenta, and @gm$ Blautia coccoides @/gm$-Eubacterium rectale groups (P < 0.05). In parallel, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein concentrations decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, changes in cholesterol and C-reactive protein concentrations were linked to changes in the bifidobacteria number. CONCLUSION: This study showed that red wine consumption can significantly modulate the growth of select gut microbiota in humans, which suggests possible prebiotic benefits associated with the inclusion of red wine @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ in the diet.	1
BAL5788 is the @sm$ water @/sm$-soluble prodrug of BAL9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with potent bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$. Safety and pharmacokinetic data from a multiple-dose study with 16 healthy male volunteers are reported. Subjects were randomized to receive BAL5788 at 500 or 750 mg (as BAL9141 equivalents; n = 6 subjects per dose) or placebo (n = 2 subjects per dose). The doses were given as 200-ml infusions over 30 min once daily on days 1 and 8 and twice daily on days 2 to 7. BAL5788 was well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events (AEs) or dosing-related changes in laboratory parameters, electrocardiographic findings, or vital signs. Drug accumulation in plasma was negligible during the dosing period. The results of pharmacokinetic analyses agreed well with data reported from a previous single-ascending-dose study. The elimination half-life of BAL9141 was about 3 h. The volume of distribution at steady state was equal to the volume of the adult extracellular @sm$ water @/sm$ compartment.	0
BALB/cMlac mice were induced to neutropenia by intraperitoneal injection of 200-mg/kg @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$. On day 1 post-induction, leukocyte count was performed to confirm the successful neutropenic stage. To induce scedosporiosis, neutropenic mice were intravenously injected with 106 conidia of TMMI-012, @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ CBS 120157, L.	3
BBR depleted the species that mainly produce single sugar or SCFAs from fermenting polysaccharides or oligosaccharides, including Roseburia spp., @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp., which were frequently reported to cross-feed with the other saccharides degraders. The species enriched by BBR included two Bacteroides spp. and multiple taxa of gamma-Proteobacteria, which were also induced by @sm$ metformin @/sm$ treatment.	3
BM cells were also isolated and infected ex vivo in the presence of anti-@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ antibodies, following previous protocols. Briefly, BM cells were isolated from the tibia and femur of B. abortus-RFP-infected mice at 8 and 30 days of postinfection by flushing bones with HBSS (no calcium, no magnesium) or RPMI medium. BM cells were then incubated with B. abortus-RFP at MOI of 50 bacteria/cell at 37 C for 2 hours, washed with @sm$ PBS @/sm$, suspended in HBSS, and subjected to examination.	0
BU enabled the growth of butyrate producers in media with @sm$ inulin @/sm$, laminarin, pectic galactan, pectin and pullulan, suggesting that the corresponding PULs (PUL17, 21 and 18) degrade glycans via unselfish mechanisms. Release of PBPs by BT has been shown enhance growth and butyrate production of @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ and AC.	2
BU was initially diagnosed by clinical observations of ulceration and confirmed by microscopic findings of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) after Ziehl-Neelsen staining (resistance to acid and/or ethanol decolorization, BAAR: bacillus acido@sm$ -alcohol @/sm$-resistant), a characteristic of bacteria belonging to the Genus Mycobacterium. The use of specific serological tests was not suitable due to cross-reactivity between mycobacterial antigens. In addition, @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ can be difficult to culture, especially from environmental samples, due to the long generation time of the pathogen (>48 h) and proliferation of other mycobacteria.	3
Bacillary dysentery, common in developing countries, is usually caused by  @gm$ Shigella @/gm$  species. A major problem in shigellosis is the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. This is the first detailed molecular study on drug resistance of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolates from the Faisalabad region of Pakistan. Ninety-five @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolates obtained after screening of 2500 stool samples were evaluated for in vitro resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents; the presence or absence of 20 of the most relevant drug resistance genes; and the prevalence of integrons 1, 2, and 3.  @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$  was found to be the most prevalent and most resistant species. Collectively, high resistance was found towards ampicillin (96.84%), tetracycline (93.68%), streptomycin (77.89%), and @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ (72.63%).	4
Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis displayed a restricted tropism for oligosaccharides compared to the environmental, opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia pseudomallei and @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$. The compound with the greatest anti-adhesion activity was p-nitrophenol. Other generic attachment inhibitors included the polymeric saccharides (@sm$ dextran @/sm$ and heparin), GalNAcbeta1-4Gal, GalNAcbeta1-3Gal, Galbeta1-4GlcNAc and Galbeta1-3GlcNAc.	3
Bacteria were cultured in either minimal medium (MM) (for Bacteroides) or semidefined medium (SDM) (for bifidobacteria and lactobacilli) supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) of either AcGGM (MM-AcGGM or SDM-AcGGM) or AcAGX (MM-AcAGX or SDM-AcAGX) separately, as the sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source, and growth was evaluated as maximum optimal density at 600 nm (OD600). Commercial polymeric beta-mannans (carob glucomannan [CGM] and konjac galactomannan [KGM]) and xylans (wheat arabinoxylan [WAX]) were used as controls. All the bacteria displayed growth on MM or SDM supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, B. ovatus, B. plebeius, B. uniformis, B. dorei, and B. xylanisolvens all grew in the presence of AcGGM, whereas they displayed various levels of the ability to metabolize either CGM or KGM (Fig. 3a). B. fragilis, B. clarus, B. intestinalis, B. oleiciplenus, and B. eggerthii achieved considerable growth on AcGGM but failed to grow in the presence of both CGM and KGM (Fig. 3a). These data suggest that these strains might be able to utilize the low-molecular-weight beta-MOS present in the AcGGM mixture but cannot metabolize the high-molecular-weight beta-mannans CGM and KGM. AcAGX supported the growth of @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$, B.	2
Bacterial strains of @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ 2P08AA and A. radioresistens 50v1 were obtained through the Planetary Protection Culture Collection at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Stocks of @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ (ENG Scientific) and Kleenol 30 (Mission Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA; Clovis Janitorial) were sterile filtered and stored as 200 muL aliquots at 4 C.	0
Bacterial taxa Bacteroides, Alistipes, Eubacterium, Xylanophylum, and @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ are associated with the production of @sm$ p-cresol @/sm$, while Bacteroides, Ruminococcus torques, Blautia, Dialister, and Butyricicoccus are associated with the production of indole.	1
Bacteriological cultures and identification of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ isolates were performed as described in the accompanying paper. Briefly, various reference @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species were used as positive controls for genetic and bacteriological identification of samples. According to the National Brucellosis Control Program of the CR-NAHS, seropositive sheep, goats, buffalos or pigs are selected for obligatory culling and pathological examination. Necropsies were carried out at the Pathology Department in the Veterinary School of the National University, CR. Animal samples, included milk and other secretions such as vaginal swabs, semen and cerebrospinal fluid. Tissues samples included reproductive organs lymph nodes, spleen, kidney, liver and brain. In some cases aborted fetuses were also collected and sampled. Cultures were performed at the CR-NAHS or at the Bacteriology Laboratory of the Veterinary School. Non-selective and selective media, including blood agar and Columbia agar, supplemented with 5% of dextrose and sheep blood as well as Modified @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ Selective Supplement Oxoid  (SR0209) and CITA medium, under 10% CO2 atmosphere, were used. The selected bacterial colonies were subjected to Gram staining, agglutination with @sm$ acriflavine @/sm$ and acridine orange dyes, tested for urease and oxidase activity, citrate utilization, nitrate reduction, H2S production, growth in the presence of CO2, thionin (20 mug/mL) and basic fuchsin (20 mug/mL) and uptake of crystal violet, according to described procedures.	3
Bacteroides caecimuris, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, Clostridium bolteae, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Veillonella parvula were enriched in NAFLD-HCC relative to non-NAFLD controls. These five bacterial species had the ability to synthesize SCFAs. As a result, the levels of acetylphosphate and @sm$ oxaloacetate @/sm$ were markedly higher in feces from NAFLD-HCC patients than in non-NAFLD controls. Butyrate, malonate, and propionate were upregulated in serum samples from NAFLD-HCC patients compared to non-NAFLD controls. Intestinal microbiota from NAFLD-HCC induced the expansion of IL-10+ Treg cells and reduced the expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Particularly, B. caecimuris, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, and C. bolteae were positively associated with effector IL-10+ Treg cells, and B. caecimuris, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, R.	0
Based on earlier reports of the related @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ lethal toxin, also a member of the large clostridial toxins, we anticipated TcdB-GTD to catalyze glucosylation of Rho GTPases with retention of stereochemistry. TcdB-GTD was incubated with Rac1 and [1-13C glucose]UDP-glucose, and the C1-H anomeric peak corresponding to glucosylated @sm$ threonine @/sm$ of Rac1 was monitored (Figure 2b).	0
Based on longitudinally tracking the gut microbiota during treatment, the gut microbial diversity (alpha or beta) did not significantly differ over time, except for beta diversity being greater between baseline and month 6 than between baseline and month 1 in the @sm$ LEF @/sm$ group ( Figures S5A, B  and  Table S12 ). In the HQT group, 11 species and 9 MetaCyc metabolic pathways significantly changed over time (based on the Jonckheere-Terpstra test), with 4 species (C. somerae, Haemophilus aegyptius, Dialister succinatiphilus, and C. celatum) being restored by the late stage of HQT treatment ( Figure 4A  and  Table S5 ). Additionally, as HQT treatment progressed, the abundances of Roseburiaw inulinivorans, Turicibacter sanguinis, and Pasteurella bettyae significantly increased while Clostridium symbiosum and Clostridiales bacterium 1-7-47FAA significantly decreased ( Figure 4A  and  Table S5 ). In the HQT group, bacterial purine degradation (PWY0-1297 and PWY-6353) was decreased and amino acid biosynthesis (VALSYN-PWY and ILEUSYN-PWY) was increased over time ( Figure 4B  and  Table S6 ). In the @sm$ LEF @/sm$ group, only 4 species and 2 MetaCyc metabolic pathways significantly changed over time (based on the Jonckheere-Terpstra test), but their abundances were very low in both groups ( Figure S6 ,  Tables S13  and  S14 ). However, the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. known as the dominant gut microbiota in RA patients was not significantly different in both the HQT-treated and @sm$ LEF @/sm$-treated groups. Thus, there were few changes over time in the relative abundance of gut microbiota species in the @sm$ LEF @/sm$ group, but many changes in the HQT group.	3
Based on our data, we speculate that @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ enhances mucus production via the secretion of microbial metabolites such as @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and GABA. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ does not contain the genes responsible for generating butyrate or propionate, but it is capable of synthesizing @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (KEGG). As such, we speculate that the MUC2-modulating effects of @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ may be due in part to @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production. @sm$ Acetate @/sm$ may work through multiple pathways. According to single-cell sequencing of mouse intestinal epithelium, the acetate receptor GPR43 (also known as FFAR2) is highly expressed in goblet cells (Single Cell Portal; Broad Institute), and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ may directly modulate GPR43 to stimulate MUC2 production. Additionally, @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is known to lower the intestinal pH, and the organization of MUC2 in goblet cells is triggered by low pH. Moreover, enteroendocrine cells in the intestine can be stimulated by low pH or GPR43 activation to secrete serotonin, which is also known to influence goblet cells. In addition to @sm$ acetate @/sm$, it is possible that @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ secretes other products that regulate MUC2 production. Another lactic acid-producing bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, secretes a 40-kDa protein, termed p40, which has 27 to 78% homology with CHAP domain-containing proteins secreted by various Bifidobacterium strains, including @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$. These compounds may also be involved in @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$-mediated mucin modulation.	1
Based on their impact, @sm$ glycine @/sm$, serine, and threonine metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; and cysteine and methionine metabolism were the top three enriched metabolic pathways. All of these pathways are related to amino acid metabolism. The metabolites involved in each enriched pathway are listed in Fig. 4B. All metabolites in the @sm$ glycine @/sm$, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway were higher in low-virulent than high-virulent @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ strains, while most metabolites were lower in the aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway, and half of the metabolites were either higher or lower in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway (Fig. 4B). These findings highlight the significance of @sm$ glycine @/sm$, serine, and threonine metabolism in distinguishing between high-virulent and low-virulent strains.	3
Because high-density @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ spp. show no change in viability or gene expression when exposed to @sm$ HGA @/sm$, we hypothesized that the mechanisms of high-density tolerance could be due to differences between high- and low-density cells prior to @sm$ HGA @/sm$ exposure. Between HD- and LD- conditions, there were 78 genes significantly upregulated in high-density cells and 5 genes upregulated in low-density cells. @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ exhibits a biphasic lifestyle and is known to upregulate flagellar biosynthesis and virulence gene expression in stationary phase, downstream of the stringent response pathway. The predominant transcriptional profile of genes upregulated in HD- cells was consistent with this flagellar regulon activation. Twenty-one of the 78 upregulated HD- genes were flagellar (in flagellar gene classes II, III, and IV) or previously characterized as part of the fliA flagellar regulon. If we relax our significance threshold to P < 0.05, 60% of all flagellar-related genes in the genome (34 of 57) were upregulated in HD- as compared to LD- conditions (Table S1). Relatedly, nine characterized virulence genes (i.e., toxins or effectors) were upregulated in HD- conditions. While this was the major transcriptional signature, we previously showed that HGA susceptibility was unaffected by mutations to the stringent response pathway, which are expected to perturb activation of the flagellar regulon. Therefore, we predict that @sm$ HGA @/sm$ tolerance is more likely to be conferred by one or more of the remaining, non-flagellar genes upregulated in high-density cells.	4
Before initiating drug combination assays, the MIC values for both compounds were determined against @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ (Sf2457T), Salmonella (St14028), and E. coli (EcDH5a) isolates. Standard checkerboard titration method using isobolograms was used to study the in vitro interaction between Tebipenem and azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, @sm$ ceftriaxone @/sm$, mecillinam and an LpxC inhibitor.	3
Besides the (286)DXD(288) motif and Trp(102), which were shown to be necessary for Mn(2+) and UDP binding, respectively, we identified by alanine scanning Asp(270), @sm$ Arg @/sm$(273), Tyr(284), Asn(384), and Trp(520) as being important for enzyme activity. The amino acids @sm$ Arg @/sm$(455), Asp(461), Lys(463), and Glu(472) and residues of helix alpha17 (e.g. Glu(449)) of toxin B are essential for enzyme-protein substrate recognition. Introduction of helix alpha17 of toxin B into @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ lethal toxin inhibited modification of Ras subfamily proteins but enabled glucosylation of RhoA, indicating that helix alpha17 is involved in RhoA recognition by toxin B.	0
Besides, Bacteroides fragilis group synthesizes @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$), an important bacterial virulence factor. Usually, increased numbers of Bacteroidetes are found in fecal samples of children affected by GI inflammatory diseases and AD. This study also showed that almost all identified Sutterellaceae (Parasutterella genus) and Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Proteus, Shigella) were at higher levels in fecal samples of AD children compared to PDD-NOS and HC. The content of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species decreased in fecal samples of AD. @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species were demonstrated to have species- and strain-specific influence on immunity. Various species of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ synthesize exopolysaccharides, which act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.	1
Beyond the addition of vegetable juice or extracts to reduce the residual @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ in meat or meat products, some microbes also showed @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ reduction and conversion effects (Table 5). Microbial enzymes can convert metmyoglobin to NO-Mb, thereby making the cured meat pink. added Lactobacillus fermentum RC4 and L. plantarum B6, without any @sm$ nitrite @/sm$, during preparation of cured meat, producing a bright color and low @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ content. adopted three staphylococcal species (S. vitulinus, S. carnosus, and S. equorum) to induce the production of NO-Mb through nitric oxide synthase catalysis, which, in all three species, increased the a* value of the dry sausage model. inoculated Lactobacillus curvatus LAB26 and Pediococcus pentosaceus SWU73571, isolated from the sour meat of the Dong minority in China, into sour meat. Both bacteria decreased the @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ content of sour meat and increased the a* value significantly. added Lactobacillus fermentum AS1.1880 into pork batters and confirmed that the species increased their redness by producing nitric oxide synthase. found that Lactobacillus fermentum RC4 significantly reduced the @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ content of salted meat. They combined Lactobacillus fermentum RC4 and L. plantarum B6 with beet red, Monascus red, and nisin to produce Chinese bacon, and found that the combined agents not only improved the cured meat quality, but also decreased the @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ content. used the commercial starter PRO-MIX5 (@gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ xylose, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum) to prepare bacon and found that the starter resulted in significantly lower NDMA and total N-nitrosamine levels.	2
Bifidobacteria are Gram-positive saccharolytic bacteria whose genome is rich in guanine and cytosine (@sm$ G + C @/sm$). The vast majority of bifidobacteria are strict anaerobes, but some of them are microaerophilic such as B. psychraerophilum, @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ and B.	0
Bifidobacterium infantis colonization in rats modulated the bioavailability of tryptophan by yielding increased concentrations of tryptophan in plasma, reduced @sm$ 5-HIAA @/sm$ (@sm$ hydroxyindoleacetic acid @/sm$) concentrations in the frontal cortex, and diminished quantities of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the amygdaloid cortex. Gut microbial populations in SPF mice modulated brain development by contributing to suppressed expression of postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 and synaptophysin in the striatum compared to germ-free mice. Treatment with @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species resulted in normalization of the immune response, reversal of behavioral deficits, and restoration of basal noradrenaline concentrations in the brainstem, thereby alleviating depression of the CNS. In addition, orally gavaged BALB/c mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) reduced GABAAalpha2 gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but increased GABAAalpha2 gene expression in the hippocampus. These findings provide evidence that Lactobacillus strains regulate emotions, behavior and central GABA receptor expression. Intestinal microbiota may modulate the bioavailability of tryptophan in the intestine, and may in turn influence availability of neurotransmitters such as serotonin in the host. Non-digestible carbohydrates can be fermented in the lumen resulting in production of SCFAs such as lactate, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate. These metabolically active SCFAs are involved in various biological processes as an energy source in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. Additionally, fermentation of prebiotic carbohydrates such as inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides has been shown to increase the proportion of beneficial microbes like @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp.	1
Bifidobacterium is a genus of high @sm$ G + C @/sm$ Gram-positive eubacteria within the phylum of Actinobacteria. They are saccharolytic obligate anaerobes whose primary habitat is the gastrointestinal tract of animals, being among the first gut colonizers. Among nearly fifty species recognized so far, the most represented in the gastrointestinal tract of human adults or infants, are Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$, B.	0
Bifidobacterium, a Gram-positive bacterium with a high @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content, was initially discovered by Tissier in 1899 in the feces of breast-fed infants and was subsequently classified under Actinobacteria. It is one of the most common bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals. Common bifidobacteria species in humans include B. adolescentis, @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, B.	0
Biochemical test showed positive urease, catalase and oxidase test but negative for @sm$ H2S @/sm$ and citrate test. The results of this test ensure that isolated bacteria was @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$.	4
Biofilm formation of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ was first assessed using microtiter plate assays. Overnight cultures of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ were diluted to 1:100 in TYE broth with 1% sucrose, and 200 mul of each culture were inoculated into wells of sterile 96-well @sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ microtiter plates (Nunc) and incubated at 37  C in 5% CO2 for 16 h. The optical density of cells at 470 nm was used to monitor bacterial growth. The biofilm formation on each well was stained with 0.1% crystal violet and measured at 562 nm as previously described. Biofilm formation was also evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The 1:100 diluted overnight cultures of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ strains were transferred into wells of sterile mu-Slide 8-well plates (ibidi).	0
Biofilm formation was assessed in a 96-well microtiter plate assay using minimal medium M9 (6 g/l Na2HPO4, 3 g/l KH2PO4, 0.5 g/l NaCl, 1 g/l NH4Cl, 2 mM @sm$ MgSO4 @/sm$, 0.1% glucose, and 0.1 mM CaCl2). After overnight growth at 37 C in tryptic soy broth medium (TSB; Beijing Land Bridge Technology Ltd., Beijing, China), 200 mul @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ cell suspension was transferred into each microtiter well and incubated at 37 C for 72 h.	3
Both @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ and Blautia are SCFA-producing genera. In our study, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ was enriched in both the control and ACS-statins groups but depleted in the ACS group. In addition, it was negatively correlated with indicators of disease severity. @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ is a Gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to produce @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$. Zeevi et al.'s research on gut microbiota genomic structural variants (SVs) uncovered that a region in @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ that encodes a composite inositol catabolism-butyrate biosynthesis pathway is associated with low host metabolic risk assessed by BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, etc. The authors hypothesized that by processing this SV, bacteria demonstrated increased symbiosis with the host. In the current study, we found a significant negative correlation between @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ (ASV334 and ASV408) and the waistline, which is consistent with the previous report.	1
Both @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ and L. crispatus produced both isomers. @sm$ l-Lactic acid @/sm$ production by L. jensenii was below the level of detection. A similar situation was observed for the production of @sm$ d-lactic acid @/sm$ by L. iners. However, for this species, the lack of detection of this isomer constitutes corroborative evidence that this species may in fact be unable to produce @sm$ d-lactic acid @/sm$.	1
Both C.catus and @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$ showed gene expression for fructan degradation, and @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$ also showed gene expression starch and arabinoxylan degradation modules (Fig. 5b). For organic acid metabolism, at 24 h, expression of genes for acetate, @sm$ lactate @/sm$, butyrate and propionate production modules was dominated by R.intestinalis, B.ovatus, B.xylanisolvens, E.siraeum, and A.rectalis (Fig. 5c). At 48 h, @gm$ S.variabile @/gm$, F.plautii and C.catus showed higher expression of genes for organic acid metabolism modules (Fig.	1
Briefly, @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ P6CDO-S1 strain was grown on HBA plates for 48 hours under AnaeroH2- and AnaeroH2+ conditions, respectively. @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ bacteria were collected and washed with PBS and then 19 mug whole cell proteins were separated on 12% @sm$ SDS @/sm$-PAGE as described previously.	3
Briefly, a loopful of each isolate grown on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar was suspended in 50 muL of sterile distilled @sm$ water @/sm$ on a glass slide, and then mixed with one drop of each antiserum. The slide was rotated gently for 1 min, and observed for appearance of any agglutination reaction using indirect lighting over a dark background. However, some strains (S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$) may possess capsular polysaccharide antigen, known as Vi, that render the strains non-agglutinable in O-antisera.	3
Briefly, after deparaffination and rehydratation, tissue slides were incubated for 3 h in the hybridization buffer (with a specific temperature and amount of @sm$ formamide @/sm$ depending on each probe) with FISH probes targeting most of bacteria universally (EUB probe) in combination with probes targeting one of the following species specifically: @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Additional file 1: Table S1).	3
Brown algae @sm$ glycan @/sm$ from Laminaria japonica (LJNP) is a heterogeneous @sm$ glycan @/sm$ with two apparent molecular weights of 1.1 and 37.3 kDa, and is mainly composed of alpha beta-glucan and a few fucosyl residues. To explore the regulation of gut microbiota and the host, LJNP and 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) were compared to investigate their effect on mice via oral administration. Using metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, we found that 2'FL mainly relied on @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ and Akkermansia muciniphila to improve gut amino acid and bile acid metabolism, whereas LJNP mainly drove Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis to regulate gut amino acid metabolism and glycometabolism.	2
Buruli ulcer is a common ulceration found in tropical Africa, New Guinea, Malaysia, and Australia caused by @gm$ mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$; see Table 1 (2). @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ represents the third most common mycobacterial disease in intertropical areas. Clinical features consist of small mobile skin nodules that generally enlarge over days to weeks; lesions may resolve spontaneously but most will progress. Lesions generally are not painful and have no systemic inflammatory response. Eventually the papule breaks down at the center and forms an ulcer. Diagnosis consists of positive acid-fast bacilli culture from necrotic ulcer; PCR testing and punch biopsies can also be performed. Treatment of ulcer involves surgery to debride necrotic tissue. @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ is generally sensitive to clarithromycin, rifampicin, and @sm$ ethambutol @/sm$.	3
Butyrate consumption decreases the pH in the colon, which stimulates the abundance of some bacteria, e.g., @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$. These bacteria promote mucin secretion within the mucus layer, which increases the abundance of A. muciniphila. Akkermensia degrades the mucus, leading to a release of @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ and the production of propionate and acetate.	2
By contrast, no such difference in the stimulating effect of kestose on the @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ group count was observed between the younger and older subgroups, which had a low count in the younger subgroup. Moreover, in a clinical study to examine the effect of @sm$ inulin @/sm$ in the gut microbiota, no increase was found in the @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ group, while a significant increase in other Bifidobacterium species, including B. adolescentis and B. bifidum, was observed. Taken together, fructans such as @sm$ inulin @/sm$ and kestose might not be utilized so efficiently by the B.	2
By reviewing previous case reports, we found that the most commonly used antibiotic for treating Prevotella oris-induced infection was metronidazole, while other antibiotics included piperacillin-tazobactam, @sm$ ampicillin/sulbactam @/sm$, levaquin, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. For the documented Prevotella oris-induced and @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$-induced cervical spinal epidural abscess and meningitis cases, fosfomycin, ceftriaxone and metronidazole were used for targeted therapy (Table 1).	3
C57BL/6J mice were daily gavaged with 0.2 mL of either sterile @sm$ PBS @/sm$ or @sm$ PBS @/sm$ containing 10(8) colony-forming units of B. bifidum MIMBb75 for 2 weeks, after which intestinal contents and fecal samples were analyzed for microbial compositional changes. Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 was able to transiently colonize the murine intestine, with the predominant niche being the ceco-proximal colonic region. Region-specific effects on host microbiota were observed including decreased levels of @gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ in the cecum, increased levels of bifidobacteria in the proximal and distal colon, total bacteria and Clostridium leptum in the proximal colon, and of C.	3
CAZymes involved in the degradation of amorphous cellulose, @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ and mixed-linkage glucans were encoded by at least 50 % of the MAGs (Table S9). The greatest number of CAZymes and CAZyme families were found in MAGs classified as   @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$  , Parabacteroides faecavium,   Phocaeicola plebeius  ,   Phocaeicola vulgatus   and   Prevotella   sp004554665 (Table S10).	2
CNCM 12744, that produces EPS-containing fucose, galactose, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, and glucuronic acid monomers. Freitas et al. found that Enterobacter strain A47 (DSM 23139) produced a fucose-containing EPS. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are mesophiles that have been long known to produce EPS. Among their genera, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$, L.	1
CO2 has been shown to be the substrate of the CODH from @gm$ Peptostreptococcus productus @/gm$ rather than biocarbonate or @sm$ carbonate @/sm$.	2
CO2 production from glucose test was applied, in order to determine the homo/heterofermentative characterization of @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ F2. @sm$ Citrate @/sm$ lacking MRS broth and inverted Durham tubes were prepared and inoculated with 1% overnight fresh culture. Test tubes were then incubated at 37  C for 3 days. Gas occurrence in Durham tubes was observed during 3 days, which is the evidence for CO2 production from glucose. This test was further checked out according to the method described by on homofermentative-heterofermentative differential (HHD) medium. @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ F2 was streaked on HHD plates and incubate at 37  C for 24-72 h.	0
CPPD crystals were evidenced in 5 patients, including 1 who also had hydroxyapatite crystals detected by electron microscopy after @sm$ alizarin red @/sm$ staining. Monosodium urate crystals were found in 1 patient. The remaining patient had both CPPD crystals and positive cultures for @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$.	0
CPSs of serotypes 3, 7, 8, and 9, on the other hand, are structurally well diversified among themselves and from those of the previous four serotypes: they do not possess sialic acid, some contain phosphates in their backbone, and others contain unusual sugars such as di-N-acetylbacillosamine (QuiNAc4NAc), 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-acetylfucosamine (Fuc2NAc4N), @sm$ glucitol @/sm$, and a 4-keto sugar (6dxyloHexNAc-4-ulose) (Fig. 1). In addition, the CPS of S. suis serotype 8 has been shown to be identical to that of @gm$ S. pneumoniae @/gm$ serotype 19F (Fig.	0
Ca2+ i responses to denatonium benzoate, thujone, and @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ 3-oxo-C12HSL were also blocked by heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor YM254890 (Fig. S6D-G). Consistent with GPCR-induced PLC activation, Ca2+ i responses to denatonium benzoate and quinine were also blocked with inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) inhibitor @sm$ xestospongin C @/sm$ (Fig.	3
Calculated end-product yields reveal that the Caldicellulosiruptor, Pyrococcus, Thermococcus, and Thermotoga species surveyed, produced, in most cases, near-maximal H2 yields with concomitant CO2 and acetate production, and little or no ethanol, @sm$ formate @/sm$, and lactate. It is important to note that while some studies report lower overall end-product yields, likely due to a large amount of carbon flux being directed towards biomass production under a given growth condition, H2:ethanol ratios remain high. Cal. subterraneus subsp. tengcongensis, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$, and Clostridium species displayed mixed end-product fermentation patterns, with comparatively lower H2, CO2, and acetate yields, higher ethanol yields, and generally low @sm$ formate @/sm$ and lactate yields. Ta. pseudethanolicus produced the highest ethanol yields of the organisms surveyed with little concomitant H2, acetate, and lactate production, and no @sm$ formate @/sm$ synthesis. G. thermoglucosidasius and B. cereus produced the highest lactate and @sm$ formate @/sm$ yields, moderate ethanol and acetate yields, and low H2 and CO2 yields.	1
Calves fed MR plus four antibiotics (0.024 mg/L penicillin, 0.025 mg/L streptomycins, 0.1 mg/L tetracyclines, and 0.33 mg/L ceftiofur) had a reduced and higher richness of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. and Acetitomaculum spp., respectively, at the genus level. As a result, residual antibiotics administered to raw WM calves enhanced rumen fermentation, ruminal papillae growth, and increased rumen acetic acid production. The relative abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp., one of the most diverse and core flora at the genus level, was reduced by antibiotic residues, possibly due to their sensitivity to a penicillin and tetracycline antibiotics. Antibiotics such as monensin, gentamicin, virginithromycin, ampicillin, ceftriazine, penicillin, and oxytetracycline are routinely used to treat mastitis in dairy cows. @sm$ Chlortetracycline @/sm$, oxytetracycline, tylosin, and monensin have been demonstrated to prevent rumen bacteria from breaking down cellulose and producing VFA in vivo. In addition, ampicillin, ceftriazine, penicillin and oxytetracycline inclusion in calf milk can affect the fecal microbial population composition. A recent study supported the idea that gentamicin inhibits Prevotella intermedia. The abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp.	3
Carbapenemase-producing @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ was identified and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), immune colloidal gold technique, a conjugation experiment, PCR analysis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The genome of @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ was determined by whole genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ was resistant to @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, meropenem, ertapenem, cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, sulbactam/cefoperazone, ceftazidime/avibactam, cefepime, and aztreonam while susceptible to polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, tigecycline, and amikacin. Immune colloidal gold technique suggested that this strain co-produced three different carbapenemases [Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), and @sm$ Imipenem @/sm$ (@sm$ IMP @/sm$)]. Whole genome sequencing analysis indicated that this strain belonged to ST91, and bla KPC-2, bla NDM-1, and bla IMP-4 were carried on different conjugative plasmids. Besides, the co-existence and transferability of bla KPC-2, bla NDM-1, and bla IMP-4 in @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ facilitates the potential horizontal dissemination and nosocomial spread of resistance genes among multidrug-resistant organisms.	4

Carbohydrate utilization associated genes transcription are the essential indicators for investigating the capabilities of @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ degradation. The mid-log phase was chosen for transcription analysis, as a latest research suggested that more genes at this time-point would be involved in breaking down @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ than at the late-log phase. The positive effect of xylan on isolating low-abundant Bacteroidales from biological samples was, to some extent, verified by the transcriptomics profiles, as the substantial amount of the upregulated genes for more than fivefold with predicted functions of GH, esterase and transferase were identified in P. copri ELH-XY3 and @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ HCM-XY17 relative to the cultivation in xylose. In particular, the PcopriGM000867 encoding endo-1, 4-beta-xylanase, and PcopriGM000851, 0852, 860, 0867, and 2978 encoding acetyl xylan esterase, as the crucial enzymes during depolymerization of xylan, were prominently upregulated in P. copri. Moreover, the significantly repressed xylan hydrolysis-associated genes revealed in B. uniformis HCM-XY15 were in accordance with the impaired growth conditions in the cf-xylan medium and may demonstrate the less priority of xylan as energetic source for B. uniformis compared to P. copri and @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$.	2
Carvacrol and @sm$ thymol @/sm$, for example, inhibited the growth of the bacterium Listeria innocua more effectively in combination than alone . Carvacrol was also more effective against the bacterium @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ when combined with cymene, although cymene alone had no antimicrobial activity .	3
Case 12 had ESBL-Proteus mirabilis infection, Cases 13 and 14 had multi-drug resistant (MDR) @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. infections, and Case 16 had ceftazidime- and @sm$ cefepime @/sm$-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.	4
"Cassia fistula is well known for its laxative properties due to @sm$ anthraquinone @/sm$ compounds (rhein, aloe-emodin) in the pods. The anti-microbial activity of rhein (7.8-31.25 mug ml-1) against ""methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)"" strains have already been explored. Azelmat et al. reported rhein for its potential to impair bacterial pathogenicity by reducing the transcriptional gene expression of periodontopathogenic bacterium @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$.

Catechins (34), pinocembrin, kaempferol, EGCG (20), gallocatechin gallate (26), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (62), genistein (31), quercetin glycoside (63), and @sm$ proanthocyanidins @/sm$ (27) (Figure 2) are suggested to neutralize bacterial toxic factors initiating from V. cholerae, E. coli, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, B. anthracis, N. gonorrhoeae, and @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$.	3
Causative agents identified in cases of gastrointestinal disease included @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and diarrheagenic E. coli, with Giardia intestinalis being the most frequently observed parasitic infection (Table 3). Three cases of irritable bowel syndrome and one case of drug-induced (@sm$ atovaquone @/sm$/proguanil) diarrhea were also observed.	0
Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ (10(8) CFU/ml). @gm$ B. longum @/gm$, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-@sm$ sulphur @/sm$-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$.	3
Cells of @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ strain XL1-Blue expressing the mCherry RFP or GFP were added to macrophages at an MOI of 10 for 1 hr at 37 C. The culture supernatant was replaced with fresh tissue culture medium containing 100 microg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria. After 1 hr of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 microg/ml gentamicin. At indicated time points, cells were washed extensively (5x) with warm PBS and lysed with 0.02% @sm$ saponin @/sm$.	3
Certain gut microbial features, e.g., Blautia wexlerae, Bacteroides dorei, @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio, and bacterial metabolites, e.g., choline and @sm$ L-carnitine @/sm$, have been recently reported to associate body weight response to dietary interventions.	0
Certain mammals can produce @sm$ proline @/sm$ rich antimicrobial peptides those show profound antimicrobial activity by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Mammalian milk is an important source of AMPs. Lactalbumin, beta-Lactoglobulin, lactoferrin and many others function as potent antibacterial compound. For example, beta-Casein 211-225 from human milk was found to show high activity against E.coli and @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$.	3
Changes in @sm$ P @/sm$-related metabolic pathways in the ileum were similar to those in the crop. The composition of the microbial community varied among treatments. ANOVA analyses of relative abundances of single OTUs revealed significant interactions for five OTUs (1, 5, 7, 8, and 20; Table S5). However, an assessment of the contribution of these microorganisms to InsP degradation is difficult to derive because the phosphatase activity of the associated microorganisms is either not yet described in the literature or the OTUs define only classes of strains. Therefore, it cannot be estimated whether these microorganisms contributed phosphatase to a relevant extent. Nonetheless, results indicated that microorganisms in the digestive tract have contributed to @sm$ P @/sm$ utilization of the birds. There were five positive correlations between pc @sm$ P @/sm$ digestibility and OTUs assigned to L. reuteri and @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$; these microorganisms are known to produce phosphatase.	1
Changes in the gut microbiome and microbiome-dependent metabolites, such as @sm$ trimethylamine N-oxide @/sm$ (@sm$ TMAO @/sm$), may explain differential health effects of plant-based diets. However, human data are sparse on whether qualitatively distinct types of plant-based diets differentially affect gut microbiome diversity, composition, particularly at the species level, and/or metabolites. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine cross-sectional associations of different plant-based indices with adult gut microbiome diversity, composition, and the metabolite @sm$ TMAO @/sm$. METHODS: We studied 705 adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with data for diet, fecal microbiome (shotgun metagenomic sequencing), and key covariates. We derived healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) using data from food frequency questionnaires. We examined plant-based diet indices with microbiome alpha-diversity (richness and evenness measures), beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis and UniFrac measures), composition (species level), and plasma @sm$ TMAO @/sm$. We used regression models to determine associations before and after adjustment for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking status, body mass index, and total energy intake. RESULTS: The analytic sample (mean age, 71.0 years, SD = 12.8 years) comprised 55.6% female and 67.5% non-Hispanic White participants. hPDI was positively and uPDI negatively associated with microbiome alpha-diversity, driven by microbial evenness (Pielou P < 0.05). hPDI was also positively associated with relative abundance of 3 polysaccharide-degrading bacterial species (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium eligens, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and inversely associated with 6 species (Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Doreasp CAG 317, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Sellimonas intestinalis, Blautia wexlerae, and @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$). Furthermore, hPDI was inversely associated with @sm$ TMAO @/sm$.	2
Chemical analysis of the cell wall of the type strain of @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ (@gm$ ATCC 8486 @/gm$T) shows the presence of the amino sugars N-acetylmuramic acid (2.9 % dry weight), N-acetylglucosamine (2.1 %) and N-acetylgalactosamine (3.9 %) together with larger amounts of rhamnose (20.4 %), glucose and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ (together 14.9 %).	2
Chitin deacetylase (CDA, EC 3.5.1.41), belonging to a family of extracellular @sm$ chitin @/sm$-modifying enzymes, can catalyze the deacetylation of @sm$ chitin @/sm$. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence encoding chitin deacetylase 1 (EcCDA1) was obtained fromExopalaemon carinicauda. The complete nucleotide sequence of EcCDA1 contained a 1611 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding EcCDA1 precursor of 536 amino acids. The domain architecture of the deduced EcCDA1 protein contained a signal peptide, a chitin-binding peritrophin-A domain (ChtBD2), a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain (LDLa) and a Polysacc_deac_1 domain. EcCDA1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the gills. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ changed in a time-dependent manner. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with V. parahaemolyticus was up-regulated at 12 h (p < 0.05), and significantly up-regulated at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.01), and then returned to the control levels at 96 h post-challenge (p > 0.05). At the same time, the expression in Aeromonas-challenged group was significantly up-regulated at 12, 24 and 48 h (p < 0.01) and returned to the control levels at 120 h post-challenge (p > 0.05). Then, EcCDA1 was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified recombinant EcCDA1 could not inhibit the growth of V. parahaemolyticus or @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$, which indicated that the CDA1 may play its biological activity in immune defense by deacetylation from @sm$ chitin @/sm$.	2
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), @sm$ copper chloride @/sm$ (@sm$ CuCl2 @/sm$), PEI, VcNa, trisodium citrate, biotin-3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester sodium salt, SA, procalcitonin (PCT), human serum albumin (HSA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO). The sample pad, NC membrane, and an absorbent pad were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell GmbH (Dassel, Germany). Anti-p24 cAbs (5.0 mg mL-1) and dAbs (6.4 mg mL-1) were provided by Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-E. coli @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ dAbs (2 mg mL-1) and cAbs (2 mg mL-1), goat anti-mouse IgG (10 mg mL-1), and BSA were purchased from Meridian Life Science, Inc (Memphis, TN, USA).	0
Chlorogenic acid and @sm$ caffeic acid @/sm$, the predominant phenolic acid in coffee, can modify the gut microbiota structure, reducing intestinal and systemic inflammation in colitis. Notably, in the colon, chlorogenic acid is hydrolyzed into @sm$ caffeic acid @/sm$ metabolite by mucosal and microbial esterase in the intestinal tract. Both chlorogenic and caffeic acids significantly increased the relative abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ and the microbial richness, in addition to reducing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota in mice with DSS-induced colitis (Table 5). For instance, the effects of dietary @sm$ caffeic acid @/sm$ (1 mM, CaA) administered for 15 days on murine experimental colitis were shown to contribute to coping with DSS-induced intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dislocations. CaA significantly suppressed inflammatory markers, such as the secretion of IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma and the colonic infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD177+ neutrophils, and F4/80+ macrophages. Furthermore, @sm$ caffeic acid @/sm$ has been shown to hamper the abundance of inflammatory Ruminococcaceae species.	3
Choleraesuis isolates displayed high resistance to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, ticarcillin, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and gentamicin; importantly, all these isolates were from hospitalized diarrhea patients. About 80% of H2S-negative S. Gallinarum isolates were resistant to ticarcillin and ampicillin. In addition, H2S-negative S. Give, S. Derby, and S. Meleagridis were resistant to seven, three, and two antibiotics, respectively. All H2S-negative S. Paratyphi A, @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$, S.	4
Chronic cycler peritoneal dialysis (PD; 14 h/day, 40 ml/kg Physioneal 40 2.27%, 10 dwells) was initiated, and the initial treatment included @sm$ sodium citrate @/sm$ (to reduce the risk of further calcium oxalate crystallization), pyridoxine (vitamin B6; 3 x 10 mg/kg/day), recombinant erythropoietin (2000 IU, 2-3 times/week), and fortified nutrition to promote weight gain. At the age of 10 weeks, progressive oliguria (0.6 mL/kg/h) occurred. Three weeks after the initiation of daily nocturnal PD, additional hemodialysis (HD) was initiated (3 times/week, 3 h per session, blood flow 50 ml/min, dialysate flow 300 ml/min, filter FXPaed) to further eliminate oxalate. Before initiation of dialysis, free Pox levels of 120-130 mumol/L (mass spectrometry, normal values: < 21 mumol/l) were stabilized but not reduced by the treatment. Following the initiation of dialysis, Pox was reduced by 80% as compared to pre-dialysis levels. Seven weeks after hospital admission (age: 15 weeks), treatment with lyophilized @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ genotype 1, strain HC-1 (Oxabact OC5) was initiated. Oxabact OC5 is not approved for treatment of PH1 but was requested by the treating physician under a named patient use treatment approach. The Oxabact OC5 treatment consisted of >= 109 colony forming unit/dose twice daily, dissolved in 7 mL of @sm$ sodium citrate @/sm$ buffer to facilitate administration to the infant.	2
Citrate lyase from @gm$ Klebsiella aerogenes @/gm$ inactivated by reaction in the presence of substrate or by treatment with @sm$ hydroxylamine @/sm$ can be reactivated with acetic anhydride only if its sulfhydryl groups are reduced.	3
Class A scavenger receptor, cholesterol, and ganglioside GM1 facilitated entry in macrophages is reported for @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and B. canis (Refer Figure 1). Another intracellular, zoonotic, Gram-negative, and facultative pathogen, Francisella tularensis, has been reported to have inhibited entry upon removal of GPI-anchored protein due to the destabilization of cholesterol/@sm$ sphingosine @/sm$.	3
Clinical isolates of @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ were obtained from Department of Medical Microbiology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, India. The strains were routinely grown in Luria- Bertani (LB) broth (Himedia, Mumbai, India) at 37 C overnight. Wistar strain male albino rats weighing 120-150 g obtained from TANUVAS, Madhavaram, Chennai. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animals Ethics Committee (IAEC) of University of Madras, INDIA, (approval no IAEC No. 011/02/2011). This study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The rat ileal loop ligation assay was carried out by the method as previously described. Male Wistar albino rats were fasted for 24 hr prior to experimentation and the animals were anaesthetized with Ketamine/@sm$ Xylazine @/sm$ (90/10 mg/kg body weight). A Small midline incision (1-5 cm) was made down the abdomen exposing intestine. Loops were formed in the intestine with the silk thread at the ileocaecal junction. Inocula of 109 CFU in 0.5 ml of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, were injected into ligated ileal loops. A total of nine male Wistar rats were used. Three male Wistar rats in each group were infected with @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ at ileal section, allowed to live and sacrificed at 4 hr and 8 hr.	3
Clostridium clusters IV (including Faecalibacterium prausnitzzi, Subdonigranulum variabile and @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$) and XIVa (including Roseburia intestinalis and Ruminococcus torques) produce primarily butyrate. Among these species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzzi and Subdonigranulum variabile were not significantly different between LA and CON (Table 7), whereas Roseburia intestinalis and Ruminococcus torques were significantly higher in LA (Fig 3). Differences in the abundance of @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ between the two groups were not analyzed for its low abundance (Table 6). Faecalibacterium prausnitzzi has a requirement for acetate, and produces butyrate, formate and lactate. @sm$ Butyric acid @/sm$ has been shown to have an important function in protection against pathogens in poultry.	1
Coenzyme Q shows some structural similarity to piericidins and associates with complex @sm$ I @/sm$ during electron transport (see Fig. S2). Coenzyme Q is also sold as a dietary supplement for human consumption. Therefore, we tested the ability of coenzyme Q to inhibit type III secretion in @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$. Unlike piericidin, coenzyme Q did not inhibit YopE secretion in @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ (see Fig.	4
Colchicine was included as a known, albeit modest, inhibitor of @gm$ Mtb @/gm$ FtsZ. Rhein, Quercetin, Myrcetin, Tetracycline, and @sm$ Minocycline @/sm$ (Aldrich Chemical Company) contain planar aromatic systems and bear resemblance to Viriditoxin, a reported natural product that is active against E. coli FtsZ. Rhein and the isoflavones have also been reported to have antibacterial/antitubercular activity. The Zantrins (Z1-5) were first reported by Margalit as inhibitors of bacterial FtsZ GTPase activity. Z1-Z4 purchased from ChemBridge were included as a test to determine how well the reported GTPase activity correlates with inhibition of FtsZ polymerization as there is an apparent kinetic disconnect between GTPase effects and inhibition of polymerization. In some respects, Zantrin Z2 is similar to the aromatic cationic compounds Sanguinarine and Pseudojatorrizine. Sanguinarine has been reported to show antibacterial activity and to inhibit E. coli FtsZ assembly. Tamoxifen is a known antiestrogen drug that has effects on human tubulin and is reported to show antitubercular activity in a screen of the Prestwick collection of natural products and FDA approved drugs (see http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Compound 12, a 4-aminofurazan analog available from ChemBridge, is a reported inhibitor of E. coli FtsZ GTPase activity as well as protein polymerization in a standard light scattering assay. Compound 12 is also reported to alter Z-ring assembly in whole bacterial cells and to cause bacterial filamentation in E. coli cells. Totarol is a reported natural product that inhibits proliferation of a variety of bacteria and is reported to have activity against @gm$ Mtb @/gm$ FtsZ in vitro as well as causing bacterial filamentation although recently reported as a promiscuous aggregator. The taxanes are known drugs that alter tubulin polymerization dynamics, and analogs have been reported to show inhibition of @gm$ Mtb @/gm$ growth in vitro and are reported to show specificity for @gm$ Mtb @/gm$ FtsZ.	3
Column chromatography was performed using RediSep Rf @sm$ silica @/sm$ columns or an ODS-SM column (51 g, 50 mum, 120 A, Yamazen) on the CombiFlash  Rf 200i system. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on silica gel plates 60 GF254 (Sorbent technologies) using anisaldehyde stain for detection. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a column (100 cm x 2.5 cm) packed with BioGel P-2 Fine resins (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase, Vibrio cholerae sialidase, and @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ sialidase (CpNanH) were purchased from Prozyme (Hayward, CA, USA).	0
Communities dominated by @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ were also found to exhibit higher expression of phosphate and phosphonate transporters, consistent with a previous genome comparison that demonstrated @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ to have more phosphate/phosphonate transporters than L. iners and a previous observation of increased abundance of phosphate transport genes in the vaginal microbiota when vaginal pH is less than 4. Phosphate can buffer pH and intracellular accumulations of polyphosphate have been shown to be used by other @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. as a mechanism of acid tolerance. Although @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ has not been shown to make polyphosphate, simply sequestering phosphate may allow @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ to raise intracellular and lower extracellular pH. Similarly, we found @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ dominant communities to exhibit higher expression of a putrescine/spermidine transporter, two biogenic amines capable of buffering pH. This is consistent with the results from metabolomic studies which have found @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ dominant communities to have lower levels of @sm$ putrescine @/sm$ and higher levels of spermidine. Manipulating the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of these pH buffering compounds could be a competitive strategy utilized by @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ which allows it to inhibit the growth of competitors and facilitate its own metabolism.	2
Community analysis using pyrosequencing revealed that diverse LAB including @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$, Leuconostoc holzapfelii, Lactococcus lactis, and Weissella soli were present during the early fermentation period, but the LAB community was quickly replaced with Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc gasicomitatum, and Weissella koreensis as the fermentation progressed. Metabolite analysis using (1) H-NMR showed that organic acids (lactate, acetate, and succinate) as well as bioactive substances (mannitol and @sm$ gamma-aminobutyric acid @/sm$ (@sm$ GABA @/sm$)) were produced during the kimchi fermentation, and Leuconostoc strains and Lactobacillus sakei were identified as the producers of mannitol and @sm$ GABA @/sm$, respectively.	1
Compared with the CTL group, the relative abundance of three genera (unidentified_Clostridiales, Lactobacillus, and Anaerovorax) in CTC mice increased significantly, whereas the relative abundance of ten genera (Ruminiclostridium, Anaerotruncus, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, Desulfovibrio, Atopostipes, Peptococcus, Sporosarcina, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, Catabacter, and Jeotgalicoccus) decreased significantly (Supplementary Figure 4). High-dose CVS could reverse the relative abundance of Peptococcus, Lactobacillus, and Catabacter of mice with liver injury. The relative abundance of Peptococcus is positively correlated with @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$.	1
Comparing the expression of primary metabolic genes in vivo to growth in defined minimal media led us to hypothesize that @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ are a primary carbon source available to @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ in vivo (Figure 3). Examination of our Tn-seq data in detail (Table S4) revealed that the faoAB (or fadBA5) genes, which are required for robust growth on long-chain (C12 or greater) fatty acids, contribute to @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ fitness in vivo (Figures 4A and S3A). This was confirmed by single mutant infections: both an faoA transposon mutant and an faoA deletion mutant are attenuated in both acute and chronic wounds, indicating that long-chain fatty acids are likely an important energy source in wounds (Figure 4BC). The faoAB genes have also been shown to contribute to resistance to tobramycin, so they could potentially contribute to resistance to an unspecified chemical stress in vivo as well. However, our in vivo gene expression data suggests that growth in wound infections involves pathways active during growth on reduced carbon sources such as long-chain fatty acids (Figure 3). We did not observe an in vivo fitness defect for genes annotated as homologs of the Escherichia coli long-chain fatty acid outer membrane transporter gene fadL (fadL1, fadL2, or fadL3) in @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$; however, these genes are not thought to be required for long-chain fatty acid transport in @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ .	2
Complete pathways for pyruvate oxidation to acetyl-CoA and @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ metabolism through beta-oxidation to produce acyl-CoA were identified as unique across bovine pathogens. We previously reported BDD treponemes as serum dependent and considered whether they should be assigned as asaccharolytic akin to human T. denticola and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$.	0
Complex carbohydrates derived from diet or host (mucins) are degraded by fibrinolytic or mucinolytic bacteria, further metabolism of the hexoses and pentoses yields acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, succinate, and @sm$ lactate @/sm$. Propionate and butyrate are final products of bacterial metabolism that can be taken up by the host. Succinate can be further metabolized (for e.g., by @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$) to form propionate. Formate is a substrate for methanogenic archaea. @sm$ Lactate @/sm$ can be used by many species. For example Veillonella forms mainly acetate and propionate from @sm$ lactate @/sm$. Members of the Lachnospiraceae such as Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes spp. utilize acetate and @sm$ lactate @/sm$ to produce butyrate and also hydrogen.	2
Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited antibacterial activities against Vibrio rotiferianus and @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$. Compounds 1, 3 and 4 displayed similar anti-@sm$ methicillin @/sm$ resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) activities in comparison to chloramphenicol.	3
Compounds 52 were screened for their antibacterial activity against five Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus circulans, @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, Lysinibacillus sp.) and four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella paratyphi, Pseudomonas putida) using @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ as standard drug.	3
Concentrations of metabolites associated with energy metabolism, such as alanine, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, and mannose, are also decreased. Reduced levels of BCAAs and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ are related to a decreased abundance of Roseburia, @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$, and D.	2
Concerning Brucella species, the only published report on adherence is for @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$, where ECM molecules such as collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin and @sm$ chondroitin sulphate @/sm$ have been proposed to play an important role in Brucella spreading and invasion mechanisms to host cells and tissues.	0
Concerning ciprofloxacin, a second-generation @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ that inhibit bacterial nucleic acid synthesis, only a strain of @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ (CA7) was considered resistant, displaying a MIC value higher than 32 mug/mL.	4
Consequentially, bacterial cells from food-associated species are likely to get in contact either with @sm$ Tween 80 @/sm$ itself or its fatty acid group during enrichment in cultivation medium or in an actual food product. A prominent example for food-associated bacterial species is @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ (L.) plantarum, which is widely used in food and feed fermentations, has been claimed to have probiotic traits, but has also been associated with food spoilage.	3
Considering flow velocity and surface forces being likely to play major roles in the interaction of bacteria attached to a surface and subjected to external flow, it is reasonable to expect bacteria in general to interact with the flow in ways similar to the elongated @sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ particles. As a demonstration, two common rod-shaped bacterial strains, namely, Bacillus cereus (strain H) with dH = 0.73 +- 0.06 mum, lH = 2.16 +- 0.31 mum, and etaH = 2.95 +- 0.18, and @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica (strain @/gm$ A) with dA = 0.8 +- 0.08 mum, lA = 1.58 +- 0.40 mum, and etaA = 1.98 +- 0.25, are tested in the microfluidic channel using the aforementioned procedure.	0
Consumption of @sm$ saccharin @/sm$ and sucralose, two representatives of noncaloric artificial sweeteners, was found to disrupt the gut microbiota community, increase intestinal permeability, induce systemic inflammation and cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice, while fructooligosaccharide supplementation significantly stimulates @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ reproduction in sucralose-consuming mice, consequently ameliorating NAFLD.	3
Coriobacteriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria) is involved in metabolism of bile salts and steroid hormones as well as activation of dietary @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ in the human gut. Coriobacteriaceae was correlated positively with 15 metabolites, indicating that metabolism of Coriobacteriaceae may be a potential mechanism underlying the role of exercise in preventing disease and improving health outcomes. These increased metabolites indicate a microbiota-derived metabolism was promoted by running. At the genus level, half-marathon running reduced the abundance of fecal Ezakiella, Romboutsia, and Actinobacillus, but increased the abundance of Coprococcus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$.	1
Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) tailmeat samples were sterilized, cooled, and surface-inoculated with approximately log10 4.0 cells/g of Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC #7965) or log10 3.0 cells/g of @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ (ATCC #14029). Inoculated samples were packaged under air, vacuum, or a commercial modified atmosphere (MA) gas mix containing 80% @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ and no O2. Throughout 6 d of incubation at either 2 and 8 C ( A. hydrophila ) or 8, 11, and 14 C ( @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ ), samples were analyzed at 2 d intervals for population of the inoculum species. Slight growth of A. hydrophila occurred during air- and vacuum-storage at 2 C. No growth occurred during 2 C MA storage. At 8 C, vacuum and MA storage caused nearly equal inhibition of A. hydrophila growth. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ did not grow at 8 C under any treatment. At 11 C, MA storage effectively prevented growth of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ , while vacuum storage was slightly less inhibitory. Vacuum storage did not deter growth of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ at 14 C, but MA storage had a minor inhibitory effect.	3
Cross feeding between H2 and @sm$ formate @/sm$-producing bacteria and the human gut homoacetogen @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ has also been demonstrated in co-cultures.	2
Cross-feeding mechanisms among the more diverse faecal microbiota in @sm$ equol @/sm$ producers might further be partly responsible for the increased production of propionic and butyric acids in isoflavone-containing cultures. Acetate is the predominant SCFA produced by bacterial fermentation in the gut, and both, @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ and E.	0
Culture of mycobacteria from zebrafish is typically accomplished on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with @sm$ oleic acid @/sm$, albumin, dextrose, and catalase or Lowenstein-Jensen slants. Pretreatment with 1% cetyl pyridinium chloride prior to plating is suggested for cultures from fish tissues and strongly recommended for environmental samples to minimize background growth. Cultures are typically incubated at 28-30 C and monitored for growth for 6 to 8 weeks. Rapid growers such as @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ or M. abscessus form visible colonies within 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum grows more slowly on Middlebrook 7H10 agar, forming colonies in 10 to 14 days. Alternatives to Middlebrook 7H10 agar may be more appropriate for M. marinum; for example, used Columbia with colistin and nalidixic acid agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Mycobacterium haemophilum is the epitome of a slow-growing species, forming visible colonies in 6 to 8 weeks on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with @sm$ oleic acid @/sm$, albumin, dextrose, and catalase and 60 muM hemin.	2
"Culture-based testing for @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ was performed using buffered charcoal yeast extract-based agar (BCYE) and buffered polymyxine B, @sm$ anisomycin @/sm$, and vancomycin (BPAV) charcoal media. The plates were re-incubated at 35 C for up to 14 days and examined under a microscope daily for colonial morphology such as a mottled surface and iridescent red-blue-green sheen or a faceted cut-glass appearance. @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ growth was visible only after at least 3 days of incubation. All non-urine specimens tested for the presence of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ DNA were examined using real-time PCR with primers and probes as described in US CDC's published methodology. The PCR has two probes, one for all @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species, and one for L. pneumophila. Primers targeting the 23S-5S rRNA intergenetic spacer region conserved for all @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species were used, as previously published by US CDC. The forward and reverse primers were 5'-GTA CTA ATT GGC TGA TTG TCT TGA CC-3' and 5'-CCT GGC GAT GAC CTA CTT TCG-3', respectively. Two probes were designed within the amplicon region. One is specific for L. pneumophila (5'-Cal Flour Orange 560-ATC GTG TAA ACT CTG ACT CTT TAC CAA ACC TGT GG-3'BHQ), the other one recognizes all known @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species (5'-FAM ATC TC""G"" AA""C"" T""C""A ""G""AA ""G""T""G"" AAA C-3'BHQ) ("""" denotes locked nucleic acid), and is referred to as the genus-wide probe or @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ spp."	3
Culturing of collected samples from endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) of the mediastinal lymph node revealed growth of @gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) were positive. A diagnosis of M. kansasii infection associated with SLE was made. She was started on anti-mycobacterial and @sm$ hydroxychloroquine @/sm$ therapy and entered into a joint rheumatological and infectious disease follow-up.	3
D and L-lactates were measured from different @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species in vitro cultures and directly from stools. The medium used for the pre-cultures and cultures of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was MRS supplemented with 0.5 g/l Cys. A preculture of each species was platted on solid medium and then, individual colony of each strain was grown in MRS-Cys at 37 C in anaerobic conditions (Anaerocult A) during 24 hours. D and L-lactates were measured on 24 h in vitro culture from each strain using 1 ml of culture supernatant firstly precipitated with TCA 6 N (10%). For faecal dosage, 100 to 250 mg frozen stools were 2 fold diluted in 0.1 M @sm$ triethanolamine @/sm$ buffer (pH 9.15) and precipitated with TCA 6 N (10%).	0
Daidzeins, isoflavones from soybeans, are converted into equols by Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides ovatus, and @gm$ Ruminococcus productus @/gm$. @sm$ Lignans @/sm$ are modified by various bacteria, e.g., Clostridium scindens, Eggerthella lenta, Clostridiales, and Lactonifactor longoviformis.	0
Data from the @sm$ dalbavancin @/sm$ clinical trials, where all patients had blood cultures obtained at baseline, indicated that a total of 40 ABSSSI patients who received @sm$ dalbavancin @/sm$ had bacteremia at baseline caused by one or more of the following organisms: 26 S. aureus (21 MSSA and 5 MRSA), 6 S. agalactiae, 7 S. pyogenes, 2 @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ group, and 1 E. faecalis. Thirty-four of 40 (85.0%) patients who received @sm$ dalbavancin @/sm$ showed favorable clinical responses at 48 to 72 h and 32/40 (80.0%) were clinical successes at days 26 to 30. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of @sm$ dalbavancin @/sm$ for the treatment of BSI and cardiovascular infections have been evaluated in many observational studies and case reports.	3
Data retrieved revealed that dominance of @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ is associated with lower biodiversity expressed as species richness (average of 2 species) than L. jensenii, L. iners, and L. gasseri (average species richness of 6.8, 7.1, and 11, respectively; Fig. S1). Moreover, @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$, when present, is generally represented by a single dominant strain, with an average of 1.13 strains per biological sample of their corresponding VCSTs, while L. jensenii, L. iners, and L. gasseri showed an average of 1.75, 2.1, and 1.7 strains. These differences in species and strain biodiversity observed for the four investigated @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ taxa suggest that @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ is characterized by a more pronounced level of interspecies competition for niche colonization than other vaginal lactobacilli. These results are in accordance with recent scientific literature showing metabolic variability among @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ strains, including production and/or degradation of biogenic amines, which can raise vaginal pH and favor opportunistic pathogen colonization, and phenotypic responses to host molecules such as estrogens. Genes commonly involved in the biogenic amine production pathway are the enzyme arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19), which converts @sm$ arginine @/sm$ into putrescine, lysine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.18), which decarboxylates lysine into cadaverine, and tyrosine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.25), which converts tyrosine into tyramine. We performed a BLAST homology search using a custom database encompassing all known arginine, lysine, and tyrosine decarboxylase sequences available in public databases, which showed that the genes encoding arginine and lysine decarboxylases are conserved among all @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ strains, whereas the gene encoding tyrosine decarboxylase appears to be absent (Table S8).	1
Decreased bacteria of Clostridia mainly showed significantly positive correlations with metabolism of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$, tyrosine, lysine, methionine and cysteine. For histidine metabolism, decreased Lachnospira showed a significantly positive correlation with histidine, increased Candidatus Accumulibacter showed a significantly positive correlation with histamine, decreased Christensenellaceae R 7 group, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ group, and Intestinibacter all showed significantly negative correlations with N-acetylhistamine.	2
Degradation products of alpha-amino acids like tyrosine and phenylalanine include 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, phenol, p-cresol and @sm$ 4-ethylphenol @/sm$ as well as phenylpyruvate, phenyllactate, phenylacetate and phenylpropionate, respectively. Degradation of tryptophan generates indole, 3-methyl indole (skatole), indole acetate and indole propionate (Windey et al.). These metabolites have been found to be produced by bacterial members belonging to F. prausnitzii, @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (Li et al.).	1
Despite reducing the prevalent foodborne pathogen @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ in chickens decreases campylobacteriosis, few effective approaches are available. The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ chicken colonization. Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), or @sm$ ursodeoxycholic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ UDCA @/sm$). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ cecal colonization below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or @sm$ UDCA @/sm$ altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ colonization at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ colonization in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites.	3
Despite the association between @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and IBD, the isolation rates of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from enteric samples are low. Our finding that 0.4% @sm$ sodium fumarate @/sm$ increases the growth of all @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains suggest that it can be used to enhance the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from enteric samples. We also found that 0.4% @sm$ sodium fumarate @/sm$ affected @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ protein expression. Most of the proteins that decreased in expression when @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was cultured on HBAfum0.4 were involved in metabolism and most of the proteins with increased expression were involved in nutrient acquisition (Tables 4, 5, 6). These findings indicate that @sm$ sodium fumarate @/sm$ has increased the growth most likely by affecting energy generation.	2
Diclofenac was the only non-antibiotic to cause induction in more than one bacterial isolate (@gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and B. eggerthii). @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and C. beijerinckii make up more than half of the positive results for non-antibiotic prophage induction. This indicates that specific gut isolates are more susceptible to non-antibiotic medications. Only two non-antibiotics did not lead to prophage induction in our isolates: @sm$ ibuprofen @/sm$ (NSAID) and busulfan (chemotherapy), despite increasing overall VLP counts (3-fold for @sm$ ibuprofen @/sm$, adjusted p-value: 0.384; 3-fold increase for busulfan, adjusted p-value: 0.983; Figure 2B).	3
Dietary treatments were a control (commercial diet with no additive), INU (20 g @sm$ inulin @/sm$/kg diet), CAR (20 g FC/kg diet), and GAR (90 mgPTS-O/kg diet). As a result of this study, @sm$ inulin @/sm$ supplementation resulted in lower (P < 0.05) and FC feeding resulted in higher (P < 0.05) Blautia coccoides/Eubacterium rectale log10 number of copies respect to controls. Higher (P < 0.05) bifidobacteria log10 number of copies with respect to the controls was determined in the ileal mucosa of birds fed the PTS-O-supplemented diet. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and PCR analysis on Bifidobacterium spp. revealed the presence of Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum in samples from chickens fed the control and the PTS-O-supplemented diet. Bifidobacterium longum was exclusively found in poultry fed the control diet, whereas B. pseudocatenulatum was found only in poultry fed the PTS-O-supplemented diet. This study showed that both PTS-O and FC were able to modulate the composition of the ileal mucosa-associated microbiota of growing broiler chickens. Finally, in addition to @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$, the presence of B.	2
Different Lactobacillus strains act via distinct and/or overlapping pathways, such as @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ was found to not only increase bone density by elevating calcium uptake, but also secrete bioactive peptides valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP) and isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (IPP). Further, conversion of insoluble inorganic salts into soluble forms, protection of intestinal mineral absorption sites, triggering of the modulation of calcium-binding proteins, and minimization of the interaction of minerals with @sm$ phytic acids @/sm$ are the main actions reported by different strains of Lactobacillus that supported bone health.	1
Different from the commonly secreted @sm$ adenine @/sm$ and hypoxanthine by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, the dominant secretion of @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ is xanthine (Premasiri et al.), conferring a prominent peak at 654 cm-1. As a consequence, this peak was used as the biomarker of @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$. The signal ratio of the biomarker of tested bacteria was calculated by dividing the peak signal of the antibiotic-treated sample droplet by that of the adjacent non-treated control-sample droplet: , where  and  are the signal strengths of the biomarker peak at  with and without the antibiotic treatment, respectively. For each bacterial-antibiotic combination, four SERS-AST signal ratios corresponding to four different antibiotic concentrations were obtained. The SERS uniformity test with @sm$ adenine @/sm$ (10-4 M) of the AgNP/AAO slide showed that the average standard deviation across the SERS-active area was 15% (Han et al.; Liu et al.).	1
Different microbial genera including Bacteroides, Enterococcus, and Eubacteria play a key role in determining the metabolic fate of @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$. In addition, some @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ bio-transformations require the presence of specific bacteria. For example, gut bacteria involved in resveratrol metabolism are Slackia equolifaciens and @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$. Curcumin is converted into active metabolites mainly by Escherichia coli, but it can also be metabolized by Blautia sp., and quercetin can be converted into active metabolites by specific bacterial strains such as Eubacterium ramulus, Clostridium orbiscindens, Eubacterium oxidoreducens, and Butyrovibrio spp. that can cleave the C-ring. The importance of gut bacteria for @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ metabolism is further indicated by the fact that germ-free animals are not able to produce phenolic metabolites. However, individual differences in gut microbiota composition can account for individual variations in absorption, metabolism, and @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ bioactivity. Thus, the identification of bacterial species responsible for @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ metabolism is crucial to unraveling the health-promoting effects on the host. Individual differences in microbiota compositions can influence the metabolic fate of ingested @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$. This can explain the reason why a similar daily intake of @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ results in different health effects.	2
Disha A (@gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$) and Disha B (Bacillus safensis) were isolated from pesticide-infested agricultural field and showed tolerance against pesticides, heavy metals, and antibiotics. The isolates exhibited PGPR activities in vitro as well as in field conditions in lentil (Lens culinaris) and cow pea (Vigna unguiculata). Both the Bacillus species could not be grown in mineral salt medium but efficiently grown in the media supplemented with pesticide (imidacloprid/carbendazim) demonstrating the utilization of pesticide as carbon/nitrogen source. The HPLC studies exhibited the pesticide (imidacloprid/carbendazim) degradation by both the bacteria. B. safensis showed better degradation of carbendazim (88.93%) and imidacloprid (82.48%) than that of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ 78.07% and 49.12%, respectively. The bacterial isolates showed high concentration of heavy metal tolerance viz. lead, @sm$ molybdenum @/sm$, cadmium, copper, cobalt, and zinc, except mercury. Both the bacteria possessed single plasmid. The plasmid-cured isolates of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ did not tolerate any pesticide, whereas that of B. safensis tolerated all the pesticides, like wild strains. The plasmid curing experiments did not affect the heavy metal tolerance ability of both the bacteria indicating the genomic nature of heavy metal tolerance genes, whereas pesticide resistance genes are plasmid-dependent in @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ but genomic in B.	4
Dps protects cells from oxidative damage through binding genomic DNA and by sequestering free Fe2+ and @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$ that could otherwise react in Fenton reactions, resulting in OH  formation. MsrAB reduces methionine sulfoxide (resulting from the oxidation of methionine) back to methionine and thereby scavenges ROS. Strains of 27% of the studied species were found to lack a homolog of Dps (Fig. 1), including highly O2-sensitive strains of B. adolescentis and B. angulatum as well as relatively O2-tolerant strains of @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ (Table S3).	3
Due to anthropogenic activities, the mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, @sm$ Cu @/sm$, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the Baiyangdian area exceeded the environmental background values by varying degrees (Gao et al., ; Zhang et al., ). The concentration of @sm$ copper @/sm$ in the Baiyangdian area ranged from about 0.15-0.7 mM and the background of this area was 0.34 mM (Zhang et al., ). Though the living environment was quite different between the natural habitat and laboratory culture, it was reasonable to hypothesize that the @sm$ copper @/sm$ resistance of strain ZSY-33 was consistent with the environment. Compared with Cupriavidus gilardii CR3 (Huang et al., ), Bacillus cereus strain T6 (Wu et al., ), and @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (Yan et al., ), the @sm$ copper @/sm$ tolerance of strain ZSY-33 was slightly lower. The MIC of ZSY-33 was similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.6 mM) and Providencia rettgeriand (1.8 mM) (Hassen et al., ), and much higher than that of E. coli K12 (0.5 mM) (Hassen et al., ). The @sm$ copper @/sm$ toxicity of P. spadix (EC50 = 0.5625 mM) was much lower than that determined in Bacillus altitudinis (EC50 = 5.56 mM) (Khan et al., ). Noteworthy, the @sm$ copper @/sm$ resistance of strain ZSY-33 was affected by the culture condition. In the LB medium, the MIC of @sm$ copper @/sm$ was 1.8 mM Cu2+, which was much higher than that in the basic medium (Figure 2 and Figure S2).	4
Due to their excellent properties, @sm$ CuO @/sm$ NPs have attracted great interest from the healthcare, food packaging, medical, and environmental industries. This metal oxide is capable of disrupting the normal function of the cell membrane, changing its permeability and the cellular respiration process. Matsuda et al. (2019) have developed a fluoride-containing ZnO-@sm$ CuO @/sm$ nanocomposite which inhibited the bacterial growth of Streptococcus mutans, showing a potential use in dental materials. @sm$ CuO @/sm$ nanorods (110 nm in length and 10 nm in diameter) were obtained by the precipitation process. The antimicrobial studies revealed good antimicrobial activity against E. coli, @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$, and S.	3
Due to their prebiotic potential indigestible @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ became a major focus of research interest. In this study the growth of selected probiotic strains including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, Pediococcus ssp. and Enterococcus faecium with the, raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) raffinose, stachyose and verbascose and galactomannan from guar bean Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (total guar carbohydrates, @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ (dp 2-4) and polysaccharides (dp > 5), obtained by size exclusion chromatography) were tested by means of turbidity measurements. RFOs were used by 75% of all strains, with some delay for the trisaccharide raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose and a limited fermentation of the pentasaccharide verbascose. L. reuteri, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ and B. lactis HNO19  were able to ferment not only raffinose and stachyose but also verbascose. Guar @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ were fermented by 15 out of 20 strains; P. acidilactici, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus GG and B. animalis ssp. lactis BB12 metabolized them comparably well as glucose or galactose. Isolated guar polysaccharides were not fermented whereas total guar carbohydrates were fermented by 7 strains, apparently caused by the @sm$ oligosaccharide @/sm$ content. The findings of this study may be important for functional food products especially for indigestible @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ which may cause adverse effects in the gut when not cleaved.	2
During our STL-IMMUNE study, spaceflight also downregulated @sm$ retinoic acid @/sm$-responsive genes in uninfected HT-29 cells, including those encoding mechanosensitive small proline-rich repeat proteins (SPRR) and those involved in type I interferon signaling/antiviral defense. @sm$ Retinoic acid @/sm$, an active metabolite of Vitamin A, regulates cell growth and differentiation and can modulate immune responses in either a protective or pathogenic capacity depending on its concentration. During infection, retinoids facilitate epithelial barrier repair and are important immunomodulators in the intestine. Vitamin A deficiency tends to increase susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection and alternatively, infection can lead to its depletion. The administration of @sm$ retinoic acid @/sm$ has been shown to decrease the severity of @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$-mediated gastroenteritis in mice.	3
During the analysis of the gallbladders, seven specimens of the family Rhytidodidae [three specimens of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ and four specimens of R. similis were found in the first host and only eight R. similis were found in the second host]. The parasites were fixed in 70% @sm$ alcohol @/sm$, stained with hydrochloric carmine and cleared in a eugenol solution. The specimens were photographed and measured (data expressed as minimum-maximum values in mum) under a microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Kurobane Nikon Co., Ltd., Otawara, Tochigi, Japan) with the aid of the NIS-Elements BR software. Analyses of the parasites were authorized by federal licenses for activities with scientific purposes (SISBIO 30600-1 and 9329-1). The helminths were deposited in the Helminthological Collection of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (R. similis = CHIOC 38590; @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ = CHIOC 38589) in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	0
During the investigated course of incubation durations, Lactobacillus rhamnosus TMU094 bound 25.64 to 75.06%, Lactobacillus fermentum bound 38.63 to 72.15%, @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ bound 24.86 to 63.21%, and L. rhamnosus PTCC1637 bound 19.41 to 35% of AFB1. These findings demonstrated the capability of native LAB strains to bind AFB1 efficiently. According to toxicity research conducted on HeLa cells, the newly synthesized chemicals are less hazardous than @sm$ AFB1 @/sm$.	2
During the last year in our oncology unit adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 3 patients with breast (n=1) and stomach cancer (n=2) and febrile neutropenia was seen after the first course of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, @sm$ 5-fluorouracil @/sm$, etoposide, Adriamycin, and cisplatin) in all 3 patients. Cefepime and amikacin were commenced but the fever continued. Prior to antifungal treatment, the patients were re-evaluated because of the history of unpasteurized milk ingestion without overt signs and symptoms. Serum agglutination tests of brucellosis were performed and were 1:640 in two patients and 1:320 in the third. @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ was identified only in one case although multiple blood cultures were taken from all 3 patients.	3
During the study directed to the evaluation of antitubercular property of calanolides and their semisynthetic analogues, the pharmacokinetic data indicated that the @sm$ (+)-calanolide A @/sm$ (1) concentrations in plasma could be comparable to the observed in vitro MICs against @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$.	3
During the three day period in which probiotics are consumed, the population of Bifidobacterium increases as expected, while the populations of Clostridium and @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ decrease. These populations decline due to the increased competition for the nutrients glucose, inulin, @sm$ lactose @/sm$ and fructooligosaccharide, all of which are also consumed by bifidobacteria.	2
Dysgonomonas had a significant negative correlation with filter paper enzyme activity, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ had a significant negative correlation with xylanase activity, and Pseudomonas and Enterobacter had a significant positive correlation with laccase and lignin peroxidase activity. Rhizobium and Proteiniphilum were positively correlated with acetic acid, prophetic acid, and @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$ contents.	1
EC_25922 culture was centrifuged, washed and diluted by @sm$ PBS @/sm$ and coated on the LB agar plate. An Oxford cup (inner diameter 8.0 mm) was placed on a plate. Acellular supernatant (200 microL) of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ was added to the Oxford Cup and cultured at 37  C for 48 h.	3
"EPA's Maximum Containment Level goal for drinking @sm$ water @/sm$ is zero organisms, and @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ is specifically listed as a contaminant needing control. EPA states that as long as proper treatment technique is used for removal of Giardia and viruses, then @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ should by default also be controlled. It released ""@gm$ Legionella @/gm$: Human Health Criteria Document"" in 1999, in which it described the microbiologic features, distribution, and health effects of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ in the United States and references Allegheny County's (Pennsylvania) recommendations for routine environmental testing (described later)."	3
EPs (compared with non-EPs) had higher abundances of @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ and Coprococcus catus but lower abundances of Ruminococcus gnavus (false discovery rate <0.05). Among the 7 determined fecal acylcarnitine metabolites, @sm$ palmitoylcarnitine @/sm$, oleylcarnitine 18:1, and stearylcarnitine were inversely associated with EPs but positively correlated with obesity conditions and progression.	0
Each group was given the following different treatments: Control (CON) group; goats fed a basal diet, and the @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ (@gm$ CB @/gm$) group; goats fed a basal diet supplemented with 2x108 CFU/kg @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ (@gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ was provided by Hubei Lvxue Biological Industry Co., LTD, China) for 15 to 71 d. The composition and nutrient levels of diets are shown in  Table 1 . @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ was administered directly to the goat's mouth at the daily morning feeding to ensure its total intake. Goats were allowed to drink fresh water freely. Before the trial, all goats were dewormed with @sm$ albendazole @/sm$ at 10.8 mg/kg of their living body weight.	4
Early research focused on endogenous acrylic acid producers, such as the obligate anaerobes Clostridium propionicum and @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ that are capable of reducing lactic acid to propionic acid via an @sm$ acrylyl-CoA @/sm$ intermediate.	1
Early studies have established the roles of gut microbiota in supporting the CpG-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and the anti-tumor immune responses to @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$ (CTX) chemotherapy. Following research further identified multiple microbiota taxa in enhancing immunomodulatory therapies and controlling tumor-killing efficacy of cytotoxic T cells. @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ promotes anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy by enhancing CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment.	0
Eggerthella lenta, Asaccharobacter celatus, @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, and Slackia equolifaciens belong to the Eggerthellaceae and strains of these species have been shown to play a role in the transformation of bioactive secondary plant compounds such as daidzein from soy, or trans-resveratrol from grape vine. For example, daidzein was shown to be transformed into dihydrodaidzein and equol by S. isoflavoni-covertans HE8 and the genes involved were cloned and sequenced. Equol has a higher binding affinity to human estrogen receptors alpha and beta than daidzein (10-80 times) and induces transcription more strongly than any other @sm$ isoflavone @/sm$. showed that E. lenta, @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, and S.	1
Eight species of bifidobacteria were tested for their abilities to grow on a range of monosaccharides (glucose, arabinose, xylose, @sm$ galactose @/sm$ and mannose). In contrast to the other sugars, glucose and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ were utilized by all species and, in general, specific growth rates were highest on these sugars. Different substrate preferences were observed between species when the bacteria were grown in the presence of all five monosaccharides. For example, glucose and xylose were coutilized by Bifidobacterium longum, whereas glucose repressed uptake of all other sugars in B. bifidum and B. catenulatum. @sm$ Galactose @/sm$ was the preferred substrate with B. pseudolongum. In @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, glucose and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ were utilized simultaneously.	2
Elevated levels of @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ have been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Accelerated atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice has been demonstrated in a mouse model study of dietary supplementation with @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ or its precursors. By measuring @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ levels in plasma from healthy individuals and patients with cardiovascular disease, it was found to be 4.04 muM in patients with cardiovascular disease, whereas plasma levels of @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ were as low as 3.21 muM in healthy individuals. Furthermore, a high @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ level is considered an indicator of an increased disease risk in the future. This association has been supported by numerous experimental and clinical data, which have also shown that @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models. For example, C57BL/6 J, Apo-/- mice were fed regular chow versus the same chow supplemented with L-carnitine, respectively, from the time of weaning. In contrast, Apoe-/- mice had an approximately doubled atherosclerotic burden and elevated plasma levels of TMA and @sm$ TMAO @/sm$. And another study showed by 16S rRNA sequencing that Apoe-/- mice fed a high choline diet had a 44.2% higher burden of atherosclerosis than mice with @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$. Several reviews in recent years have also emphasized the clinical relevance of the @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ pathway in cardiovascular disease, highlighting its potential as a treatment target. Several studies have demonstrated a clear association between intestinal flora and cardiovascular disease, providing valuable insights for further exploration of the potential of the @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ pathway in the prevention and treatment of CVD.	0
Elevated levels of trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO) and its precursor @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ (@sm$ TMA @/sm$) were found in PE patients, which could induce spiral arterial remodeling defects by increasing sFlt-1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the placenta. As methanogenic archaea, Methanobrevibacter can convert @sm$ TMA @/sm$ to methane and thereby reduce the risk of PE. In addition, we also found that @gm$ Eubacterium (ventriosum @/gm$ group), Enterorhabdus, and Tyzzerella 3 were associated with PE. @gm$ Eubacterium (ventriosum @/gm$ group) can increase the level of SCFA and thus decrease visceral fat accumulation; furthermore, some other species of Eubacterium, such as E.	2
Empiric treatment with levofloxacin, doxycycline, and azithromycin was initiated for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, and the previously prescribed @sm$ prednisone @/sm$ was rapidly tapered and stopped. At CDC, immunohistochemical testing of tissue for mycobacteria showed extensive bacilli. DNA extracted from biopsy samples was evaluated by PCR targeting 16s rRNA and the IS2402 insertion element. Sequences of IS2404 amplicons were 100% identical with those for @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$. Tissue cultured (30 C) at CDC grew AFB after 3 months (toe specimen) and 4 months (calf specimen); 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed a Mycobacterium species, most closely matching M. marinum or @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$.	0
Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) Miller broth and on LB Miller agar, while @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ strains were grown in brain heart infusion broth (BHIB) or on Columbia blood agar (Oxoid). The growth of Escherichia coli and @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ strains was typically carried out at 37 C. Ampicillin (50 microg/ml), nalidixic acid (50 microg/ml), @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ (50 microg/ml), gentamycin (25 microg/ml), streptomycin (50 microg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 microg/ml) were added when necessary (Table 2).	3
Establishing the antibiotic sensitivity of the avian respiratory pathogen @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ is difficult because of the organism's complex growth requirements and the unusually frequent occurrence of resistance. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 antibiotics were determined for 45 strains of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ from Belgian broiler chickens collected from 45 farms between 1995 and 1998. They were compared with the type strain, which was isolated from a turkey, and a strain isolated from a rook. All the broiler strains were resistant to lincomycin and to the beta-lactams @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$ and ceftiofur.	4
Evaluation of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ intra-macrophage survival assay robustness was assessed by calculating the Z' values from 10 plates (1,536-well plate format) in independent runs of assay using only dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.5% vol/vol) as a negative control (no effect on @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ growth) and @sm$ moxifloxacin @/sm$ (20 microM) as a macrophage permeable positive control (at 20 microM @sm$ moxifloxacin @/sm$, there was no detectable bacterial survival). @sm$ Moxifloxacin @/sm$ and DMSO were used as controls on each plate in the HTS to monitor assay quality through determination of Z' as well as for normalizing the data on a per-plate basis (see Data analysis in Materials and Methods).	3
Except C23O encoded by mhpB gene, DHPAO encoded by mhpB2 gene in this study might be highly possible involved in the degradation of @sm$ catechol @/sm$ which was an important degradation intermediate of phenol. Gene mhpB was found in the phenol degradation cluster (TPY_0628-0634), while mhpB2 (TPY_2461) was flanked by hpaB (TPY_2462) and hpaC (TPY_2460). Therefore, mhpB2 encoding DHPAO, and hpaB and hpaC encoding two components of 4-HPA 3-hydroxylase from S. acidophilus TPY were cloned and expressed in @gm$ E. coli @/gm$, and the corresponding enzymes were purified and characterized.	1
Excluding simple sugars, fastest growth was achieved on @sm$ dextran @/sm$ (0.099+-0.048 OD600 units/h), laminarin (0.095+-0.014), pectic galactan (0.088+-0.018), pullulan (0.088+-0.026), and amylopectin (0.085+-0.003). Although one study has reported that the type strain of @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ degrades cellulose, the WH2 strain failed to demonstrate any growth on MM plus cellulose (specifically, Solka-Floc 200 FCC from International Fiber Corp.) after 5 d. Maximum cell density was achieved with amylopectin (1.17+-0.02 OD600 units), @sm$ dextran @/sm$ (1.12+-0.20), cellobiose (1.09+-0.08), laminarin (1.08+-0.08), and xyloglucan (0.99+-0.04).	2
Extracellular fatty acid incorporation into the @sm$ phospholipids @/sm$ of @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ occurs via fatty acid phosphorylation. We show that fatty acid kinase (Fak) is composed of two dissociable protein subunits encoded by separate genes. FakA provides the ATP binding domain and interacts with two distinct FakB proteins to produce acyl-phosphate. The FakBs are fatty acid binding proteins that exchange bound fatty acid/acyl-phosphate with fatty acid/acyl-phosphate presented in detergent micelles or liposomes. The DeltafakA and DeltafakB1 DeltafakB2 strains were unable to incorporate extracellular fatty acids into @sm$ phospholipid @/sm$.	1
FadA encodes the key enzyme acetyl-CoA acyltransferase participating in beta-oxidation that affects @sm$ alpha-linolenic acid @/sm$ metabolism, fatty acid degradation and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation. Short chain hydroxy fatty acids, such as lactic acid and 2,3-dihydroxyvaleric acid, were negatively correlated with the dMMR-enriched species @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, Collinsella aerofaciens, B.	0
Faecal calprotectin levels were measured in the faecal samples from the washout, @sm$ maltodextrin @/sm$ and AXOS supplementation periods and there were no differences between the three periods across all the volunteers (p = 0.448). There were no significant differences in calprotectin levels between the AXOS and @sm$ maltodextrin @/sm$ periods, or between the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$-plus/minus groups of volunteers.	0
Fermentable nondigestible carbohydrate, such as nonstarch @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, oligosaccharides, lignin, and analogous @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, are involved in the production of SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, through the action of gut microbiota. SCFAs are pivotal in the regulation of the synthesis of gastrointestinal hormones such as ghrelin and leptin from enteroendocrine cells. Anaerostipes spp., Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus comes, Coprococcus eutactus, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, Roseburia spp., and Ruminococcus bromii are involved in the synthesis of butyrate. Bacteroides spp., @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Dialister spp., Salmonella spp., Megasphaera elsdenii, Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus obeum, and Veillonella spp.	1
Fifteen of the isolates were belonging to the @gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ subspecies (@gm$ S. bovis biotype II.2 @/gm$), while one isolate was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (S. bovis biotype I). Thirteen of the total sixteen isolates were sensitive to penicillin, while two showed intermediate sensitivity and one isolate was resistant to penicillin (Fig. 1). Ampicillin resistance was seen in only one of the isolates, while all the isolates were uniformly sensitive to @sm$ ceftriaxone @/sm$.	3
"Fifty percent of nursing homes used bleach to clean, 40% used quaternary ammonium, and 10% used another product (@sm$ tri-sodium phosphate @/sm$, marketed as ""Spic n Span""). For residents with C.difficile infection, bleach was used for routine and discharge cleaning in 90% of nursing homes, and for discharge cleaning only in 10%. For residents with MRSA, other multi-drug resistant pathogens, or @gm$ C.difficile @/gm$, rooms were cleaned last each day in 50% of nursing homes."	3
Figure 2E-F shows the results of the two tetracycline antibiotics tested for efficacy against @gm$ Mkn @/gm$. On day 7 of the study, compared to the non-treated controls, the Emax of minocycline was recorded as 4.96 log10 CFU/mL and the EC50 was calculated as 1.21 mg/L (Figure 2E). The second tetracycline, omadacycline (Figure 2F) showed an Emax of 2.81 log10 CFU/mL on day 7 of the study with an EC50 of 0.04 mg/L (the lowest EC50 of any single drug tested excepting @sm$ bedaquiline @/sm$, as shown below).	3
Figure 3B demonstrated the @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ denitrification efficiency kept increasing as with the improving of dosage of carbon source (C/N) among a certain C/N ratio range, which was consistent with the conclusion drawn from the nitrate denitrification of Psychrobacter sp. S1-1 and Marinobacter sp. F6, and ammonium removal of heterotrophic nitrifying-aerobic denitrifying bacteria including @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ YB, Pseudomonas putida YH, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa YL.	2
Finally, in the present study, significantly lower levels of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were not observed in the PH-G than in the Non-PH-G; in fact, they tended to be higher than in the non-PH-G (p=0.063). In previous reports, it has been reported that the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus reduces liver cirrhosis. However, it should be noted that in recent years, the levels of the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus have been reported to increase with both alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. This is attributed to the fact that some species in the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus has an acetaldehyde cumulative effect. East Asian people have a genetic variation in alcohol metabolism involving frequently increased acetaldehyde levels after @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ consumption, and they characteristically have a poor physiological reaction to alcohol. @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$ is one species of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ found to be associated with liver cirrhosis; this species has been found to be able to produce large amounts of gamma-aminobutyric acid, an important neurotransmitter. Based on these facts, it is also possible that there is compensatory feedback of the microbiota to changes in the metabolism of serotonin and other neural mediators in cases of alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The present study showed that 50% of the PH-G had alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and the levels of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were significantly higher in the ALC group than in the Non-ALC group. Therefore, it is possible that the gut microbiota in the ALC group reflected an increase in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus levels associated with alcohol metabolism.	1
Finally, single isolates of @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ phage type (PT) Dundee and S. Typhimurium PT193:both positive for blaOXA-48:were recovered in 2013 from hospitalized patients with diarrhea in the United Kingdom. The first patient reported a history of travel to Africa, but the second did not recount recent travels. The @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ and S. Typhimurium isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to ertapenem and @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$, and were susceptible to meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime.	3
Finally, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (300 muL) and 99% @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ (300 muL) and stored at -20  C until analysis. Then, bacterial populations were enumerated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using oligonucleotide probes targeting specific regions of 16S rRNA. Probes were commercially synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy3. The following probes were used: Bif164 for Bifidobacterium spp.; Lab158 for Lactobacillus/Enterococcus; Erec482 for Eubacterium rectale-@gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ group (@gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ cluster XIVa); Bac303 for Bacteroides-Prevotella group; and EUB 338 mixture consisting of EUB338, EUB338II, and EUB338III for total bacteria.	0
Finally, the functionally annotated gene most similar to the candidate DOPAC dehydroxylase is Cldh (45% amino acid ID), a @gm$ Gordonibacter @/gm$ enzyme recently implicated in the dehydroxylation of the lignan dmSECO (Supplementary file 2c). Though this functional assignment awaits biochemical confirmation, we propose that the highest upregulated enzyme across our two independent datasets is the DOPAC dehydroxylase. Interestingly, unlike with the Eggerthella dehydroxylases, tungstate did not inhibit dehydroxylation of DOPAC by @gm$ G. pamelaeae @/gm$ (Figure 4:figure supplement 3). This may be explained if the dehydroxylating enzyme can use both @sm$ molybdenum @/sm$ and tungsten for catalysis, as is seen in certain closely related enzymes.	4
Finally, two @gm$ Sphingobacterium faecium @/gm$ isolates were selected based on this species' aforementioned role in harboring feedlot-specific macrolide resistance to @sm$ tylosin @/sm$, tilmicosin, and tildipirosin.	4
Finally, whether meat or meal digestion, the presence of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ CM454 modified the percentage of ferrous ion, which meant a more reducing medium, possibly due to oxygen consumption by the bacteria. It could also be attributed to the role of ascorbate as an electron donor, as, in the presence of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ CM454, ascorbate was oxidized (@sm$ DHA @/sm$).	2
Finding new bacteria from highly specific environmental niches that possess enhanced @sm$ alkane @/sm$ production capabilities is another strategic focus. Exploration of new niches could be used in the search for better hosts or in the identification of more powerful enzymes that are more active or that have different substrates specificities. For example, rumen microbiota has been recently explored as a source of possible consolidated bioprocesses. Because this environment is rich in cellulolytic microorganisms, it would be expected to harbour microorganisms capable of directly transforming vegetal fibres into biofuels. In addition, an innovative, thermodynamics-based approach to isolate new @sm$ alkane @/sm$-producing microorganisms has been recently explored by Kohn and Kim (2015). The authors hypothesized that, because many fermentation systems are close to thermodynamic equilibrium, when the systems are perturbed, by, for example changing the concentrations of substrates, the system readjusts in order to restore the equilibrium. According to this principle, they isolated microorganisms able to degrade @sm$ alkanes @/sm$ in favourable conditions. Once theses microbial platforms were established, the authors altered fermentation conditions by changing the proportions of H2 and CO2 to make the reverse reactions thermodynamically optimal. Based on this principle the authors found 46 different isolates that were able to produce C3 to C8 hydrocarbons, including 1-hexane directly from H2 and CO2. Of the isolates able to produce @sm$ alkanes @/sm$, they identified species of Actinomyces sp., @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$, E. hirae, E. coli, Clostridium glycolicum, Proteus sp. and Tissirella sp. Further studies are required to confirm whether these strains are @sm$ alkane @/sm$ producers and to define their metabolic pathways in order to identify useful enzymatic functions and to glean vital information for the improvement of existing recombinant strains.	1
First, in vitro experiments allowed the classification of bacterial growth and fermentation profiles in response to various @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources, including agave inulin, corn fiber, polydextrose, and citrus pectin. The influence of phylogenetic affiliation appeared to statistically outweigh @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources in determining the degree of carbohydrate utilization. Second, we narrowed our focus on six commensal bacteria representative of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla to perform an untargeted high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis: @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides intestinalis, Subdoligranulum variabile, Roseburia intestinalis, and Eubacterium rectale exhibited distinct metabolomic profiles in response to different @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources. The relative abundance of bacterial metabolites was significantly influenced by dietary carbohydrates, with these effects being strain-specific and/or carbohydrate-specific. Particularly, the findings indicated an elevation in short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites, including succinate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and nicotinic acid. These metabolites were associated with putative health benefits. Finally, an RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach provided deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolization. Restricting our focus on four commensal bacteria, including @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, B. thetaiotaomicron, S. variabile, and R. intestinalis, @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources did significantly modulate the level of bacterial genes related to the enzymatic machinery involved in the metabolization of dietary carbohydrates.	2
First-pass pulmonary uptake of @sm$ 51-chromium @/sm$-labeled, killed @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ bacteria was studied in 26 pigs. In 16 controls, four injections at hourly intervals revealed an initial uptake of 84.5% +/- 1.5 (Mean +/- S.E.M.) and a 95% first-pass uptake of 78.6% +/- 2.4, and no significant change with time. In the ten traumatized animals only the values at 5 hours were significantly lower than the controls. It is concluded that repeated injections of killed @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ bacteria without trauma do not interfere with the ability of the lung to remove these bacteria during their first passage through the lung, but that with trauma to the leg do to a slight degree.	4
Five faecal isolates from diarrheic patients were selected for the study (@gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates 2010-1718, 2009-75775, 2009-118452, 2009-119100, and 2012-197540 as previously published) as well as the oral reference strain @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 33237 @/gm$). Isolates were cultured on 5% horse blood agar, containing 1% yeast extract (SSI Diagnostica, Hillerod, Denmark), and incubated at 37 C in a microaerobic atmosphere with 3% @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$.	3
Five heavy metal-immobilizing bacteria, Enterobacter bugandensis CQ-7, Bacillus megaterium CQ-30, Bacillus thuringensis CQ-33, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ CQ-169, and Serratia nematodiphila JZ-262, which showed high production of @sm$ IAA @/sm$ and siderophores and high resistance to Cd and Pb were used to study their effects on the growth and enrichment of Cd and Pb in water spinach.	1
Five lactic acid-producing strains were tested:Lactobacillus casei, @gm$ Lactobacillus delbrueckii @/gm$, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus coagulans, and Bacillus smithii. While in the presence of alkaline treatment by-products, L. caseis was least affected (depending on the inhibitor's concentration), in the case of acid treatment:only growth of L. casei and L. lactis was not fully inhibited. The synergy between formic acid, @sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, and coumaric acid was found as a key inhibitory parameter in alkaline pretreated lignocellulose, while in the case of acid pretreated lignocellulose, furfural was the major inhibitor. investigated the influence of an inhibitory cocktail (@sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, HMF, furfural, and p-coumaric acid) on the growth of four Saccharomyces cerevisiae and four Lactobacillus paracasei strains.	3
Five proteins had a higher abundance in the high-salt diet group than those in the LSD group (Supplementary Table S3), including cytidylate kinase, trigger factor, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transporter, and undecaprenyl-diphosphatase, which were secreted by different gut bacteria, including Atopobium parvulum, @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, Lactobacillus brevis, Anaerostipes hadrus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Cytidylate kinase is involved in @sm$ pyrimidine @/sm$ metabolism, ATP binding, transferase, and cytidylate kinase activity.	1
Five strain @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ or L. monocytogenes cocktails were separately inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion broth containing 0.5% (w/v) aqueous oriental mustard extract and incubated at 4  C to 21  C for 21 d. For inhibitor combination tests, Salmonella Typhimurium 02:8423 and L. monocytogenes 2-243 were individually inoculated in Mueller Hinton broth containing the mustard extract with either or both 0.2% (w/v) malic acid and 0.2% (w/v) EDTA and incubated at 10  C or 21  C for 10 to 14 d. Mustard extract inhibited growth of the L. monocytogenes cocktail at 4  C up to 21 d (2.3 log10 CFU/mL inhibition) or at 10  C for 7 d (2.4 log10 CFU/mL inhibition). Salmonella spp. viability was slightly, but significantly reduced by mustard extract at 4  C by 21 d. Although hydrolysis of sinigrin in mustard extract by both pathogens was 2 to 6 times higher at 21  C than at 4  C to 10  C, mustard was not inhibitory at 21  C, perhaps because of the instability of its hydrolysis product (@sm$ allyl isothiocyanate @/sm$). At 21  C, additive inhibitory effects of mustard extract with EDTA or malic acid led to undetectable levels of @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ and L. monocytogenes by 7 d and 10 d, respectively. At 10  C, @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ was similarly susceptible, but combinations of antimicrobials were not more inhibitory to L.	3
Flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, andmyricetin) are the flavonoids that have a @sm$ 3-hydroxyflavone @/sm$ framework. These flavonoids are broken down by gut bacteria to produce simpler metabolites after C-ring cleavage. Gut microbes involved in these transformations include Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides ovatus, @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Bacteroides uniformis.	1
Following the discovery of 1 as a biofilm inhibitor for @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ we examined 12 endogenous human bile acid derivatives (1-12), as well as other components of bile including intact ox bile, fatty acids, bilirubin, and phosphocholine, and cholesterol for biofilm inhibition in both the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ and P. aeruginosa assay systems (Fig 1, S4 Table). Both pathogens are exposed to bile during infection, and it is known that @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ utilizes intestinal bile as an in vivo signal to induce virulence factor production. By contrast, P. aeruginosa encounters bile acids via aspiration of gastro esophageal reflux. In addition to @sm$ TCA @/sm$ (1), there are 11 other bile acids that are commonly encountered in the human digestive system (Fig 1).	3
For example, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ in the intestine convert Trp into ILA and IAA. Krishnan et al. and Ehrlich et al. reported that IAA and ILA attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression via the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Unexpectedly, Trp-derived @sm$ indole @/sm$ is transferred into the liver and further converted to IS by cytochrome P450 2E1 and sulfotransferases.	1
For example, D-pinitol and sucrose correlated with at least one among Actinomyces, Sphingomonas, Rothia, and @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$; 1-hexadecanol, 1-pentadecanol and deoxycholic acid correlated with at least one Clostridiales mamber, such as Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium hallii group, Family XIII AD3011 group, Anaerostipes, Fusicatenibacter, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus sp. 5139BFAA; D-arabinose correlated with Aspergillus; aminomalonic acid and l-tryptophan correlated with Aspergillus rugulosus; inosine correlated with Aspergillus tritici and Penicillium sp.; and beta-sitosterol correlated with Penicillium citrinum (Fig. 5 A and B). In particular, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol highly and positively correlated with an unclassified species of Didymellaceae (r = 0.73, p = 3.47E-07) (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, some COVID-19-depleted/enriched metabolites and bacteria or fungi were negatively correlated. For example, 1-hexadecanol, 1-pentadecanol and deoxycholic acid correlated with at least one among Actinomyces, Sphingomonas, Rothia, Actinomyces odontolyticus and @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$; 1,5-anhydroglucitol correlated with Aspergillus and Aspergillus penicillioide; and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol correlated with Aspergillus sp.; and @sm$ oxalic acid @/sm$ correlated with Aspergillus (Fig.	0
For example, Roseburia intestinalis excretes hydrogen, which is a nutrient for @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ that, in return, produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$, an important substrate for R.	1
For example, adding conductive materials such as graphene, granular activated carbon (GAC), biochar, zero-valent metals, or @sm$ hematite @/sm$ to the anaerobic digesters can promote DIET among methanogens (mostly Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, Methanoregula, Methanobacterium, Methanospirillum, and Methanolinea) and exoelectrogenic bacteria such as Geobacter, Smithella, Thauera, and Syntrophomonas. In addition, some species of Bacteroides and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ may participate in DIET.	0
For example, daily LAC intake for 6 months significantly decreases @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ abundance and body weight and improves the lipid metabolism in obese children, thereby elevating HDL level; these phenomena suggest that increased LAC and decreased @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ abundance levels alleviate the risk factors of atherosclerosis. In the present study, the gut microflora in mice at the time of weaning were composed of Enterobacteriaceae, LAC, Helicobacteraceae, and BAC. Aberrant changes in gut microflora, which were characterized by decreased LAC abundance and increased DSV abundance with age in the feces of mice, were aggravated by BFS. According to previous research, LAC supplementation can improve food digestibility, regulate lipid metabolism, reduce serum @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ concentration, and prevent LDL oxidation.	2
For example, farnesoid X receptor agonist fexaramine-induced @sm$ lithocholic acid @/sm$-producing bacteria Acetatifactor and @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ impact liver bile acid synthesis, which in turn can enhance the expression of intestinal farnesoid X receptor targeted genes.	1
For example, hospital wastewater treatment plants in China were shown to contain KPC-2-producing @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$, which is an aquatic Gram-negative organism with emerging importance in hospital infections associated with invasive procedures. According to a Swiss study in 2019, the environmental Gram-negative organism Zhongshania aliphaticivorans, which lives in marine sediments, was shown to produce ZHO-1. This is an intrinsic carbapenemase with significant hydrolytic activity against most beta-lactams including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, with the exception of aztreonam and cefepime. Another Swiss study, also in 2019, recognized the environmental Gram-negative species Pseudobacteriovorax antillogorgiicola to harbor PAN-1, which is an MBL with hydrolytic activity toward most beta-lactams including carbapenems but not cefepime and aztreonam. Results from the last two studies further add to the knowledge that environmental species are a reservoir of possible clinically relevant MBLs. Xin et al. reported pollution of estuarine water with bacterial genera including Rheinheimera, Stenotrophomonas, Shewanella, @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$, Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Algoriphagus, Bowmanella, and Thalassospira, which all harbor blaOXA-58 conferring resistance to carbapenems and penicillin and an ability to hydrolyze cefpirome and cephalothin but not ceftazidime, @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$, or cefepime.	4
For example, we observed reduced gene expression of @gm$ P. copri @/gm$-affiliated CAZymes potentially involved in the conversion of plant polysaccharides (including @sm$ cellulose @/sm$, hemicellulose, beta-glucans, beta-mannan, pectin, and starch) in mice that switched to either of the fiber-reduced diets (Figure 3), in parallel with the reduced abundance of @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ in these mice (Figure 2A) and consistent with studies showing that Prevotella abundance is associated with fiber intake in humans.	2
For gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), specific taxonomic classes based on a systematic study revealed Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes to be positively related while Bifidobacterium and @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ (butyrate producing) are negatively associated with GDM. The negative correlations mean glucose intolerance, inflammation and adiposity GDM women (Chu et al.). Another inconsistency could be the close similarity between gout metagenomes to autoimmune instead of metabolic diseases like T2D. Despite systemic inflammation and @sm$ urate @/sm$ degradation as presumptive non-invasive diagnostic markers induced by dysbiosis, T2D-like dysbiosis is not similar to arthritis diseases like gout (Kunasegaran et al.).	1
For instance, some @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ species were reported to participate in the transition of several organics, such as fermentative metabolism where carbohydrate serves as substrates for growth, and the degradation of @sm$ cellulose @/sm$, starch, or xylan. The species Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum of Butyricicoccus with the ability to produce butyrate with probiotic potential to mitigate gut dysbiosis was applied to pharmabiotics for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, it is convinced that several strains of Bifidobacterium exert a range of beneficial effects within the human gastrointestinal tract, such as promoting the anti-inflammatory response, restraining the growth of pathogenic organisms, and resisting intestinal acid and bile. Some specific Bifidobacterium strains have already been encapsulated for probiotic treatment of patients with IBS, and turned out a prominent efficacy. Consequently, dysbiosis may affect the probiotic function of key genera such as @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Butyricicoccus, and Bifidobacterium, which are believed necessary for mammalian health.	2
For instance, species belonging to Roseburia and Ruminococcus, which are involved in the digestion of plant @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, increased after the short-term vegetarian diet. These have previously been shown to decrease after a short-term meat-rich diet. Accordingly, several species belonging to the bile-tolerant @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, which has previously been associated with a meat-rich diet, showed a lower abundance after the short-term vegetarian diet.	2
For instance, the addition of O-linked (or removal of N-linked) acetyl groups to the peptidoglycan residues @sm$ GlcNAc @/sm$ and MurNAc was shown to confer resistance to lysozyme and reduce the activation of the host immune response (Davis and Weiser,). The deacetylation of @sm$ GlcNAc @/sm$ and/or MurNAc is catalyzed by a deacetylase present in species containing N-deacetylated peptidoglycan (Vollmer,). A significant proportion of the @sm$ GlcNAc @/sm$ residues in the @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ peptidoglycan was shown to be deacetylated, in a process exclusively dependent on the expression of PgdA (Boneca et al.,). In the absence of PgdA, @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ is highly vulnerable to peptidoglycan hydrolases and cell wall-targeting antibiotics, dying rapidly inside macrophages and exhibiting attenuated virulence in the mouse model.	4
For screening for antibacterial activity, the culture broth (CB), cell free supernatant (CFS), and biomass suspension (BS) were used in an antagonistic assay, with @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ S01P2 and V. parahaemolyticus 20130629002S01 as the indicator bacteria. The CFS was further processed as follows: 1 g/ml Tripsin was added to deproteinated supernatant (CFT). The supernatant was heated to 80 C for 10 min to remove @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$ (CFH), then the pH was adjusted to 6.0 to exclude the antimicrobial effect of organic acids (CF6.0).	3
For standard @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ T3SS induction (Fig. S1B and Fig. S4C), bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium, subcultured in LB plus 20 mM sodium oxalate (to chelate calcium and induce type III secretion) and 20 mM @sm$ MgCl2 @/sm$ to an OD600 of 0.2, grown at 26 C for 1.5 h followed by 37 C for another 1.5 h.	3
For the disk diffusion method, inocula were prepared by suspending @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ colonies from LSM-cysteine plates into 5 ml of 0.85% NaCl solution (adjusted to McFarland standard 1), which were then spread onto LSM-cysteine plates. Subsequently, antimicrobial disks (BioMerieux, France), including ceftriaxone (30 mug), @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ (5 mug), tetracycline (30 mug), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (30 mug), azithromycin (15 mug), and metronidazole (5 mug), were applied. Plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 48 h at 37 C, followed by measurement of the diameters of the inhibition zones, including the diameter of the disk (mm). For each isolate, the procedures were repeated five times to evaluate day-to-day reproducibility of the method, with reproducibility defined as percentage of samples within +-4 mm variation in zone diameter. For Etests, inocula were prepared as described above, and the resuspended solution was spread onto LSM-cysteine plates. Plates were left to dry for ~15 min, after which Etest strips were applied (ceftriaxone, @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, azithromycin, and metronidazole; BioMerieux, France).	3
For visualization of the formed monomicrobial biofilm of @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$, scanning electron microscopy was performed. Membranes were removed from the medium and gently rinsed with PBS in order to detach non-adherent bacteria. Samples were fixed in @sm$ glutaraldehyde @/sm$ (48 h) and then dehydrated by applying a series of solutions of 3% acetic acid, 3% acetic acid and 25% ethanol, 3% acetic acid and 50% ethanol, and 70% ethanol, according to a previously described fixation method.	3
Free lipoic acid is produced by enzymatic cleavage of the amide bond linking the lipoyl moiety to the @sm$ lysine @/sm$ of lipoate-dependent proteins with a lipoamidase. EfLPA from @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ was previously shown to release lipoic acid from lipoate-modified proteins in E.	1
Freeze-dried @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ DSM 22959 strain obtained from DSMZ collection (Leibniz Institute DSMZ:German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) was used in present study. For long-term storage, this strain was maintained frozen at -80  C in PYG broth supplemented with 0.1% (m/v) mucin [PYGM; media composition as recommended by DSMZ except that no @sm$ resazurin @/sm$ was added], with 20% (v/v) glycerol (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). For each experiment, a glycerol stock of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ DSM 22959 was thawed and grown in PYGM broth at 37  C for 20-24 h under anaerobic conditions (85% N2, 5% H2, and 10% CO2) achieved in an anaerobic incubator (Whitley A35 HEPA anaerobic workstation, Bingley, UK).	0
From our analysis of simple @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism, we found genomic evidence suggesting that all members of  Roseburia  except  @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$  and R. sp. 831b can utilize galacturonic acid. Our analysis also suggests that all  Roseburia  spp. are able to metabolize glucose, galactose, maltose and sucrose, where only  R. inulinivorans  is likely unable to metabolize xylose, mannose and arabinose. Although all  Roseburia  spp. are missing both the mannose isomerase that converts mannose to fructose and the mannokinase that phosphorylates mannose to mannose-6P as prescribed in the KEGG pathway, a different pathway has been characterized previously from  R. intestinalis  L1-82. Like other @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ degradation pathways in  Roseburia  spp., the genes for mannose degradation and utilization are organized in an operon including a transcriptional regulator, the associated glucosidases, and an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport complex.	2
Further HPAEC analysis after acid hydrolysis of extracted and partially purified polysaccharide of @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ indicated that it was composed of five monosaccharides: galactose (47.8%), glucose (27.6%), rhamnose (15.4%), glucuronic acid (6.1%) and @sm$ glucosamine @/sm$ (3.1%) and an 1H NMR analysis showed 6 specifics resonance peaks (Fig.	1
Further evidence for the possible involvement of @sm$ erythritol @/sm$ metabolism in virulence has been suggested by Burkhardt et al., who demonstrated that inactivation of the eryC gene significantly reduced the intramacrophagic and intramurine fitness of B. suis . Moreover, @sm$ erythritol @/sm$ metabolism is connected in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ with iron uptake by the production of siderophores 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHBA) and brucebactin. An entC mutant unable to synthesise DHBA was not able to cause abortions in pregnant goats, underscoring the role played by DHBA in the virulence. An entF mutant unable to produce brucebactin did not grow in the presence of @sm$ erythritol @/sm$ under iron limiting conditions suggesting that much more iron is needed for the efficient metabolism of @sm$ erythritol @/sm$. On the other hand, vaccine strain S19 does not express the same levels of virB genes encoding a type IV secretion system (T4SS) as other @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ strains, including B.	1
Further investigation of fecal microbial metabolites uncovered a boost in gut butyrate production and a decline in @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production in HRUP goats, which was in accordance with the enhanced butanoate metabolism pathway in microbial functions. Synchronously, a prominent increase in fecal BCAA levels was noted for HRUP group, which might contribute to an important source for the above-mentioned elevated serum BCAAs. Since gut microbiota can both produce (e.g., Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus) and use (e.g., @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Eubacterium siraeum) BCAAs, the greater fecal BCAA levels represented a net result from the bacteria biosynthesis and catabolism of BCAAs. It is well established that BCAAs share common biosynthetic pathways all stemming from intermediates from pyruvate metabolism, a central component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which perfectly links the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Taken together, HRUP intervention elicited a shift from @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production toward butyrate and BCAA production involving the enrichment of gut Eubacterium members.	2
Furthermore the authors showed that a higher presence of Akkermansia muciniphila, and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ in PD patients, and identified a new research target in PD research with the use of metabolic networks. Hertel et al. confirmed these results by using the same approach as Baldini et al. to construct and simulate personalized community networks of 31 early stage, drug naive PD patients and 28 age matched controls from data obtained from Bedarf et al.. Simulation with FBA concluded that four microbial reactions involved in @sm$ homoserine @/sm$ metabolism are altered in PD patients, which is consistent with measured levels in plasma of PD patients and @sm$ homoserine @/sm$, the precursor of methionine, is part of sulfur metabolism. Furthermore, the authors showed an increase in two bacterial species both involved in sulfur metabolism, @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ and A.	2
Furthermore, @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$ can convert daidzein and DHD into S-equol. Recently, studies have shown that Eubacterium ramulus isolated from human feces is able to undergo anaerobic C-ring cleavage to convert genistine into 6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin, followed by 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid, and directly convert daidzein into @sm$ O-desmethylangolensin @/sm$ (@sm$ O-DMA @/sm$). Other bacteria, such as Eubacterium ramulus and Clostridium sp. HGH 136, can convert daidzein to @sm$ O-DMA @/sm$.	1
Furthermore, LIP-mix reinforced @sm$ MPTP @/sm$-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage in the ST and SN. The numbers of dopaminergic fibers and neurons in the ST and SN were significantly decreased after @sm$ MPTP @/sm$ injection, and LIP-mix treatment caused a further loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ST and SN of @sm$ MPTP @/sm$-induced PD mice (Fig. 3C-F). The level of TH positive protein in the ST also showed a similar trend (Fig. 3G). However, there was no significant difference in the levels of dopaminergic fibers and neurons between the control group and LIP-mix group (Fig. 3C-G). Then we conducted additional experiments in which mice were orally administered @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and S. mutans without LIP induction, and then induced PD using @sm$ MPTP @/sm$ (Fig. S4A). We found that without LIP these two bacteria scarcely colonized in the gut (Fig. S4B) and did not exacerbate PD (Fig. S4C). These data suggest that @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and S.	3
Furthermore, a number of Bifidobacterium, including @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, were present at higher relative abundance in the MAP-exposed group. This species is considered a specialised member of the Bifidobacterium genus and had been thought to be exclusively associated with animal faeces. However, the species has also been reported in a number of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis studies. Notably, examined antibody-mediated immune responsiveness to the cell surface of mucosal bacteria for IgG and IgA serum antibodies and noted that @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$ IgG responses were significantly higher in the ulcerative colitis cohort. The other Bifidobacterium species enriched in the exposed group was B. adolescentis. This species is known to produce lactate and a small quantity of @sm$ acetate @/sm$ that may drive butyrate formation in other bacteria.	1
Furthermore, a volcano plot showed that a large number of metabolites such as citric acid, alanine, glycine, tryptophan, @sm$ xanthine @/sm$, hypoxanthine and pyruvic acid along with @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ were higher in IBS patients as compared to healthy subjects, whereas only a few variables such as Clostridium sp., glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinic acid were found in lower abundance (Figure 1C).	0
Furthermore, an increased abundance of several SCFA-producing genera, including @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, Sphaerochaeta, and Catenibacillus, were observed in the FA-H group. @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, which was isolated from human feces, is strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, and negative in terms of the intestinal permeability of the host. Different from other members of phylum Spirochaetes, Sphaerochaeta genomes lacked the genes about motility and associated signal transduction; however, they are highly enriched in genes related to fermentation and carbohydrate metabolism. Consequently, they grow as biofilms and by fermenting carbohydrates to @sm$ formate @/sm$, acetate, propionate, and iso-butyrate.	1
Furthermore, as shown in Fig 3c, the relative abundance of @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$ and Streptococcus thermophilus did not change significantly after pinworm infection; however, an increase in the proportion of these 2 species was detected 2 weeks after @sm$ mebendazole @/sm$ deworming treatment (@gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$: pinworm (+) @sm$ mebendazole @/sm$ (+) vs. pinworm (+) @sm$ mebendazole @/sm$ (-), 3.07% +- 5.52% vs. 1.00% +- 2.00%, fold = 3.08, p = 9.18 x 10-5, FDR = 0.034; Streptococcus thermophiles: pinworm (+) @sm$ mebendazole @/sm$ (+) vs. pinworm (+) @sm$ mebendazole @/sm$ (-), 0.89% +- 2.04% vs.	3
Furthermore, both Eubacterium siraeum and @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$, known to trigger intestinal inflammation, positively correlated with SBP. Although further validation is needed, this suggests that certain gut bacteria may drive intestinal gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation, which was confirmed by measurement of plasma markers and gut-targetted proinflammatory cells (Figure 4). In contrast, bacterial taxa such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, critical for foraging host mucosal @sm$ glycan @/sm$ as well as reinforcing mucosal barrier and immune system against pathogens, were inversely correlated with SBP (Figure 2). Another bacterium, E. rectale was the most significantly enriched taxa in the REF cohort by LEfSe analysis (Figure 1E). A study by Mahowald et al. showed what might happen in the normotensive gut by using a simplified microbiota model only comprising B. thetaiotaomicron and E. rectale. They demonstrated that B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to the presence of E. rectale by increasing expression of various genes involved in the harvest of host-derived mucin @sm$ glycans @/sm$ that E. rectale cannot utilize. Exchange of bacterial signals between the two strains caused B. thetaiotaomicron to generate more mucosal @sm$ glycans @/sm$ in the intestine and E. rectale to decrease production of @sm$ glycan @/sm$-degrading enzymes and increase butyrate production, which strengthened the intestinal epithelium barrier.	2
Furthermore, low estrogen and @sm$ progesterone @/sm$ levels and existing menstrual blood in the female vagina are related to the decrease in some microorganisms and the enrichment of others. Accordingly, during menses, reproductive-aged women may have a low amount of Lactobacillus spp. and a high abundance of other species, such as G. vaginalis, Streptococcus spp., and @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ spp.	3
Furthermore, subsequent evaluation of adjuvanted formulations of the latter revealed that the use of both @sm$ alum @/sm$ and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) in an oil/water emulsion enhanced the induced anti-LPS serum antibody (Ab) response. The adjuvant effect of @sm$ alum @/sm$ remained stable for at least 3 months. With regards to conjugation chemistry, original work on SD1 paved the way to investigations on SF2a and @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$.	3
Furthermore, the alterations of microbiota were held accountable in oxaliplatin (OXA) chemoresistance in colorectal cancer and lymphoma, without understanding of the specific changes that were responsible for it, as observed in treatments with CTX, for which efficacy is directly correlated with the presence of Enterococcus hirae and @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$, probably via @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$) production.	1
Furthermore, the bacteria species of Bacteroidetes mainly produces acetate and @sm$ propionic acid @/sm$, whereas the bacteria species of Firmicutes has butyric acid as its primary metabolic terminal product. Dietary Gly-Gln supplementation may modify metabolic profiles of gut microbiota. In more detail, at species level dietary Gly-Gln supplementation increased the relative abundance of 12 species (Barnesiella intestinihominis, Ruminococcaceae, Blautia wexlerae, Erysipelotrichaceae, @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, Elusimicrobium minutum, Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotella, pullicaecorum, Barnesiella, Acholeplasma, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) on day 38 and six species (Prevotella, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridium XlVa, Clostridiales, and Porphyromonadaceae) on day 49.	1
Gamithromycin, a semi-synthetic 15-membered macrolide, features a distinctive alkylated nitrogen at the 7a carbon of the @sm$ lactone @/sm$ ring, a characteristic commonly associated with azalides. Approved for use in cattle, pigs, and sheep, it is specifically indicated for the treatment of respiratory disease and infectious pododermatitis. While not officially approved in poultry, studies have demonstrated the efficacy of subcutaneously injected gamithromycin against @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ in turkey.	3
Gamma irradiation of mice led to increased proportions of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, but reduced proportions of Barnesiella, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Oscillibacter, Pseudoflavonifractor and Mucispirillum in the large intestine. In the small intestine, irradiation led to an increase in Corynebacterium and decrease in @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$. In addition, Gerassy-Vainberg et al. exposed mice to rectal irradiation, leading to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and a decreased abundance of Firmicutes. When exposed to low-dose irradiation, mice showed an increased abundance of Clostridium, Helicobacter and Oscillibacter and a decreased abundance of Bacteroides and Barnesiella. The latter study also showed that irradiated mice had perturbed metabolite levels (e.g., downregulation of glucose, @sm$ pyruvic acid @/sm$, pinitol, and upregulation of hydroquinone, octadecanol and O-phosphoserine), which were predicted to be involved in glucagon signaling, central carbon metabolism and type II diabetes.	0
Garlic ingredients such as allicin, @sm$ diallyl sulfide @/sm$, and aged garlic extract also inhibited the growth of periodontitis-causing bacteria such as P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$.	3
Genes coding for enzymes of complete lysine fermentation pathway leading to butyrate production were present in three genera of the phylum Bacteroidetes (Muribaculum, Butyricimonas and @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$) and the majority of Flavonifractor isolates belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. Butyricimonas and @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ also encoded the whole pathway required for the conversion of succinate and 4-hydroxybutyrate into butyrate (Fig. 1). Terminal steps in butyrate production were dependent on transferases transferring CoA moiety from @sm$ butyryl-CoA @/sm$ to acetate, acetoacetate or 4-hydroxybutyrate, or phosphate butyryltransferase (PBT) and butyrate kinase (BUK). Surprisingly, we did not find butyrate kinase in all isolates using the PBT - BUK pathway for butyrate release from @sm$ butyryl-CoA. @/sm$ In such a case, butyrate-phosphate may serve for substrate phosphorylation in enzymatic reactions similar to acetate-phosphate.	1
Genital and bladder infections increase due to the depletion or distraction of normal urogenital microflora, in particular @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species as the most prevalent bacteria in healthy humans. The growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics requires the development of an alternative method to prevent and treat urogenital infections. Multi-drug resistance of uropathogens has been attributed to commonly used antibiotics, including ampicillin, @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, etc.. On the other hand, vancomycin and teicoplanin have been found active against most Gram-positive bacteria, while some lactobacilli have been found to be resistant to these glycopeptides. Possible prophylactic effects of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ strains against experimental E.	4
Genome mining efforts to identify the biosynthetic genes in @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ revealed that there is no comparable flagellar genetic locus. In addition, BLAST searches using the H. pylori and C. jejuni biosynthetic enzymes as queries identified only four Pse homologs in the genome of @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ - TDE0714 (PseB), TDE0725 (PseC), TDE0960 (PseI), and TDE1917 (PseF). Interestingly, these 4 homologs were also found in T. pallidum, (TP0077, TP0078, TP0562, and TP0289), and they share high sequence identities (50~70%) with their counterparts in @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$. These findings suggest that the flagellins of T. pallidum are probably modified with the same @sm$ glycan @/sm$ as those of @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$. From a biosynthetic perspective, no homologs of PseH (N-acetyltransferase) and PseG (nucleotidase) were identified in either of the @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ genomes. PseH is responsible for the N-4 acetylation of UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-beta-l-AltNAc to form UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-beta-l-AltNAc. PseH is responsible for removal of UDP from C1 of the PseH product to form 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy- beta-l-altropyranose. Although such an apparent absence of two key biosynthetic enzymes may simply be due to very low levels of sequence similarity with the Campylobacter and Helicobacter enzymes, it is tempting to speculate that a divergence in the biosynthetic pathway may have occurred between these organisms and @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ spp., which is reflected in the novel acyl moiety identified at N7 in the final Pse sugar (N4 in the biosynthetic precursor sugar).	1
Genomic DNA was isolated from @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ F6-1 cells by a standard protocol for Gram-positive bacteria after lysozyme (10 mg mL-1)/mutanolysin (700 u mL-1) treatment of bacterial cells (Colmin et al.). Plasmid DNA extraction from E. coli and standard DNA manipulations were performed according to established procedures (Sambrook and Russell). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Fermentas (Waltham, MA, USA). PCR reagents and enzymes were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Villebon sur Yvette, France). @sm$ Oligonucleotides @/sm$ (Supplementary Table S1) were obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).	0
Given this evidence, some authors tried to address the exact role of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in this condition; in a study by Li et al., Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice prone to the atherosclerotic disease on a normal or Western diet were treated with live @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$. The treatment significantly reduced the dimensions of the atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta induced by the Western diet and reduced local and systemic inflammation as well. Changes were associated with a marked attenuation in metabolic endotoxemia and gut permeability, suggesting that @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ could attenuate atherosclerotic lesions through the restoration of gut barrier function. On the contrary, @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ has also been associated with the production of trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of @sm$ L-carnitine @/sm$ that was reported to accelerate atherosclerosis through the impairment of the reverse cholesterol transport and the shift of the phenotype of artery wall macrophages; however, the authors did not investigate whether @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ was associated with enhanced atherogenesis.	1
Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (Gcd) has been discovered in the @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ fermenters @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium symbiosum, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as well as in the benzoate oxidizer/synthesizer Syntrophus aciditrophicus.	1
Glutamate induced the synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase 50-fold during anaerobic growth of @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ and, in the absence of glutamate, this enzyme was even more active in cultures sparged with N2/CO2(95:5, v/v). Enzyme synthesis was partially repressed when the inlet gas was passed through heated copper but totally repressed when the inlet gas was passed through alkaline pyrogallol and reduced benzyl viologen (a treatment which would remove CO2 as well as @sm$ O2 @/sm$). Fumarate hydratase activity also decreased but alcohol dehydrogenase and the sum of the succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase activities increased when residual @sm$ O2 @/sm$ was removed from the sparging gas. Soluble cytochromes a1 and c552.5 were detected in rigorously anaerobic cultures. Thus traces of @sm$ O2 @/sm$ which contaminate commercial compressed N2 are sufficient to induce 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase synthesis and to affect significantly the synthesis and incorporation of respiratory chain components into the cytoplasmic membrane.	3
Glutaraldehyde-resistant @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$ have been isolated from endoscope washer disinfectors and endoscope rinse water. The mechanism of glutaraldehyde resistance is not well understood. Two spontaneous, glutaraldehyde-resistant mutants of the sensitive type strain, @gm$ NCTC 946 @/gm$, were investigated. The colony morphology of the two mutants differed from that of the the type strain: colonies of the former were dry and waxy whereas those of the latter were smooth and shiny. Increased resistance to glutaraldehyde of the mutants was matched by small increases in the MICs of rifampicin and @sm$ ethambutol @/sm$ but not isoniazid.	4
Glycerol and @sm$ sodium hydroxide @/sm$ (@sm$ NaOH @/sm$) was purchased from R&M Marketing (UK). The bacterial cultures of Gram-negative bacteria @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis UPMC1175 and antibiotics (Streptomycin) was obtained from the Institute of Bioscience Universiti Putra Malaysia.	0
Grids with adherent cells were either (i) negatively stained for direct visualization on transmission electron microscope (TEM) or (ii) labeled with the anti-@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ LPS O-chain, M epitope, mAb A156b3b2 before staining as described previsously by Fretin et al.. For immunolabeling, after 10 min on the drop of bacterial suspension, the carbon Formvar-coated grid was placed onto drops (15 to 35 mul) of the following reagents on the same parafilm sheet: 5 washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-@sm$ glycine @/sm$ 5% (3 sec each), PBS-bovine serum albumin (BSA)(1 min), monoclonal antibody A156b3b2 diluted 1/20 in PBS-BSA 5% (1 h), five washes in PBS (10 sec each), rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to +- 15 nm colloidal gold diluted 1/20 in PBS-BSA (1 h), three washes in PBS (10 sec each), 2 washes in distilled water (10 sec each).	0
Group one (negative control) was given access to water and regular feed, group two (positive control) was dosed with 107 CFU/ml of @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$, and groups 3-6 were dosed with 107 @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ for 3 days and treated with extract concentrations of 12, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg bw respectively for seven days. Results: Higher @sm$ ascorbic acid @/sm$ values in Ferric reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) and Hydroxyl radical scavenging (HRS) were recorded in the positive control (0.05 +- 0.01, 41 +- 0.05) than in the extract-treated (0.02 +- 0.14, 30 +- 0.02).	3
Growth in liquid medium containing glucose or HA as a carbon source was examined with @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ (Fig. 2). Although @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ showed only weak growth without addition of saccharides, the bacterial cells vigorously proliferated and reached the stationary phase within 1 day after inoculation when glucose was added as a carbon source. Intriguingly, @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ completely degraded HA within 2 days without showing assimilation. In fact, oral spirochaetes, including @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$, were reported to degrade HA and @sm$ CSC @/sm$ by an extracellular enzyme. The results suggested that some oral-abundant bacteria (e.g., @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$) degrade GAGs specifically for invasive penetration into host tissues.	0
Gut microbiota like Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ and Lactobacillus synthesize short-chain fatty acid metabolites (SCFAs) from dietary fiber. SCFAs such as @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and butyrate can enter circulation and inhibit HDAC activity in blood and select tissues including the liver, adipose tissue, brain and myocardium. Indeed, high abundances of the SCFA-producing commensal strains, especially butyrate-producing strains, have been shown to inhibit HDACs. Such effects can be protective both locally in the GI tract, as well as systemically, such as in the heart. Regarding local protection, butyrate-mediated HDAC inhibition attenuated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by intestinal macrophages. This is important as GI inflammation can result in chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation and is associated with several diseases including CVDs. Regarding systemic protection, butyrate inhibits class I HDAC activity in the heart, which attenuates cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction across several experimental animal models of CVD. @sm$ Acetate @/sm$ and propionate are also HDAC inhibitors, albeit less potent, and have been shown to block common hallmarks of CVD upon GI microbial synthesis.	1
Hallella seregens is a later heterotypic synonym of @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$. Compared to values directly calculated from genome sequences, the G+C content mentioned in many species descriptions is too imprecise; moreover, corrected G@sm$ +C @/sm$ content values have a significantly better fit to the phylogeny.	0
He was administered anti-tuberculous medicine including INH, RFP and EB empirically, and later prednisolone and @sm$ azathioprine @/sm$. Despite of these medications, there was no improvement. After admission to our hospital, positive results for acid fast bacilli were obtained from both sputum and pleural fluid, and they were identified as @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$. He was treated successfully with the combination of INH, RFP, EB plus SM and CAM. The expectoration of @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ was ceased after 4 months of treatment.	3
Hence the present study was extract of green seaweed Caulerpa peltata, red Hypnea Valencia and brown Sargassum myriocystum three seaweeds were used for ecofriendly synthesis of @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles. However, till date, there are no reports on the synthesis of @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles with these seaweeds Caulerpa peltata, Hypnea Valencia and Sargassum myriocystum and very limited studies have been reported on the other seaweeds for biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles. The preliminary screening of three seaweeds by physico-chemical parameter such as concentration of metals, concentration of seaweed extract, temperature, pH and reaction time. This parameters were used to assess which seaweed can be rapid extracellular synthesis and suitable condition for synthesis of @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles. The obtained @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopic analysis followed by, Dynamic light Scattering (DLS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements, Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Based on the FTIR results, fucoidan water soluble pigments present in S. myriocystum leaf extract is responsible for reduction and stabilization of @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles. This S. myriocystum is available in all season in the gulf of mannar, plenty and it is easy to make large scale production of @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ nanoparticles. @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles were obtained by using seaweed as both the reducing and stabilizing agent. Antibacterial activity was also demonstrated using the prepared nanoparticles on Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (@gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$, Neisseria gonorrohea, and Klebsiella pneumonia).	3
Hence, the sequence comparison between several TolQ homologs from Pedobacter, Parapedobacter and Olivibacter (~2.0 Gya) and the flagellar motor protein PomA from @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ (~0.8 Gya) reveals an interesting pattern where the number of positively charged residues (usually @sm$ Lys @/sm$) at the S4-like segment is gradually replaced by Arg. Notably, in true V-sensors, for instance, in kHv1, Ci-VSP or the Shaker KV channels this last amino acid is preferred, probably because their unique hydration properties which provide better efficiency to facilitate the V-sensor motion. Moreover, the guanidinium group of Arg allows interactions in at least three possible directions, which enables its side-chain to form a larger number of electrostatic interactions in comparison to @sm$ Lys @/sm$, and favors more rotameric conformations due to its size, side-chain flexibility and higher capability of carrying charges. This is also consistent with the study of Berezovsky et al. which clearly demonstrate that in hyperthermophilic genomes a greater proportion of positively charged residues is almost entirely due to @sm$ Lys @/sm$ but not Arg since MD simulations show that @sm$ Lys @/sm$ has a much greater number of accessible rotamers than Arg and, in consequence, those proteins are overall more flexible.	0
Here we set out to investigate how zinc, @sm$ manganese @/sm$, and iron affect growth of two distinct @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species, L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, in controlled conditions with varied growth media. We report metal ion content for both species grown in rich and defined media, and show that among the transition metals studied, @sm$ manganese @/sm$ was most abundant, then zinc and iron. We describe how growth kinetics of each species varies in nutrient-rich complex and metal-limited defined media and furthermore, how subculturing with fixed concentrations of metals or mucin affects the growth response to varied zinc, iron, or @sm$ manganese @/sm$ in defined medium. The mucin glycoprotein is a primary component of the host mucus layer lining the GIT, and can bind metals. Our results show that some subculture conditions produce distinct effects on the subsequent growth response to varied metal availability, supporting the idea that the local intestinal environment will influence how these bacteria survive within the gut microbiota. Additionally, excess zinc reduced the growth of L. acidophilus to a larger extent than L. plantarum. This work lays a foundation for detailed studies of the metallobiology of intestinal @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species.	3
Here, we focused on XOS utilisation by Limosilactobacillus reuteri and @gm$ Blautia producta @/gm$, two beneficial Gram-positive bacterial symbionts found in a wide range of vertebrates. L. reuteri strains have a long history of beneficial dietary effects and are associated with a wide range of animal hosts. In contrast, the potential benefits of @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ have only recently begun to be appreciated, and it is now considered a beneficial genus with potential probiotic properties. Despite their beneficial association with host, the dietary @sm$ glycan @/sm$-utilising potential of @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ strains remains to be determined.	2
Hesperidin, nobiletin, and @sm$ tangeretin @/sm$ are the quality control index components of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium. The absolute bioavailability of @sm$ tangeretin @/sm$ is 27.11% because of its extensive biotransformation via CYP1A2 in the liver. Hesperidin and its metabolite hesperetin showed an inhibitory effect on the activities of CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, and P-gp. @sm$ Tangeretin @/sm$ exerts an inhibitive effect on OATP2B1, but can significantly increase the mRNA expression of CYP3A4 by regulating PXR. Nobiletin is both a CYP1A2 inhibitor and inducer, while @sm$ tangeretin @/sm$ is an inducer of CYP3A4. In addition, nobiletin induces CYP1 enzymatic activity, CYP1A1 protein, and CYP1B1 mRNA levels in MCF7 cells. Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium has a regulatory effect on intestinal microorganisms, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing and anti-inflammatory bacteria, including @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Lactobacillus and Allobaculum.	0
Hierarchical utilization refers to catabolite repression, in which preferred carbon sources prevent the utilization of other substrates, and a variety of mechanisms are used, depending on the bacterial genus; the classic example of which is glucose-@sm$ lactose @/sm$ diauxic growth of Escherichia coli. It is now well accepted that carbon catabolite repression controls the sequential catabolism of preferred carbon substrates, thereby enhancing the ability of bacteria to compete in their natural habitats. Bacteria of the genus @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ are considered generalists because they are isolated from a wide range of niches and have the remarkable property of metabolizing a wide range of compounds as a source of carbon and energy. @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ are metabolically versatile and behave as intelligent eaters that preferentially catabolize organic acids, especially tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, rather than carbohydrates.	2
Higher levels of Escherichia and Veillonella accompanied higher area under the @sm$ glucose @/sm$ curve and diminished beta cell function (FDR adjusted LRT p < 0.05, see  Figure 4 ). However, Escherichia was the only genus that was significantly associated with glycated hemoglobin (log2 fold change 0.5, FDR-adjusted LRT p = 0.04), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index, FDR adjusted LRT p = 7e-5). Higher levels of Blautia and @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ on the other hand were associated with lower areas under the @sm$ glucose @/sm$ curve and normal beta cell function (FDR adjusted LRT p < 0.05, see  Figure 4 ). Thus, the associations with markers of metabolic health were consistent with the results of oral @sm$ glucose @/sm$ tolerance tests.	3
HmuS, a close HemS ortholog from @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, degrades heme to mixed @sm$ biliverdin @/sm$ beta- and delta-isomers in vitro (Onzuka et al.,). Heme degradation using either ascorbate or ferredoxin/NADPH both with and without catalase produced @sm$ biliverdin @/sm$ while consuming molecular oxygen and releasing CO. The spectral readings of reactions performed with and without catalase remained the same. Although the reaction was slower with catalase, the heme was eventually converted to @sm$ biliverdin @/sm$.	1
However, @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ is the only species to be significantly associated with periodontal disease, as summarised by. One of the most common treatment options for periodontitis is @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ and is one of the few widely used antibiotics with efficacy against methanogens such as @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$. Thus, the @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$-associated suppression of @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ may play a significant role in effective treatment. Conversely, a separate study showed @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ to have no significant increase in prevalence for peri-implantitis, suggesting a potential for disease-specific associations in the oral microbiome. Specific amplification of archaeal 16S rRNA and mcrA showed M. smithii sequences in chronic paravertebral abscess of a 41-year-old man. The group was also able to isolate @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ from a nasal sample of a patient suffering from chronic sinusitis. There is also growing evidence that methanogens may contribute to disease progression of brain abscesses. One recent study by showed a higher prevalence of archaeal species by PCR in brain abscess specimens compared with healthy controls. Additionally, metagenomics analysis identified @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ within multiple abscess samples, as well as several bacterial species, including Staphylococcus intermedius. Mice infected cerebrally with @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, S. intermedius or both showed significantly increased mortality in all test cases compared to controls. Additionally, co-infection with @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ and S. intermedius showed an increased mortality rate compared to separate infections, suggesting a syntrophic relationship between the microbes. @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ was further observed in a community-acquired brain abscess of a 30-year-old woman along with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, again suggesting a potential role for @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ in infections associated with anaerobic bacteria.	3
However, @sm$ zinc oxide @/sm$ nanoparticles (@sm$ ZnO @/sm$ NPs) are used more commonly than zinc nanoparticles because of their superior antibacterial properties. @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ nanoparticles are one of many metal oxides utilized for antimicrobial applications, but they have drawn much more attention due to their distinctive and intriguing features. These distinctive characteristics include a high surface-to-volume ratio, UV radiation absorption, transparency for visible light, electrical conductivity, piezoelectric properties, semiconductivity, nontoxicity to mammalian cells, widespread availability, cost effectiveness, and prolonged environmental stability. Zinc gets absorbed excessively by the cells compared to copper and iron ions as Zn2+ acts as a strong Lewis acid, making it highly corrosive in nature and therefore preventing copper and iron from being absorbed by the cell. @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ NPs have been shown to be effective against both Gram-positive strains such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative strains such as E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni. However, they exhibit greater sensitivity and susceptibility to Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative ones. Studies have also demonstrated that photoactivated @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ NPs were effective against Listeria, E. coli, B. subtilis, and @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$.- Overall, @sm$ ZnO @/sm$ NPs exhibit antimicrobial activity through three main mechanisms: cell membrane damage brought on by electrostatic interactions of nanoparticles with membranes, release of Zn ions that alter the bacterial microenvironment, and induction of oxidative stress brought on by the formation of free radicals and ROS.	3
However, LEfSe analysis showed that the BM microbiota from mothers who delivered via CS was rich in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (Figure 4B), which was supported by edgeR (data not shown). IAP during delivery also had no significant effect on the alpha and beta diversity of the BM microbiota. Moreover, the two antibiotics administered to mothers (cefazolin sodium and @sm$ cefuroxime sodium @/sm$) had no significant effect on the microbiota diversity of BM (Figures 4G,H).	4
However, another study by concluded that while @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ was susceptible to various antibiotics, including amoxicillin-clavulanate and meropenem; it did not appear to be resistant to vancomycin. The present study found that both isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, meropenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin hydrochloride. Studies have demonstrated that treating bacteremia caused by @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone monotherapy may increase mortality. Ceftriaxone resistance is likely due to the presence of the beta-lactamase gene identified in most @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ genomes.	3
However, by using LAB fermentation, the formation of biogenic amines (@sm$ BA @/sm$) should be evaluated, because these low molecular weight organic bases can be formed as a result of normal LAB metabolic activity by the decarboxylation of wheat bran substrate amino acids. LAB mainly produces histamine, tyramine and putrescine via decarboxylase or deiminase activities. It was reported that putrescine and cadaverine could be formed by Lactobacillus buchneri strains, tyramine by several Leuconostoc strains, Lactobacillus and Enterococci, and histamine by @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$. @sm$ BA @/sm$ are important compounds in maintaining cells, as well as the proper viability of the body's metabolic processes, such as protein synthesis, hormone synthesis, and DNA replication. However, despite the positive effects on the body, physiological and toxicological effects (diarrhoea, food poisoning, vomiting, sweating or tachycardia) of @sm$ BA @/sm$, especially in high concentrations, make them undesirable compounds in food or feed. In this study, to select the most appropriate technology, various parameters of processed and untreated wheat bran were analysed: acidity and microbiological parameters, concentration of sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, and maltose), free amino acid (FAA) content, and @sm$ BA @/sm$ formation; the influence of the different treatments on the concentrations of 20 mycotoxins (alternariol; alternariol monomethyl ether; 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol; deoxynivalenol; deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside; 15-acetoxyscirpenol; enniatin A and A1; fumonisin B1 and B2; meleagrin; sterigmatocystin; ochratoxin A and B; T-2 toxin; HT-2 toxin; fusarenone; neosolaniol; aflatoxin B1) were also evaluated.	1
However, gene deletion was unsuccessful for most of the amino acid biosynthesis genes of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$, suggesting that they are indispensable for its survival. Thus, it appears that our strategy cannot be applied to other genome-reduced bacteria because the genes selectively conserved after reductive evolution may be essential for the bacterium. However, there are many dispensable genes even in bacteria with highly reduced genomes, such as Mycoplasma genitalium. It has been shown that the intracellular pathogen Francisella possesses intact biosynthetic pathways for both @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ and asparagine but still takes up these amino acids from infected cells. Furthermore, Salmonella has developed functionally redundant systems for the biosynthesis and transport of important amino acids for growth and virulence during evolution. Thus, many pathogens, including intracellular bacteria, rely on the transporter-mediated acquisition of amino acids from the host. Overall, it appears that in many bacteria, dispensable but important genes are functionally compensated by other systems. Notably, like mycoplasmas, @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ possesses many transporters, with a high percentage (minimum 13.7%) of its genes devoted to transport functions, suggesting that @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ can acquire proline from the environment.	2
However, in an interesting study, lipidic nanocapsules loaded with a mixture of carvacol and eugenol (phenols), cinnamaldehyde (@sm$ aldehyde @/sm$) and/or beta-caryophyllene (alkene) showed excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against A. baumannii. Intraperitoneal administration of this formulation resulted in increased survival in sepsis murine model. Alipour et al. reported a decrease in bacterial count of A. baumannii and @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ when exposed to liposomal formulation of polymixin B (in 2:1 molar ratio of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol).	3
However, in the in vitro model GIS1, there were increases in the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Pediococcus genera. A decrease in total SCFAs, especially the ratio between butyric and propionic acids, was also observed (Table 2), while cyclamate inhibited the anaerobic fermentation of @sm$ glucose @/sm$.	2
However, its ability to utilize glucose and acetic acid for growth may explain why it exhibits substrate K as the preferred one rather than G and @sm$ L. @/sm$ Furthermore, this study revealed that, among the oligosaccharides, fermentation of K2 led to the greatest abundance of Faecalibacterium (p < 0.05), followed by L2, but not in sample G2. More importantly, this is the first report to find that, as shown in Figure 5A, Megasphaera was selected to be significantly (p < 0.05) enriched following the fermentation of the six substrates, and the fermentation of the six substrates could strongly depress the growth of Klebsiella. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 5(Ab), Bifidobacterium was also significantly (p < 0.05) enriched in @sm$ L @/sm$ and G substrates, but not in K substrates following the fermentation, which may be due to their faster fermentation kinetics for samples @sm$ L @/sm$ and G. Roseburia and @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ (Figure 5A) were reported to be unable to utilize mannose, which may be the main reason for a reduced relative abundance of this genus.	2
However, its function remains poorly elucidated in zoonotic @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ (@gm$ SS @/gm$). Here, a gidA and mnmE double knock-out (DKO) strain was constructed to systematically decode regulatory characteristics of GidA-MnmE pathway via proteomic. TMT labelled proteomics analysis identified that many proteins associated with cell divison and growth, @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis, virulence, especially arginine deiminase system (ADS) responsible for arginine metabolism were down-regulated in DKO mutant compared with the wild-type (WT) SC19. Accordingly, phenotypic experiments showed that the DKO strain displayed decreased in arginine consumption and ammonia production, deficient growth, and attenuated pathogenicity. Moreover, targeted metabolomic analysis identified that arginine was accumulated in DKO mutant as well. Therefore, these data provide molecular mechanisms for GidA-MnmE modification pathway in regulation of arginine metabolism, cell growth and pathogenicity of @gm$ SS @/gm$.	1
However, only two @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ strains (CFR R38 and CFR R35) were found to degrade sodium phytate. These strains showed phytase activity of 213 and 89 U at 50 degrees C, respectively and poor acid phosphatase activity. These strains were further evaluated for additional characteristic features. At pH 2, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ strains CFR R38 and CFR R35 showed 50.7 and 48.5 percentage survivability after 2 h of incubation respectively and they could also withstand 0.3% ox-bile. These cultures exhibited 54.6 and 44.8% of hydrophobicity to @sm$ xylene @/sm$, antibacterial activity against food borne pathogens and possessed beta-galactosidase activity.	3
However, peroxiredoxins have also been reported to play a role in the detoxification of RNS, with ahpC mutants of @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ , Francisella tularensis , Brucella abortus , M. tuberculosis, and M. smegmatis  showing increased sensitivity to @sm$ peroxynitrite @/sm$. Also, H. pylori AhpC reduces @sm$ peroxynitrite @/sm$ to nitrite and is proposed to contribute to H.	3
However, strain Intestinimonas AF211 was a human isolate and showed physiological differences with @gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$ from mouse (to be reported elsewhere). Butyrate was found to be a major metabolite from all substrates where growth was observed (Supplementary Table 1). Intestinimonas AF211 hardly grew on @sm$ glucose @/sm$ in mineral medium (generation time of 88 days), but its growth rate tripled in the presence of acetate and yeast extract. In media containing 20 mM @sm$ glucose @/sm$ with 20 mM acetate and 2% yeast extract, Intestinimonas AF211 produced up to 4.4 mM butyrate and trace amounts of lactate and ethanol (2-week incubation).	2
However, the day 14 control and monensin-treated groups clustered with all day 7 groups, whereas the day 14 monensin/@sm$ virginiamycin @/sm$ and monensin/tylosin treatment groups clustered with the day 35 groups. A PCoA plot was also generated using all of the amplicon sequencing reads, and the samples were predominantly clustered according to bird age although the treatment groups at later timepoints also clustered separate from control groups of the same timepoint (Fig. S2). Venn diagrams were constructed to depict shared and unique OTUs among the groups examined at each timepoint. At 14 days after the start of treatment, 192 (18.9%) OTUs were shared among all groups studied, while 507 (49.9%) were unique to one of the four different treatment groups (Fig. 7). RDP classification of the unique OTUs belonging to the monensin/@sm$ virginiamycin @/sm$ and monensin/tylosin treatment groups revealed that most of the sequences were classified within the family Ruminococcaceae, including the genera @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$, Subdoligranulum, and Sedimentibacter, all absent from the control group.	3
However, the same bacteria when grown on @sm$ glucose @/sm$ produces butyrate instead of propionate. Similarly, butyrate is produced by the Megasphaera elsdenii (Clostridium cluster IX) when they are grown on @sm$ glucose @/sm$, but the same bacteria produce propionate when grown on lactate. Both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes enter the succinate pathway via methylmalonyl-CoA (decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA produces propionyl-CoA). Firmicutes produces propionate from organic acids, whereas Bacteroides utilize peptides and polysaccharides for the production of propionates. @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ can grow only on succinates, whereas Viellonela parvula uses lactate as the main substrate; however, they can get additional energy from succinates.	2
However, the variation of indole-3-acetate together with red meat intake and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ was able to potentially explain the improvement of postoperative insulin resistance. @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ is a producer of indole-3-acetate, and both were increased after RYGB. Indole-3-acetate activates aryl hydrocarbon receptors, reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. In addition, @sm$ indole @/sm$ derivates stimulate insulin secretion through the GLP-1 release. Furthermore, higher plasmatic levels of indole-3-acetic acid have been associated with lower insulin resistance after sleeve gastrectomy. Despite that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the interaction of food intake, tryptophan metabolism, and gut microbiota variables on glycemic homeostasis, in addition to reporting that alterations of red meat intake, indole-3-acetate, and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ together affects insulin resistance after RYGB.	1
However, this idea has been challenged by the observation that Bacteroides can produce an antagonistic form of @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) in the gut that influences susceptibility to allergies and autoimmunity, which turns out to be a potential activator of innate immunity. With the help of metagenomic sequencing analysis it was revealed that Bacteroidetes species contribute 79% of the @sm$ LPS @/sm$ biosynthesis in healthy volunteers, thus driving immune silencing for the entire microbial community. Hennezel et al. also reported that the abundance of several Bacteroidales species (Alistipes putredinis, Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$) show a moderate to strong correlation with the inhibition of IL-6 cytokine production, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production. Moreover, it appears that the total @sm$ LPS @/sm$ produced by the human gut microbiome not only is itself nonimmunogenic but also inhibits TLR4-dependent cytokine production.	1
Human Lactobacillus brevis and @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$ are also efficient @sm$ GABA @/sm$ producers, and have the potential to improve depression-like abnormalities.	1
ICE_2 carries tetM (@sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance) and can be found in a Hungatella hathewayi strain (Clostridia class of Firmicutes). Both ICEs can be transferred into a streptomycin and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ sensitive E. faecalis strain (Bacilli class of Firmicutes) by dry patch conjugation, demonstrating their ability to mobilise across different classes at different frequencies (Fig. 3c, d). Based on earlier analysis of this study, ICE_2 is predicted to be able to mobilise across phyla as well. We further selected a plasmid PLASMID_1 which carries a poorly characterised @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistant determinant and can be found in a @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ strain (Lachnospiraceae family of Firmicutes). Using filter and dry patch conjugations respectively, ICE_2 and PLASMID_1 were transferred into a @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ sensitive Klebsiella oxytoca strain (Enterobacteriaceae family of Proteobacteria) (Fig. 3c, e). Additionally, ICE_2 can conjugate into another Enterobacteriaceae pathogen E. coli ETEC H10407 which is @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ sensitive (Fig. 3d). These results demonstrated that the ICE and plasmid still retain the ability to mobilise between different bacterial phyla. In all five pairs of conjugation assays, transfer of the MGE of interest into recipient bacterial strains was confirmed by PCR on all transconjugants (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 5) and long-read sequencing of some randomly selected transconjugants (Supplementary Data 5). Conjugation efficiency is expressed as frequency of antibiotic-resistant transconjugants as the rate of gaining resistance by natural mutation is significantly lower or even below detection limit (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, we noted that formerly @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ sensitive K.	4
IS and pCS are the products of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ and tyrosine metabolism by the gut bacteria, and their increase following vancomycin therapy in ESRD patients indicates the resilience of the taxa generating these toxins. Within a cohort of 1018 middle-aged women from TwinsUK, Blautia was the most common taxon associated with lower levels of indole-propionic acid (IPA), whereas a positive correlation was observed between IPA and @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$. IPA is a deamination product of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolism that has an important effect on host gut barrier function and antioxidant activity.	1
Immunoglobulin G was then eluted with 0.1 M @sm$ glycine @/sm$-0.5 M NaCl buffer (pH 2.5), followed by dialysis against 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The anti-CTLP IgG fraction did not react with @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$, an oral spirochete closely related to Td, in immunofluorescence and ELISA assays indicating high specificity of the antibody.	0
In 1968, the ability of @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ (formerly Allescheria boydii) to utilize n-alkanes (C-10; C-14; C-16 and C-18) and 1-alkenes (C-10:1; C-14:1 and C-16:1) as their only @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source was described. Subsequently, the ability of @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ strains isolated from oil-soaked soil in Canada to degrade linear aliphatic compounds was demonstrated. Similarly, S. apiospermum is capable of utilizing aromatic compounds (diaryl ester phenylbenzoate, phenol, p-cresol, p-tolylbenzoate, 4-chlorophenylbenzoate and toluene) as the sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source.	2
In 2010, Chanawanno and colleagues prepared other @sm$ quaternary ammonium compounds @/sm$ (QACs) with a stilbene scaffold. A collection of 20 pyridinium and quinolinium stilbene benzenesulfonates was designed, synthesised, and tested for the antibacterial effects on the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. aureus, B subtilis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, E. faecalis, and on the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa, @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$, and S.	3
In AD patients, cognitive function scores were negatively associated with abundance of Blautia hydrogenotrophica (Firmicutes), Anaerotruncus colihominis (Firmicutes), and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$ (Actinobacteria). In addition, microbial abundance in the sucrose and @sm$ S-Adenosyl-L-methionine @/sm$ (SAMe) metabolic pathways was more enriched in AD with MCI than AD with dementia and significantly associated with higher cognitive function scores.	0
In Asia-Africa, the prevalence of resistance of total and different subtypes to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ increased markedly, with a total prevalence of resistance up to 14 2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3 9-29 4], 22 6% (95% CI 4 8-48 6) and 6 2% (95% CI 3 8-9 1) during 2010-2012, respectively. By contrast, resistance rates to these TGCs in Europe-America remained relatively low--less than 1 0% during the 15 years. A noticeable finding was that certain countries both in Europe-America and Asia-Africa, had a rapid rising trend in the prevalence of resistance of @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$, which even outnumbered S. flexneri in some periods. Moreover, comparison between countries showed that currently the most serious problem concerning resistance to these TGCs appeared in Vietnam, especially for ceftriaxone, China, especially for cefotaxime and Iran, especially for @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$.	4
In Firmann et al.'s study the influence of quercetin on intestinal commensal bacteria such as Ruminococcus gauvreauii, @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$ and Enterococcus caccae, was evaluated. Outcome of studies show that quercetin does not influence the growth of Ruminococcus gauvreauii but mildly hinder the growth of @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$ and Enterococcus caccae. The study held by Duda-Chodak ascertained negative effect of aglycons (@sm$ naringenin @/sm$, hesperetin, quercetin, and catechin) and glycosides (naringin, hesperidin, and rutin) on intestinal microbiota represented by Bacteroides galacturonicus, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus caccae, @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$, Ruminococcus gauvreauii, and Escherichia coli. In this experiment, polyphenols in concentrations of 20, 100, and 250 mug/mL diluted in growth medium were used(for quercetin the concentrations were 4, 20, and 50 mug/mL). The examined aglycones presented inhibiting properties towards investigated bacteria (dependent on the concentration of the substance in microbiological medium) while glycosides did not exhibit any effect on intestinal microflora. Catechins did not affect the growth of microorganisms. Only the growth of @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ was slightly slowed down while the growth of E.	3
In January 2000 she was treated with steroid recycle and cyclosporine-@sm$ azathioprine @/sm$-prednisone reintroduction. Fever occurred after 2 months and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was diagnosed. Treatment with Ganciclovir was started with clinical remission. In November 2000 CMV infection recurred and blood cultures were positive for a bacterium that was identified as @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. Bacteremia frequently occurs in cancer patients. Bacteremia due to @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ are rare, occurring mainly in immunocompromised patients. @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ expresses a proteinaceous surface layer that confers serum resistance.	3
In ST, Flexilinea, Fibrobacter, Eubacterium oxidoreducens group, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ group, Lachnoclostridium 10, Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-008, Lachnospiraceae UCG-009, Roseburia, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Ethanoligenens, Ruminococcaceae UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae UCG-012, Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 and Ruminococcus 1 were all found to be strongly positively correlated with the metabolites propionate, isobutyrate, S-2-methylbutanoic acid, benzoic acid and @sm$ hydrocinnamic acid @/sm$, which were all positively correlated with 14 metabolic pathways associated with, for example, production of acetyl-CoA, glycolysis and sulfate reduction.	1
In a blind test, 344 samples representing 80 bacterial isolates were analyzed by the @gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$ species-specific polymerase chain reaction (BaSS PCR) assay for the identification and discrimination of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ field strains (wild-type biovars 1, 2, and 4) from 1) @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ vaccine strains, 2) other Brucella species, and 3) non-Brucella bacteria. Identical samples were tested in 2 laboratories. Half the samples were fully viable, and half were bacteria that had been killed by @sm$ methanol @/sm$ fixation. The results in 1 laboratory correctly identified 100% of the samples, resulting in a predictive value of 100% for all categories and 100% sensitivity and specificity under the prescribed conditions. The second laboratory misidentified 31 samples, resulting in a range of 66.7-100% sensitivity, 93.2-99.7% specificity, and 77.3-98.2% predictive values depending on the category. There was no significant difference in viable versus fixed bacteria for either laboratory. Subsequent review of the protocol indicated that contamination was the likely cause of 26 of the 31 erroneous identifications. The results show that the BaSS PCR assay has the potential to be a very reliable screening tool for @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ identification.	3
In a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, an intervention consisting of chlorhexidine and @sm$ cetylpyridinium chloride @/sm$ mouthwash reduced dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and counts of F nucleatum and @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ in 3 months among individuals with moderate to severe periodontitis who were unable to maintain good oral hygiene. A Cochrane review of RCTs evaluating chlorhexidine mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene found that chlorhexidine use was associated with less dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and gingival inflammation over 4 to 6 weeks among individuals with periodontal disease. In a crossover trial, chlorhexidine mouthwash increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (associated with good oral health) and reduced content of Bacteroidetes, Saccharibacteria, SR1, and Fusobacteria (associated with poor oral health) among individuals without periodontal disease. @sm$ Cetylpyridinium chloride @/sm$ mouthwash without mechanical oral hygiene reduced preterm birth in pregnant individuals with periodontal disease who were at high risk of preterm birth, and it reduced risk of premature rupture of membranes without affecting preterm birth in another RCT.	3
In a previous clinical study, @sm$ lactulose @/sm$ ingestion was shown to increase the abundance of four Bifidobacterium taxa in the faeces of forty-nine females: @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ group, B. longum group, B. adolescentis and B. breve. We, therefore, examined the growth of 14 strains belonging to 13 different Bifidobacterium species/subspecies on mMRS-L. Among the tested strains, ten belonging to human residential Bifidobacterium (HRB) species/subspecies, which include the four strains mentioned above, showed marked growth (Fig. 3). Interestingly, B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM 10140, which harbours Bal6GBP, an SBP with low affinity to @sm$ lactulose @/sm$ (Kd = 4.9 x 102 muM), did not grow on @sm$ lactulose @/sm$. We then performed a BLASTP search against the genomes of the @sm$ lactulose @/sm$-assimilating strains to investigate whether the BL105A_0502 homologue (hereafter referred to as LT-SBP) was conserved. As expected, LT-SBP homologues were distributed in all of the @sm$ lactulose @/sm$-assimilating strains (Supplementary Fig.	2
In a recent interventional study, using different techniques, significant changes were observed in the fecal microbiota of healthy individuals undergoing smoking cessation, including an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes (@gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (high @sm$ guanine @/sm$ and cytosine content bacteria and Bifidobacteria) and a reduction of Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp.	0
In a recent study where @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ was found to be associated with increased insulin resistance, the abundance of 13 genera was also significantly associated with plasma @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ levels, including Bilophila and 2 genera from the Ruminococcaceae family. In the present study, Bilophila wadsworthia and @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ from the Ruminococcaceae family were positively associated with both plasma @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ and LBP levels. The abundance of Bi. wadsworthia, which is a sulfite-reducing bacterium, was proved to be increased by the consumption of animal products. Interestingly, the ability of the microbiota to synthesize TMA from phospholipids containing choline and L-carnitine depends on long-term dietary habits. Therefore, the differences observed between subjects with increased or decreased plasma @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ in pre- versus post-Rb consumption may be the result of pre-existing differences in gut microbial abundance as well as differences in consumption of meat products, although the latter differences were not observed in the present study.	1
In a similar study by a different group, using 105 8-week old pigs, it was found that vaccination of pigs against erysipelas in the presence of antibiotics may result in a decrease (ceftiofur, doxycycline, tiamulin) or enhancement (amoxillin, tulathromycin) in the production of specific antibodies against @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp.. In contrast, the use of ginseng as a co-adjuvant has been shown to improve the antibody response of vaccination. Ginseng contains immunomodulators named ginsenosides, which in pigs enhance the antibody response to viral and bacterial antigens found in vaccines. Two different erysipelas bacterins were tested and the addition of ginseng improved the less immunogenic vaccine so that it became more immunogenic compared to the vaccine without ginseng. The authors concluded that the use of ginseng as a co-adjuvant provides a simple, safe and inexpensive alternative for improving the potency of @sm$ aluminum hydroxide @/sm$ adjuvanted vaccines. Vaccination against other pathogens has not been shown to affect the efficacy of erysipelas vaccines. When pigs were vaccinated with an attenuated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine and later with an attenuated erysipelas vaccine followed by erysipelas challenge, a negative impact of PRRSV vaccine on the erysipelas vaccination was ruled out. Besides their usage in farmed animals, @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp. vaccines are occasionally used off-label in other species, including marine mammals, with encouraging results. Marine mammals are highly susceptible to @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp. infections, the disease course is almost always acute and is commonly fatal. Protection against @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp.	3
In a six-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY), 7.2 ml of a river water sample was added to 0.8 ml 10x ABB (Anaerobe Basal Broth, Oxoid [Remel], Lenexa, KS) + 10 x Preston supplement (@sm$ amphotericin B @/sm$ [10 mug/ml], rifampicin [10 mug/ml], trimethoprim lactate [10 mug/ml], and polymyxin B [5 UI/ml]; Oxoid) to achieve a final 1 x ABB + Preston concentration. These six-well plates were placed inside a plastic zip-loc bag containing 1-2% O2 + Bioblend gas (10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2; Praxair, Danbury, CT) and incubated for 24 h at 37  C and 40 rpm. For each enriched sample, a 10-mul loop was struck onto an ABA (Anaerobe Basal Agar) plate (Oxoid) amended with 5% laked horse blood (Hema) and CAT supplement (cefoperazone [8 mug/ml], @sm$ amphotericin B @/sm$ [10 mug/ml], and teicoplanin [4 mug/ml]; Oxoid). Plates were incubated in a microaerobic gas jar (AnaeroJar 3.5 L System; Oxoid) at 37  C under 1-2% O2 + Bioblend gas for 24-48 h. All positive cultures were examined under a 1,000 x microscope. Cultures positive for @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ were then filtered through a 0.6 -mu mixed cellulose filter onto an ABA plate.	3
In a study of the gut microbiota of deer it was recognized that @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ played a role in degrading tannins ingested by the host animal, and many of the @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ detected in the kakapo clone libraries were closely related to this species (Fig. 3, Streptococcus gallolyticus sub. macedonicus, AB563237). Most of the bacterial genera detected throughout the kakapo GIT are known anaerobic fermenters, capable of converting sugars such as glucose and @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ into acids such as acetate, which are utilized by the host. Members of the genus Clostridium are frequently identified as cellulolytic, and have been found to increase in proportion within the herbivore gut in the absence of starch. The inability to detect Bacteroidetes in a parrot, using either 16 S rRNA-based techniques or cultivation, is not unique to our study. In addition to playing roles in butyrate production and bile acid metabolism, Bacteroidetes are well-characterized degraders of starch and @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ in the gut.	2
In accordance with our previous findings, we found that RA patients had altered levels of @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ among other Actinobacteria. Species of the genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ have been demonstrated to modify host levels of bile acids and plasma cholesterol by producing various beneficial short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric acid, @sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, formic acid, and lactic acid. Chen et al. reported that the relative abundance of @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$ is higher in RA patients. However, as the genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ consists of nine diverse species, species-specific or strain-specific effects are possible. Members of Actinobacteria, and the genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ in particular, seem to be enriched in the gut microbiota of RA patients.	1
In addition to both of these enzymes, Schoefer and co-workers identified a hydrolase encoded by @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ involved in the metabolism of flavonoids. Enzymatic cleavage of C-C bonds in flavonoids appears to be characteristic of gut microbiota and can take place in the heterocyclic C-ring of flavonols, @sm$ flavones @/sm$, flavanones, and anthocyanidins, as well as in the aromatic ring A of flavanols. This enzyme called phloretin hydrolase can cleave the C-C ring of several dihydrochalcones including phloretin, thereby producing phenolic acids. However, our results show no detectable formation of hydroxyphenylacetic and hydroxyphenylpropionic acids from C-ring cleavage of the prenylated flavonoids by @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$.	1
In addition to calcium and vitamin D, other constituents in dairy products have antineoplastic activity, including conjugated linoleic acid, lactose, butyrate, and @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$-producing bacteria. A recent intervention study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed that consumption of a fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis potentiated colonic production of SCFAs and decreased abundance of @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, a pathobiont that has been linked to inflammation and colorectal cancer, suggesting the influence on the gut microbial composition and function of the microbes and other compounds in dairy.	1
In addition to these two genes, we also found the following genes: mltB, which is part of a network connecting resistance, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and fitness in @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$; fliL, encoding for the flagellar protein FliL; oprM, as part of the intergenic hits, described as a component of an efflux pump in Pseudomonas aeruginosa potentially involved in resistance to puromycin, @sm$ acriflavine @/sm$, and tetraphenylarsonium chloride (S9 Table).	4
In addition to this, it was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of the LPS core molecule in @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$. Here, the pgm mutant also lacked the O-antigen, but its LPS migrated lower on @sm$ SDS @/sm$ PAGE gels suggesting a core defect (Figure 4).	3
In addition to untreated growth controls in MHB, the following non-specific CM-active 'detergent' controls were used in these killing assays: @sm$ sodium dodecyl sulfate @/sm$ (@sm$ SDS @/sm$ (10% wt/vol; Ambion)) and 70% ethanol (ETOH). Pilot studies confirmed these latter two agents were rapidly bactericidal against this @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$-oralis strain-pair (data not shown).	3
In addition, by calculating functional annotations on @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, which was the most abundant type of Oscillospiraceae, we found that it had the potential to synthesize @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$ and degrade benzoic acid, which had a significant positive correlation with ruminants' resistance to parasitic infections (p < 0.05).	1
In addition, hindlimb unloading increased the proportion of @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ in Spirochaetes phylum, while decreased that of Ruminococcaceae unclassified, SMB53 and Allobaculum in Firmicutes phylum. Increased gut permeability has been shown to be associated with dysbiosis, such as a drastic decrease in abundance of Ruminoccoccaceae family (Ruminococcus and Oscillibacter) in alcohol-dependent subjects, or a decrease in Firmicutes but an increase in Bacteroidetes in mice with chronic @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ administration. reported that the improved expression of VE-cadherin is associated with high level of SMB53 genus in ileum of neonatal porcine model with breastfeeding. At the species level, the investigation has proved the increase of Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. in intestinal mucosa with Ulcerative Colitis compared with healthy control subjects. S. termitidis and Clostridium spp. were decreased in gut microbiota from children with celiac disease with reduction of ZO-1 expression. In addition, Bacteroides ssp., Prevotella ssp. and @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ ssp.	3
In addition, in one of our recent studies, we found that @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and other unclassified bacteria (Ruminococcaceae family) could protect from cardiovascular diseases in obese Qatari subjects, whereas species from the genus of L-Ruminococcus such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus torques did not involve in the protection from CVD. Furthermore, a study conducted by Singh et al. reported that @sm$ vitamin D @/sm$ supplementation in the healthy Qatari subjects showed a greater increase in the abundance of Ruminococcus bromii.	3
In addition, pathways for anaerobic unsaturated and saturated fatty acid synthesis (gondoate biosynthesis, cis-vaccenate biosynthesis) and hydrogen sulfide and @sm$ sulfate @/sm$ metabolism (@sm$ sulfate @/sm$ reduction I, @sm$ sulfate @/sm$ assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis, L-methionine biosynthesis) were significantly increased in abundance for patient eye samples, with contributions from Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae groups, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, and Oscillospiraceae groups.	2
In additional experiments, an anaerobic cellulolytic bacterial strain (@gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ sp. nov., strain designated 18P13(T)) was isolated from a human faecal sample (Chassard et al., 2012). In in vitro experiments, this strain was able to degrade @sm$ microcrystalline cellulose @/sm$ (@sm$ Avicel  PH-101 @/sm$), but the utilisation of soluble sugars was restricted to cellobiose.	2
In agreement with our results, the simultaneous employ of lactobacillus and prebiotics such as @sm$ pectin @/sm$ + L. plantarum, oyster mushroom + L. plantarum, galactooligosaccharide + L. plantarum in L. vannamei elevated growth indices and feed utilization in L. vannamei. These protective effects on host growth can be linked with releasing endogenous enzyme, producing metabolites from the fermentation process (vitamins, SCFs), and improving gut epithelial cells, which in turn facilitate the digestibility and absorption of nutrients. Other studies proposed that the beneficial effects of synbiotics are related to the ability of prebiotics in enhancing the colonization of favorable bacteria. During the recent decade, several researchers have confirmed the role of synbiotics on microbiota in crustaceans. For example, Safari et al. and Safari and Paolucci indicated the modulating effects of Enterococcus faecalis + xylooligosaccharide, @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ + mannanoligosaccharide, and E. faecalis + galactooligosaccharide on the gut microbiota of crayfish. These results are consistent with the findings of our study that in the presence of @sm$ pectin @/sm$, the rate of LAB colonization increased in the gut. The study implied that LS could use from @sm$ pectin @/sm$ as a carbon source during the fermentation process, a hypothesis previously confirmed by Kuo et al.	2
In agreement with the above findings, the @sm$ GABA @/sm$ precursors pyroglutamic acid and glutamate acid were enriched after anesthesia/surgery (Strandwitz et al.,), implying that elevated levels of @sm$ GABA @/sm$ precursors might be induced by enriched @gm$ Escherichia @/gm$-Shigella.	1
In analysis of each individual bacterial taxa with prenatal @sm$ Pb @/sm$ exposure (Figure 3), we found six taxa (Alistipes putredinis, Ruminococcus ghavus, Bacteroides caccae, B. intestinalis, Coprococcus catus, and @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$) to be negatively associated, and one (B. coprocola) to be positively associated with second trimester exposure. With third trimester exposure, we found three taxa (Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, and @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$) to be negatively associated, and three taxa (B. coprocola, Eubacterium eligens, and B. finegoldii) to be positively associated with @sm$ Pb @/sm$.	3
In another recent study, two key gut microbiota (KGM; Odoribacter splanchnicus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$) and five key serum metabolites (KSM; ouabain, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, @sm$ glycochenodeoxycholate @/sm$, theophylline, and xanthine) were found to be associated with HCC compared to non-HCC patients.	0
In another study, the 4-hydroxybutyric acid was first produced from @sm$ 1, 4-butanediol @/sm$ by a recombinant @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ strain harbouring dhaT and aldD (encoding 1, 3-propanediol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively) from Pseudomonas putida KT2442. Then the 4HB-containing fermentation broth was used to synthesize P4HB in the recombinant E. coli. dhaT and aldD from P. putida KT2442, orfZ from C. kluyveri, and phaC1 from C. necator were simultaneously expressed in E. coli. The resultant recombinant strain produced 2 g/L CDW containing 83 wt% of P(4HB) when using glucose and the 4-hydroxybutyric acid as the carbon source. The presence of dhaT and aldD in E. coli helped in converting any residual @sm$ 1,4-butanediol @/sm$ to 4HB, thus, increasing the supply of 4HB for P4HB synthesis.	1
In bacteria, these transport systems allow rapid access of urease to its substrate, resulting in ammonia production, which is needed either for resistance to acidity or as a @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ source. In @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, a ureolytic enteropathogenic bacterium, a gene of unknown function (yut) located near the urease locus was found to encode a putative membrane protein with weak homology to single-component eukaryotic urea transporters. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, Yut greatly increases cellular permeability to urea. Inactivation of yut in @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ results in diminished apparent urease activity and reduced resistance to acidity in vitro when urea is present in the medium. In the mouse model, bacterial colonization of the intestine mucosa is delayed with the Yut-deficient mutant. Although structurally unrelated, Yut and the Helicobacter pylori UreI urea channel were shown to be functionally interchangeable in vitro and are sufficient to allow urea uptake in both bacteria, thereby confirming their function in the respective parent organisms. Homologues of Yut were found in other yersiniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Brucella melitensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ Yut protein is therefore the first member of a novel class of bacterial urea permeases related to eukaryotic transporters.	2
In clinical important pathogenic bacteria, fosfomycin resistance involves metalloenzymes that catalyze the opening of the epoxide (oxirane) ring by adding @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ (FosA1-FosA10, FosL1-2, FosC2), bacillithiol (FosB), or water (FosX) (Rigsby et al., 2005). FosB (Mg2+-cofactor) type enzymes are found in low GC Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis,B. anthracis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. aureus. FosX (Mn2+-cofactor) has been described in Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes,@gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, and Brucella melitensis (Silver, 2017).	4
In conclusion, @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ is a rare organism that is causative of infective endocarditis. @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ bacteremia/septicemia is coincidental with infective endocarditis in up to 90 percent of its patients, as per prior studies. This case report draws attention to @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ bacteremia in a patient with hepatic dysfunction due to alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis). Chronic alcoholism is a known risk factor for E. rhusiopathiae infection. There are very few studies and cases reported that present @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ bacteremia without endocarditis in immunocompetent patients who have @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ related hepatic damage.	3
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the alpha-MG and @sm$ LME @/sm$ in the tooth gel synergistically increased its antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$, and C. albicans and antibiofilm formation effect. The fluoride tooth gel containing alpha-MG plus @sm$ LME @/sm$ affected the morphology of these microbes.	3
In conclusion, this study identified gastric pathogenic microbes that are associated with persistent inflammation (@gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$, S. anginosus and Ralstonia) and atrophy/IM (Granulicatella, Actinomyces, Rothia, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Abiotrophia and Parvimonas) in patients 1 year following H. pylori eradication, which are predominantly oral microbes and form a distinct cluster in the microbial ecology in the absence of H. pylori. In keeping with the pathogenic ecology, functional pathways including amino acid metabolism and @sm$ inositol phosphate @/sm$ metabolism were enriched while folate biosynthesis and NOD-like receptor signalling decreased in atrophy/IM-associated gastric microbiota.	0
In contrast to @gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$, growth of Veillonella does not require hemin and menadione, and flourescence is rapidly lost upon exposure to air. The fluorescent component of a strain of V. parvula examined could not be extracted in solution with water, ether, methanol, or chloroform, but was readily extracted with 0.4 N @sm$ NaOH @/sm$.	3
"In contrast to the CUMS rats, we found that the administration of fluoxetine hydrochloride led to higher propionic acid; the administration of @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ led to higher isovaleric acid; the administration of B. uniformis led to higher butyrate, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid. In previous animal experiments, we found that administering F. prausnitzii led to higher acetic acid, propionic acid, and @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$. These potential psychobiotics may produce short-chain fatty acids, which agrees with the functional mechanism of these potential psychobiotics on mood found in the ""Lunar Palace 365"" experiment based on multiomics analysis. The results of metabolite analysis showed that administering @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ led to higher GABA, DL-Kynurenine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan and led to lower picolinic acid and 5-HIAA; the administration of B."	1
In contrast, a few bacteria such as @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium of intestinal microbiota have the competence to reduce ACE2 expression in the gut epithelial cells, thereby influencing the calibrated immune system to encumber the pathogenicity of COVID-19. These commensal bacteria sustain the nutritional factors in gut. It is cardinal for enhancing the immune system and essential for the protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, @sm$ acetate @/sm$) are synthesized by @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii and a Lachnospiraceae bacterium; an abundance of these bacteria is imperative for providing prophylactic efficacy against COVID-19.	1
In contrast, addition of 20 mM glucose resulted in a disappearance of neohesperidine dihydrochalcone and the appearance of hesperetin dihydrochalcone, @sm$ 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid @/sm$ and 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid in incubations within 22 h with all four faecal slurries. Using the complex medium, the time required for complete neohesperidine dihydrochalcone degradation ranged from 44 to more than 142 h. An additional transient metabolite - hesperetin dihydrochalcone 4'-beta-d-glucoside - was also identified. The demethylation of 3-(3-hydroxy- 4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid was observed in some of the fermentation experiments, giving rise to @sm$ 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid @/sm$. Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone was also incubated at a concentration of 0.52 mM in complex medium with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract species @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$ or Clostridium orbiscindens. Neither of the strains converted neohesperidine dihydrochalcone within 43 h of incubation. However, @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ completely converted hesperetin dihydrochalcone 4'-beta-d-glucoside within 18 h of incubation to an equimolar amount of 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid. The aglycon hesperetin dihydrochalcone was transiently formed, reaching a maximum concentration after 4 h of fermentation. When hesperetin dihydrochalcone was used in fermentation experiments, @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ cleaved the compound within 1 h to yield 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid.	1
In contrast, beneficial bacteria, such as Fecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Eubacterium rectole, Ruminococcus obeum , and @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ , were greatly reduced in these cases. The researchers further concluded that there were microbiome profiles correlated with worse COVID-19 symptoms: bacteria of the genus Coprobacillus , known to increase ACE 2 expression in mice gut, Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium hathewayi . Alistipes onderdonkii , which is involved in the tryptophan-@sm$ serotonin @/sm$ metabolism, is essential for gut homeostasis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii produces butyrate, being associated with a better prognosis.	0
In contrast, individuals without obesity (BMI < 30 kg m-2) have a higher abundance of Alistipes shahii, @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$, Lachnospiraceae sp. 8_157FAA, and Bacteroidales sp. ph8. It was proposed that some of these bacteria may play a role in L-histidine biosynthesis, @sm$ L-lysin @/sm$ biosynthesis, and galactose degradation, for which these metabolic processes were positively correlated with obesity. For instance, the study found that C. aerofaciens and S. thermophilus were strongly correlated to the histidine biosynthesis pathway. The gut microbiome between individuals with intermediate BMI between 28-35 kg m-2 and those with high BMI > 35 kg m-2 was also further examined. Results established that the six most predictive species of intestinal microbiota in individuals with severe obesity include Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Granulicatella unclassified, Lactococcus lactis, and Collisella aerofaciens. Overall, the obesity group has a higher abundance of Firmicutes (Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Dorea formicigenerans) and a diminished abundance of Bacteroidetes (Alistipes shahii and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$) (Table 1).	0
In contrast, non-or moderate-acetogens and hydrogen-producing bacteria, such as @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ spp., Odoribacter spp. and Coprococcus spp. were found in samples from MCC-fed mice. This further confirmed that the increase of SRB in mice from groups M and GM might probably be associated with the production of H2 during the fermentation of MCC. In addition, bacteria with strong fiber-degradation capability, such as bacteria in the family Ruminoccaceae, which are well known to degrade SDF, but also IDF, with their multiple @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ active enzymes (CAZy), were found in samples from mice fed with glucan and MCC-mixture.	2
In contrast, the abundances of Bacteroides ovatus, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, and Parasutterella excremntihominis in the gut microbiome and the abundances of Gemella haemolysans in the oral microbiome were significantly negatively correlated (Fig 6C and D, Datasets [Link], [Link], [Link]). We also found that the abundances of the Fusobacterium periodonticum and Porphyromonas somerae, opportunistic pathogens in the oral microbiome, were significantly positively correlated to the urea levels (Fig EV2A). Interestingly, @sm$ creatinine @/sm$ levels correlated with increased abundances of Prevotella copri and Neisseria flavescens and decreased abundances of Prevotella nigrescens and Veilonella parvula in the oral microbiome (Fig 6D, Dataset EV18). The abundances of Bacteroides fragilis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the gut microbiome are negatively correlated with @sm$ creatinine @/sm$ levels (Fig 6C, Dataset EV17).	3
In cross-country runners, the effect of 10 weeks of protein supplementation (10 g whey isolate and 10 g beef hydrolysate per day) consumed daily decreased SCFA-producing bacteria while increasing bacteria with proteolytic activity in the microbiota without affecting SCFAs, @sm$ ammonia @/sm$, or fecal pH of endurance athletes. The amount of additional dietary protein was small but yielded a significant 17% increase in dietary protein for these athletes. Specifically, protein supplementation increased the abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum and decreased the presence of health-related taxa including @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Blautia, and B.	2
In general, de novo folate biosynthesis requires the precursors of both DHPPP and @sm$ pABA @/sm$. Upon analyzing the genomes, it was found that most species carry the pabA gene, which encodes aminodeoxychorismate synthase for @sm$ pABA @/sm$ biosynthesis. However, only B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. breve and B. dentium that are typically found in humans, B. aesculapii, B. callithricos, B. callithrichidarum, B. goeldii, B. myosotis, @gm$ B. moukalabense @/gm$, B. parmae and B. stellenboschense from non-human primates and B. ruminantium, B. porcinum, B. rousetti and B. subtile from other animals have the pabC gene, that encodes the 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase and are considered able to complete the @sm$ pABA @/sm$ biosynthesis process [Figure 4 and ].	1
In general, disease-associated species appear to decrease when adding @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ (50 mM > 5 mM) or @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ combined with the Ra9 strain. Treatment using 5 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ (Fig. 3B) resulted in a decreased abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema maltophilum, and an unassigned Streptococcus sp., compared to controls. The 10-fold higher 50 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ treatment (Fig. 4B) increased the relative abundance of a Rothia sp. as well as an Aggregatibacter sp. (other than the known disease-associated species Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is detected separately and does not change significantly) and a Neisseria sp., whereas 25 species decreased in abundance, including multiple species of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, among others (all p < 0.05). Specifically, in samples treated with 50 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$, the classified species that decreased significantly were Capnocytophaga leadbetteri, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella oris, Leptotrichia wadei, Granulicatella elegans, Dialister invisus, @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$, Alloprevotella tannerae, Eikenella corrodens, Filifactor alocis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas pasteri. The addition of the probiotic candidate Ra9 in samples treated with 5 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ (Fig. 5B) also resulted in a significant increase of a Rothia sp. (though not classified, this is likely to correspond to Rothia aeria, resulting from the added Ra9 strain). Rothia mucilaginosa, a species that increased in samples treated with 50 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$, decreased in samples treated with both 5 mM @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ and the probiotic (p < 0.05), possibly resulting from nutrient and niche competition with Rothia aeria.	3
In general, the family of beta-agonists, including ractopamine, cimaterol, @sm$ clenbuterol @/sm$, and salbutamol, is used to improve the carcass leanness in livestock species. The scientific reports reveal that such beta-agonists cause several potential hazardous effects such as cardiac palpitation, nervousness, tachycardia, muscle tremors, and confusion. Bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella (31%), Listeria (28%), @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ (5%), and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (3%) species are the causative agents of microbial contamination.	0
In ground beef, Moringa oleifera leaf extracts had an inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella flexinerii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the extracts of cadillo leaves (Bidens pilosa) effectively inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus fecali, Escherichia coli, and Shigella flexinerii. The phenolic compounds (gallic acid, caftaric acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and @sm$ caffeic acid @/sm$) present in the extracts obtained from Bidens pilosa are closely related to their antimicrobial effects.	3
In line with previous observations in which @sm$ iron @/sm$-deficient environments led to increased species of the Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae families, higher SF levels were associated with a decrease in species belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum (Klebsiella pneumoniae, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Unclassified Escherichia).	0
In many bacterial genera, this Kdo unit is then extended by a lateral alpha-(2   4)-linked Kdo moiety and further elongated at position 5 by additional inner core sugars such as l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (l,d-Hep), d-glucose, d-galacturonic acid or @sm$ d-mannose @/sm$. Specifically, 5-O-mannosylated Kdo has been found in bacteria such as Francisella tularensis, @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobiaceae. In the latter strains, defects in the mannosyl transferase LpsC impairs their nodulation activity. Recently, the structure of an oligomannose linked to O-5 of Kdo was reported for the inner core of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Rhizobium radiobacter Rv3, also termed Agrobacterium radiobacter and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Figure 1). Of note is the structural resemblance of the alpha-(1   2)-linked oligomannose part to the D1 arm of mammalian high-mannose glycans, which are particularly abundant on HIV-1 gp120.Rhizobium radiobacter Rv3 LOS and heat-killed cells are bound by the oligomannose-specific HIV-neutralizing antibody 2G12 and a crystal structure of the carbohydrate backbone of Rhizobium radiobacter strain Rv3 complexed to the 2G12 antibody has recently been determined. In order to further exploit the natural mimicry of high-@sm$ mannose @/sm$ carbohydrate epitopes of HIV-1 gp120 seen with this bacterial LOS scaffold, we have set out to extend the bacterial oligosaccharides in order to elicit HIV neutralizing antibodies. In a first step we have prepared the basic branched core oligosaccharide in a sufficient scale to allow for regioselective mannosylation at O-3 and O-6 of the central @sm$ mannose @/sm$ unit, respectively, as well as for global deprotection to give the pentasaccharide core fragment equipped with a functional spacer group to allow for conversion into neoglycoconjugates.	1
In one case microporous polycarbonate membrane was modified using polypyrrole modification to create conductive membranes in order to detect @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-infecting phage. In another case cellulose acetate (CA) membranes were grafted with hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The hydroxypropyl cellulose was first crosslinked using @sm$ divinyl sulfone @/sm$ (@sm$ DVS @/sm$) to form branching structures. The cellulose acetate was then reacted with the @sm$ DVS @/sm$ and then the HPC was grafted onto the CA.	0
In order to compare the use of both processes in two different reactor configurations, batch reactors and continuous anaerobic fluidized bed reactors (AFBR) were studied under the same conditions (37 C, pH 6.8, @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ as an inoculum and glucose as a substrate) to evaluate the influence of zero valence iron and nickel nanoparticles (NPs) on H2 and VFA production. There was a shift in the production of acetic and butyric acids to produce mainly @sm$ valeric acid @/sm$ when NPs were added in batch reactors.	1
In order to further evaluate the importance of the bifidobacterial contribution to degradation of complex @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ found in the human gut, we compared the bifidobacterial GH repertoire with all the so far sequenced members of the human gut microbiome. For this purpose, we used GH data of 2,674 genomes available in the CAZy database with the addition of data obtained from the bifidobacterial genomes analysed in this study. Interestingly, the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus was shown to specify one of the largest arsenal of GH13, GH43, GH3 and GH51 family members (2.0 fold-, 2.6 fold-, 5.8 fold-, 7.0 fold-, respectively, more with respect to the average GH arsenal of the gut microbiome), along with Bacteroides spp.	2
In order to test the hypothesis that @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ was capable of reintroducing U. maydis, several methods have been tried. We cocultured a GFP-labeled @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ and U. maydis for 72 h, and also cocultured @sm$ MgCl2 @/sm$ treated fungi and EHB on plates, but the results were not satisfactory (Spraker et al.; Arendt et al.).	0
In our experiment, metabolomics revealed differences in the degradation of the studied drugs and suggested the links between the abundance of oligosaccharide compounds in the culture medium and changes in Bacteroidota abundance in response to @sm$ chlorpromazine @/sm$ treatment. However, since our flow injection approach enabled acquisition of only exact ion masses (MS1), our dataset contains many ambiguous ion annotations. Follow up studies collecting tandem mass spectra (MS1 and MS2) and using chemical standards are required to confirm the identities of the changing metabolites (Schymanski et al, ). Furthermore, our dataset contains only extracellular metabolite measurements, and thus only provides indirect information on intracellular functional changes in the bacterial community. Of the three drugs used for perturbation, only @sm$ chlorpromazine @/sm$ caused a large disturbance in the community composition. Surprisingly, metformin, which has been shown to alter the gut microbiome in patients (Forslund et al, ; Wu et al, ), did not perturb the community in our study, even though our earlier study suggested that the growth of at least four different species is inhibited by metformin at the concentration used in monocultures (F. nucleatum, B. longum, P. copri and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$; Maier et al, ).	3
In our previous work, seven potential FAE genes were identified from in vitro fermentation of human fecal slurry using metagenomic sequencing in which one FAE from @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ (AsFAE) was characterized. Here, a novel FAE from Dorea formicigenerans (DfFAE) of Firmicutes was bacterially expressed and purified to assess its enzymatical properties. DfFAE belongs to type-A FAE and has a higher preference for hydrolyzing short-chain ester substrate (@sm$ p-nitrophenyl acetate @/sm$, pNPA), which shows superior catalytic activity than AsFAE.	1
In our study, the steroid hormones such as @sm$ ethinyl estradiol @/sm$ and progesterone significantly increased the growth of B. fragilis, E. coli, and L. reuteri whereas decreasing the growth of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$. Conversely, previous studies reported the antibacterial effect of steroid derivatives by preventing the normal development of the cell membrane integrity and permeability. Thus, it is thought that the reason for the antibacterial effect of steroid bile acids is due to their binding to phospholipids in bacterial membranes resulting in membrane destruction and ultimately cell death. The resistance of the selected gut bacteria to the deleterious effect of steroids could be due to the presence of bile salt hydrolase enzyme in these genera which protect them from the damaging effect of steroid bile acids. Another explanation for the resistance of L. reuteri to bile salts was the protective effect of this bacteria against steroids as bile acids arising from precipitation of the deconjugated bile salts and physical binding of bile salts by a bacterium, so rendering the detrimental bile salts accessible. The increase in growth of B. fragilis could be explained by the study carried out by using labeled C14 steroid hormones who proved the uptake of these hormones by Bacteroides bacteria and explained their ability to substitute vitamin K compounds, an essential growth factor, with progesterone and @sm$ ethinyl estradiol @/sm$ resulting in an increased growth curve. Both steroid hormones had a significant effect in reducing the growth of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ in this study supported by findings of previous studies on Gram-positive bacteria, which demonstrated that different steroids reduce in vitro growth and increase cell leakage. @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ growth was reduced under the same treatment which could be attributed to their lower resistance to bile acids compared to other @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species.	3
In our study, we showed that the prevalence of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ resistance to AZM, CLR, LVFX, SPFX, MTZ, and TID was high, whereas the prevalence of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ resistance to AMX, AMC, @sm$ CFM @/sm$, TET, DOX, RFP, and FZD was relatively low in Fujian, China. Clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin are the most commonly used antibiotics for @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ treatment; thus, their resistance has been widely studied. In our study, the resistance rates to the three antibiotics were all >30%, similar to other regions of China, but higher than those in the Americas, Europe, and South-East Asia. CLR+MTZ, CLR+LVFX, and CLR+MTZ+LVFX were the main multiple resistance patterns; therefore, these three antibiotics should not be used simultaneously to treat @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$. Additionally, resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin have increased over time in all WHO regions. This may be due to macrolide and quinolone consumption for other infections in the community. found a significant association between @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ resistance to clarithromycin and community consumption of macrolides, and between @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ resistance to levofloxacin and consumption of quinolones and second-generation quinolones.	4
In particular, by comparing top 80 OTUs presented in N and L2-treated groups, several species or OTUs, including species of Bacteroides acidifaciens and genus of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, were found to be significantly increased after L2 treatment. The more abundant Bacteroides acidifaciens and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ might be linked to L2 degradation in mouse intestine. Such as, Alistipes putredinis can degrade fiber and glucosinolates. @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ were suggested to be involved in the metabolism of @sm$ glycans @/sm$. Different resources of non-digestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ have different chemical structure, which might influenced the profiles of populations and metabolites of bacteria groups. Hull-less barley cultivars, barley cultivars with hulls, oat cultivars, oat groats differed in beta-glucan, non-starch polysaccharide, and resistant starch have been used to explore their effects on microbial communities and SCFA profiles in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed a complex interactions between different @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and the intestinal bacteria, indicating that the glycosidic linkage type might influence the intestinal microbial communities and metabolites. The characteristics that some intestinal microbial groups might prefer to utilize specific @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and produce different metabolites profiles are of fundamental importance. Understanding the mechanism would provide opportunity for designing non-digestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ formula to manipulate the intestinal microbial communities and their metabolisms.	2
In particular, disorders of purine metabolism lead to increased levels of @sm$ uric acid @/sm$ in maternal blood. In the hindgut of pregnant goats, we detected a high abundance of adenine and purine metabolites, mainly deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyinosine, and 5'-deoxyadenosine, which were negatively correlated with the abundance of the genus Family_XIII_AD3011_group. Previous studies have shown that intestinal microbiota can be involved in purine metabolism in the body, and in patients with high uric acidity, the abundance of Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ was significantly increased, and the levels of Prevotella spp, Ruminococcus spp, and Lactobacillus spp were decreased. Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Pseudomonas can secrete xanthine dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the oxidative metabolism of purines, responsible for the conversion of xanthine into @sm$ uric acid @/sm$.	1
In particular, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and @sm$ dimethyl sulfide @/sm$ (C2H6S) are considered significant parameters and markers of halitosis. Some microorganisms such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ are involved in periodontal diseases and may also facilitate the production of VSC metabolism.	1
In particular, members of the genera @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus were observed to O-deglycosylate, e.g., flavanone and isoflavone glycosides. While O-deglycosylation was the most extensively described flavonoid deglycosylation, with many glycosides from flavonols (e.g., @sm$ rutin @/sm$ in several vegetables), flavanones (often found in citrus fruits) and isoflavones (present mainly in soy products) as substrates, several bacteria also mediate C-deglycosylation from compounds such as isovitexin, e.g., from buckwheat.	2
"In particular, some resident bacteria in the oral cavity are able to reduce the dietary intake of @sm$ nitrates @/sm$ , producing nitrites . Among these, Neisseria, Veillonella, @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, Brevibacillus, and Granulicatella are mainly involved in this process (Doel et al.,; Hyde et al.,). The main dietary source of @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ is represented by vegetables (Ysart et al.,). Once ingested, @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and enters in the bloodstream. Here, it mixes to the endogenous @sm$ nitrate @/sm$, which mainly derives from the L-arginine-NO pathway (Leaf et al.,). Most of the @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ is then excreted in the urine, while up to 25% of plasma @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ is taken up by the salivary glands and placed in the enterosalivary circulation (Spiegelhalder et al.,). Salivary @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ is metabolized to nitrite by oral commensal bacteria and it can be further reduced to nitric oxide (NO).  can be stored in blood and tissues and used when there is a decreased endogenous production of NO (Bryan and Loscalzo,). Consequently, NO may contribute to a myriad of biological processes, among which: immunitary defense, regulation of mucosal blood flow and mucus production, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, cerebral blood flow, glucose regulation, and mitochondrial function (Bryan and Loscalzo,). The above described processes are known as ""@sm$ nitrate @/sm$-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway"" (Zweier et al.,)."	1
In particular, the higher resistances were observed in two strains of @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:-, three strains of S. Brandenburg, and one strain of S. enterica subs. salamae that resulted resistant to seven antimicrobials (Table 3). Most of the resistances were observed against sulfadiazine + sulfamerazine + sulfamethazine; in fact 96% of the strains tested resulted resistant to these molecules. Less than the 1% of tested strains resulted resistant to chloramphenicol, colistin, ceftazidime, @sm$ enrofloxacin @/sm$, and nalidixic acid.	4
In particular, vancomycin use has been associated with a depletion of the relative abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing taxa, such as @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, along with a decrease in plasma butyrate concentration, which persisted at 2-month follow-up. Moreover, bacterial species such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis have recently been shown to be associated with ecological recovery after antibiotic therapy, as they were able to support (and boost) the repopulation of other gut species through specific @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-degradation and energy-production pathways.	2
In previous studies, free radical scavenging activity, chelating activity, inhibitory activity of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ peroxidation, and antioxidant-related enzyme activity were used to assess the antioxidant effects of LAB strains. Han et al. and Tang et al. presented that the antioxidant substances of LAB strains are NADH, NADPH, antioxidant enzymes, Mn2+, bioactive compounds, and exopolysaccharides. Das and Goyal found higher DPPH radical scavenging activity in L. plantarum DM5, L. plantarum B-4496, and L. acidophilus B-4495. Han et al. reported that intact cells of LAB strains containing @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ R1 and L. brevis R4 had significantly higher ABTS radical scavenging activity than cell-free extract and supernatant. Li et al. showed that the free radical scavenging ability of intact cells is related to the cell surface materials of bacteria, e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, and lipoteichoic acid. In addition, Tang et al. reported that the intact cells of L. plantarum MA2 prevented @sm$ lipid @/sm$ peroxidation.	3
In response to Cd treatment, the C content increased, and O, Mg, @sm$ Si @/sm$, S, P, and Ca levels decreased, while in the cell walls, only the S and Ca contents decreased. In the interior of the cells of Bacillus sp. ML1-2, larger changes in the elemental compositions of C, @sm$ Si @/sm$, P, and K were measured, while smaller changes in C and @sm$ Si @/sm$ contents were observed in the cell walls. In the cellular compartments of @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ and S. entomophila I-111-21, which did not accumulate Cd2+ at relevant levels, the changes in elemental composition were less significant than those in the other investigated strains. However, the same number of changes (4) was observed in the interior of the cells of S. entomophila I-111-21 as in Bacillus sp. ML1-2 and Pseudomonas sp. IV-111-14. The whole cell analyses revealed no differences in the number of elements that changed quantities (4) between Bacillus sp. ML1-2 and Pseudomonas sp. IV-111-14 or between Massilia sp. III-116-18 and @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ strains.	3
In response to low iron availability, @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ synthesizes and secretes a polyhydroxycarboxylate-type siderophore vibrioferrin which is composed of 1 mol each of 2-ketoglutaric acid, L-alanine, @sm$ ethanolamine @/sm$, and citric acid.	1
In saliva, there were statistically significant differences in beta diversity between HC and PA+P (p = 0.001), HC and @sm$ P @/sm$ (p = 0.001), and P and PA+P (p = 0.028). The microbial profiles of saliva and fecal samples were distinct. Mycoplasma faucium, Tannerella forsythia, Parvimonas micra, and Saccharibacteria (TM7) were increased in P; Prevotella pallens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Neisseria multispecies were more abundant in PA+P group, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Dialister succinatiphilus, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Alloprevotella tannerae were detected in fecal samples in P groups compared to healthy controls.	0
In several cases, the related strains were assigned the same phenotype (e.g., U2), yet were shown to possess different alpha-AOS utilization regulons (e.g., AauU2 in @gm$ B. stellenboschense @/gm$ and AauR in B. callitrichos) that included different @sm$ oligosaccharide @/sm$ uptake systems (AbfT2 and AauABC).	2
In silico analysis of the published @sm$ oligonucleotide @/sm$ sequences revealed mismatches and resulted in modified @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ for A. actinomycetemcomitans  and Archaea . Modifications are indicated in Table 1. Primer sets were evaluated empirically in PCR experiments applying DNA extracted from S. sanguinis DSM 20567, F. nucleatum DSM 15643, P. gingivalis DSM 20709, A. actinomycetemcomitans DSM 8324, @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ DSM 7256, T. denticola DSM 14222, F. naviforme DSM 20699 and F. necrophorum DSM 20698. Neither false-negative results nor cross-reactivity among the tested species were observed (data not shown). All designed and modified @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ showed no secondary structures when analyzed by the software OligoCalc and mfold and melting curve analysis demonstrated further the absence of any PCR artifact formation for each of the primer sets (data not shown).	0
In sum, the IspH inhibitor prodrugs had lower MIC90 against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$, A. baumanii, P. aeruginosa, V. cholerae and K. pneumoniae than the current best-in-class antibiotics like Meropenem (Carbapenems), Amikacin & Tobramycin (Aminoglycosides), Ciprofloxacin (Fluoroquinolones), @sm$ Ceftriaxone @/sm$, Cefepime and Ceftaroline (3rd, 4th and 5th generation Cephalosporins) (Fig.	3
In summary, the factors that influence the metabolic degradation of dietary @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ by the intestinal flora include two main points: the structure of the @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ and the type of microorganism. Taking the structure of @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ as an example, in vitro experiments revealed that the rate of freeing bound Ferulic acid in fermented wheat-bran dietary fibre was significantly lower than that of bound Ferulic acid in sugar beet fibre under the same conditions, mainly due to structural differences in the bound @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$. As an example, it has been shown that the metabolic phenotype of equol in humans is determined by the microbial composition of the gut, with equol producers having microorganisms such as Streptococcus intermedius, @gm$ Ruminococcus productus @/gm$ and Bacteroides ovatus in their gut, while the guts of non-equol-producers lack these bacteria.	2
In the CS the choline molecules are stabilized by cation-pi interactions with three structurally conserved aromatic residues (two tryptophan residues from a beta-hairpin and one @sm$ tyrosine @/sm$ residue from the next beta-hairpin) and by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with one methionine residue located at the bottom of the cavity (Fig. 3B). In the NCS the choline molecules are stabilized by cation-pi interactions with four aromatic residues. In this case, only one tryptophan residue is provided by the first beta-hairpin, two @sm$ tyrosine @/sm$ residues come from the second beta-hairpin (one of them from the turn of this beta-hairpin, Tyr140 in Fig. 3C) and the fourth aromatic residue (Tyr152 in Fig. 3@gm$ C) comes @/gm$ from the loop followed the beta-hairpin and replaces the methionine residue found in CS (Fig.	0
In the PT_G2 subgroup, which had a significantly higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids (including butyrate, acetate, @sm$ choline @/sm$ and propionate), Eubacterium nodatum, Dialister pneumosintes, Mogibacterium timidum, P. endodontalis, @gm$ P. dentalis @/gm$, T.	1
In the absence of EUCAST MIC breakpoint for @sm$ rifaximin @/sm$ against @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$, we chose the clinically meaningful concentration of 1000 mug/ml, which is 1/8 of the fecal concentration that is achieved after oral administration. At this concentration @sm$ rifaximin @/sm$ inhibited in vitro 84.8% of isolates. At this concentration, @sm$ rifaximin @/sm$ inhibited 84.0% and 86.9% of KPC and OXA-48-like producing isolates respectively (Table 1).	3
In the case of fatty acids, many @gm$ LAB @/gm$ can produce SCFA, especially @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate, with potential therapeutic effects on depression, autism, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, metabolites from the conversion of fatty acids by specific @gm$ LAB @/gm$ strains may contribute to the prolonged storage life of sourdough bread. demonstrated that Levilactobacillus hammesii converts linoleic acid to a monohydroxy octadecenoic acid, preventing fungal spoilage of bread without adversely impacting on the sensory properties. This conversion was observed in SD fermentation supplemented with linoleic acid as a substrate. These conversions from fatty acids have not been fully explored in SD. It remains unknown whether hydroxy fatty acids produced by @gm$ LAB @/gm$ could have a specific positive impact on health.	1
In the co-occurrence network, we found that the neighbors of Flavonifractor, such as Pseudoflavonifractor and @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$, were able to hydrolyze aesculin (similar to flavonoid glycosides in molecular structure) into @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and aesculetin.	1
In the current study we have, for the first time, employed RNA-sequencing to identify @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ regulated genes in an enteric pathogen. Our findings confirm previous results, but as this method is more sensitive than array based approaches, we identified an extended repertoire of genes modulated by @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ in an FNR-dependent or -independent manner. For instance, little is known about the role of Cra, a transcriptional regulator of carbon flux (that represses glycolysis and activates gluconeogenesis) here shown to be induced under anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, mutation of cra increases both epithelial cell attachment and invasion by @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ in aerobic conditions. However, Cra has an entirely distinct role in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a close relative of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$, when investigated under conditions mimicking the anaerobic environment of the intestinal tract.	3
In the current study we observed higher BMI was associated with lower level of two species from the family Rikenellaceae, Alistipes finegoldii, and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$, while blood lipids were associated with other two species, Alistipes shahii and Alistipes putredinis (table S11). Strikingly, these species were also associated to certain dietary factors and drugs. For instance, a high level of Alistipes shahii, which was associated to low @sm$ TG @/sm$ levels, was linked to higher fruit intake (q= 0.00027).	0
In the current study, PLS-DA analysis identified 7 compounds in colonic digesta as the most important factors for distinguishing the control and HC-fed goats: beta-alanine, threonic acid, p-cresol, stigmasterol, erythronic acid, @sm$ glycylproline @/sm$, and quinic acid. Beta-alanine, not a precursor for the biosynthesis of major proteins or enzymes, is normally metabolized into acetic acid. The concentration of beta-alanine was increased by the HC diet, which was consistent with the increase in the acetate level. Studies identified p-cresol as a toxin in the sheep urine (White et al.,) and as a metabolic troublemaker and a genotoxic agent toward colonocyte (Andriamihaja et al.,). Moreover, the production of p-cresol was shown to be associated with Lactobacillus sp. (Yokoyama and Carlson,). However, in the current study, the HC diet exerted no effect on the proportion of Lactobacillus in general, suggesting that bacteria species other than Lactobacilli were involved in p-cresol production. Indeed, our results showed that the p-cresol level was significantly correlated with the abundance of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ (negative correlation), Clostridium (positive correlation), and Prevotella (negative correlation). @sm$ Glycylproline @/sm$, a stable substrate for the di/tri/oligopeptide transport system, was used as an affinity probe (Moore et al.,). @sm$ Glycylproline @/sm$ significantly reduced the permeability of cefadroxil, a bactericidal antibiotic (Posada and Smith,). Correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between the level of @sm$ glycylproline @/sm$ and the density of Turicibacter (positive correlation) and Clostridium (positive correlation).	2
In the current study, malathion administration for 4 weeks induced modification in the composition of microflora, as there was drop in the abundance of Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Streptococcus spp., and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$. It is of note that these bacteria are populations of SCFA-producing microflora. In normal conditions, SCFA-producing bacteria prevent excessive growth of pH-sensitive pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridia. The Bacteroidetes phylum mainly produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and propionate, whereas the Firmicutes phylum has butyrate as its primary metabolic end product.	1
In the gut, phytoestrogens can be further processed to more active compounds, such as equol, @sm$ O-desmethylangolensin @/sm$, dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, enterolactone, and enterodiol. The enterolactone and enterodiol biosynthetic pathways have been found in several bacterial strains metabolizing lignans. Lignans are degraded from lignin, an abundant plant-derived polymer, secondary to cellulose in amount in the Earth, by GM. Furthermore, several bacterial strains present in the gut, such as Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$, Lactococcus garvieae, Slackia equolifaciens, Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, and Slackia sp. NATTS can metabolize daidzein to equol and @sm$ O-desmethylangolensin @/sm$.	1
In the intestine, quercetin is converted by the microbiota to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, also known as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, @sm$ 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid @/sm$, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ cladobacterium have been identified as the strains that convert quercetin to the compounds indicated above.	1
In the intestine, quercetin is converted by the microbiota to @sm$ 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid @/sm$, also known as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ cladobacterium have been identified as the strains that convert quercetin to the compounds indicated above.	1
In the next steps, we focused on the EW extract, the choice of which was based on the following experimental indications: the extract showed a high amount of @sm$ phenols @/sm$ and was among the most active extracts able to inhibit IL-8 release, induced by both @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ or TNF-alpha; it was also active in inhibiting @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ growth and the release of IL-6; it is reasonable to consider the combination of water and ethanol as a safer and cheaper extraction solvent than ethanol alone.	3
In the nucleotide metabolism pathway, genes participating in the purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism (nrdD, dgk, dck, pyrE, upp, pyrR, and pydC) were significantly enriched in dMMR CRC, indicating a reinforced conversion of nucleotides, which was concordant with the depletion of nucleotide, purine, and pyrimidine in dMMR CRC including uridine, deoxyinosine, deoxyguanosine, thymine, @sm$ hypoxanthine @/sm$, guanine, and uracil (online supplemental figure S2). Next, we conducted the Spearman's correlation analysis to further investigate the association between differential microbiota and the KO genes (figure 4B). The species under phylum Bacteroidetes, including P. enoeca, P. intermedia, P. cangingivalis, @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, M.	2
In the pentose phosphate pathway, phosphoketolase splits fructose-6-phosphate into E4P and @sm$ acetyl-phosphate @/sm$ (Figure 4a).- In a recent study, overexpression of heterologous phosphoketolase BbxfpK from @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ led to a 5.4-fold increase of intracellular E4P concentration in S.	1
In the present study, @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ strain indica was isolated from a fecal sample of a healthy adult Indian subject. An approximately 500-mg fecal sample was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), diluted serially in the same buffer, and plated on a prereduced Trypticase soy agar plate (pH 7.3) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep blood. Bacterial cells were spread over the surface of the plates using four or five glass beads (3.00 mm). Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 C in an anaerobic workstation (Whitley DG250) filled with 80% N2, 10% @sm$ CO2 @/sm$, and 10% H2. A single colony of @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ was grown in 5 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) for 48 h. Growth of the cells in TSB was monitored by spectrophotometer. @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ cells were harvested from 2 ml of culture by centrifugation (8,000 x g for 3 min), and the genomic DNA was extracted by the THSTI method.	2
In the present study, the species contributors to the key SCFAs mainly come from the phyla of Actinobacteria (genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Collinsella), Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides and Prevotella), Bacillota (genus Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum), Bacteroidota (genus Alistipes), and Firmicutes (genus Ruminococcus, Dialister, and Dorea). Alistipes is a bile-resistant anaerobic acid-producing @sm$ indole @/sm$-positive genus. The major product of Alistipes putredinis is succinate, as well as acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and propionic acids, which are produced in smaller amounts. Alistipes population found in the human gastrointestinal tract is correlated with fiber and processed food consumption in the diet. Studies showed that the consumption of food of animal origin for a limited time increases the abundance of bile-tolerant and putrofactive microorganisms such as A. putredinis. Alistipes genus is also related to fatigue and stress, which are also seen in mood disorders such as depression. This might be related to Alistipes being an @sm$ indole @/sm$-positive organism that effects serotonin availability in a negative way.	1
In the same well, 500 microL of the @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ crude biosurfactant (final concentration = MIC) was added as a treatment. For the positive control, the same volume of chloramphenicol was used with test strains. For the negative control, the same volume of sterile water was used with the test strains. After the incubation period of 24 h at 37  C, glass cover slips with formed biofilms were gently removed and washed with PBS. Staining was performed with 0.1% @sm$ CV @/sm$ as described above, followed by washing and air-drying for 5 min. Cover slips stained with @sm$ CV @/sm$ were then observed under LM with 40x magnification (Axioscope A1, ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany).	3
In the succinate pathway, the primitive electron transfer chain using @sm$ phosphoenolpyruvate @/sm$ (@sm$ PEP @/sm$) can be utilized to generate propionate. Specifically, @sm$ PEP @/sm$ is carboxylated to oxalacetate, and then oxalacetate is sequentially converted into malate and fumarate. The latter accepts electrons from NADH using a fumarate reductase and a NADH dehydrogenase, which form a simple electron-transfer chain. The NADH dehydrogenase transport protons across the cell membrane. These protons are utilized for chemiosmotic ATP synthesis. Likewise, succinate is generated as a result of the fumarate reductase. When the carbon dioxide partial pressure is low, succinate is transformed to methylmalonate, which leads to propionate and carbon dioxide. The latter can be recycled for the @sm$ PEP @/sm$ carboxylation, repeating the process. Bacteroidetes and several Firmicutes belonging to the Negativicutes class use this pathway for the propionate formation. Besides, acrylate pathway can be used to reduce lactate to propionate by a lactoyl-CoA dehydratase. This pathway is only present in a very reduced number of gut bacteria, including @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$.	2
In this manuscript, we report the expression, purification, spectroscopic and structural analysis, and product characterization for CYP152K6 from the methylotroph @gm$ Bacillus methanolicus @/gm$. CYP152K6 is a previously uncharacterized member of the CYP152 P450 peroxygenase family which is able to hydroxylate at both the alpha and beta carbons on its fatty acid substrate. CYP152K6 co-purifies with tetradecanoic acid bound in the active site, enabling the analysis of the unusual binding mode of this @sm$ lipid @/sm$.	1
In this study, a new strain of genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ is reported. Nine species in this genus, including @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, C. intestinalis, C.tanakaei, C.stercoris, C. bouchesdurhonensis, C. phocaeensis, C. ihuae, C. provencensis and C. vaginalis, have been reported before. Several studies demonstrated that @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ could modify host bile acids and plasma cholesterol levels. Acetic acid, @sm$ formic acid @/sm$ and lactic acid are the main fermented products of the genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$.	1
In this study, a series of sulfonamide compounds was designed and synthesized through the systematic optimization of the antibacterial agent @sm$ sulfaphenazole @/sm$ for the treatment of @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ (M. tuberculosis). Preliminary results indicate that the 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide moiety plays a key role in maintaining antimycobacterial activity. Compounds 10c, 10d, 10f and 10i through the optimization on phenyl ring at the R2 site on the pyrazole displayed promising antimycobacterial activity paired with low cytotoxicity. In particular, compound 10d displayed good activity (MIC = 5.69 mug/mL) with low inhibition of CYP 2C9 (IC50 > 10 muM), consequently low potential risk of drug-drug interaction. These promising results provide new insight into the combination regimen using sulfonamide as one component for the treatment of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$.	4
In this study, the @sm$ acetaldehyde @/sm$ concentration was positively associated with bacterial count on the tongue; diversity of the tongue microbiome; and relative abundance of G. sanguinis, @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$, and N. flavescens, species known to produce @sm$ acetaldehyde @/sm$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to clarify the relationship between @sm$ acetaldehyde @/sm$ concentration in mouth air and the characteristics of the microbiome on the tongue dorsum in healthy adults.	1
In this study, the amounts of Bifidobacterium sp., Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp., and @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$-E. rectale in faeces decreased, and the amount of E. coli spp. increased in rats with CKD caused by adenine. However, probiotic treatment increased the amount of Bifidobacterium sp., Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp., and @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$-E. rectale in faeces and decreased the amount of E. coli in adenine-induced CKD rats. In general, Bifidobacterium sp. are known to activate intestinal immunity and produce butyric acid from @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ and acetic acid in the intestines, while Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp. produce @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ in the intestines and inhibit pathogenic bacteria.	1
In this study, the effects of cefaclor, @sm$ cefdinir @/sm$ and cefixime on intestinal microbiota and lung injury were investigated in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)-infected mice. The results showed that the proportion of coccus and bacillus in intestinal microbiota were changed after oral administration with cefaclor, @sm$ cefdinir @/sm$ and cefixime twice for 10 days, respectively. Compared with the Spn-infected group, the proportion of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus in intestine were significantly reduced, while Enterococcus and Candida was increased after cephalosporin treatment. Furthermore, 3 cephalosporins could obviously increase the number of total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF as well as the serum levels of endotoxin, IL-2, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Mechanically, cephalosporins accelerated Spn-induced pulmonary barrier dysfunction via mediating the mRNA expressions of endothelial barrier-related proteins (Claudin 5, Occludin, and ZO-1) and inflammation-related proteins (TLR4, p38 and NF-kappaB). However, all of those consequences could be partly reversed by @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ treatment, which was closely related to the elevated acetate production, indicating the protective effects of probiotic against antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis.	3
In this study, we describe two enzymatic cascades to synthesize AICA derivatives with defined phosphorylation levels from the corresponding nucleobase and the co-substrate @sm$ phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate @/sm$. The cascades are composed of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli (EcAPT) and different polyphosphate kinases: polyphosphate kinase from @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ (AjPPK), and polyphosphate kinase from Meiothermus ruber (MrPPK).	1
In this study, we observed that the genera @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, Roseburia, Alistipes, Holdemanella, Collinsella, and Dorea were significantly more abundant in the fecal bacteria of the native Tibetans than in those of the Han immigrants. @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ and Roseburia produce butyrate from complex carbohydrates and plant polysaccharides, and butyrate is a major SCFA product from an intestinal source, providing at least 60-70% of the energy requirements of colonocytes. SCFAs act not only as energy sources for the colonic epithelium but also as systemic nutrients. SCFA levels can directly affect the substrate and energy metabolism in the peripheral tissues, such as adipose tissues, skeletal muscle, and liver. SCFA producers are also responsible for regulating the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Notably, SCFAs have been shown to contribute to the production of hematopoietic precursors in SPF mice. A high-fat diet was associated with an increased abundance of Alistipes relative to that associated with a lower-fat diet in healthy young adults in a 6-month randomized, controlled feeding trial. Alistipes is also more abundant in patients with type 2 diabetes. Tibetans frequently consume high-fat foods, such as buttered tea, cheese, and meat. However, in our study, the Tibetans had normal BMIs and no diabetes. Holdemanella biformis is associated with @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and free fatty acids. The elevated lipid concentration in Tibetans might be attributable to increased lipid synthesis. Collinsella can alter the intestinal absorption of @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$, reducing glycogenesis in the liver and increasing triglyceride synthesis, and the abundance of Collinsella correlates positively with circulating insulin. Therefore, it is possible that having more @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, Roseburia, Alistipes, Holdemanella, and Collinsella in the intestine is beneficial for energy capture.	1
In this study, we show that @gm$ B dentium @/gm$-produced metabolites stimulate 5-HT release from enterochromaffin cells both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that @gm$ B dentium @/gm$-colonized mice showed increased intestinal @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and increased 5-HT concentrations in the intestinal lumen. These effects were not observed in mice treated with heat-killed @gm$ B dentium @/gm$ or mono-associated with another commensal microbe: Bacteroides ovatus. @gm$ B dentium @/gm$ mono-association also altered the expression of several key intestinal serotonin receptors, particularly isoforms 2a (Htr2a), and 4 (Htr4), and the 5-HT transporter, serotonin transporter (Sert), compared with germ-free controls. In addition, @gm$ B dentium @/gm$-colonized mice up-regulated expression of Htr2a in the hippocampus and colonization normalized the anxiolytic behavior observed in germ-free mice during the marble bury test. Together, these data show that @gm$ B dentium @/gm$ can modulate serotonin-receptor-mediated signaling in the gut and brain of a gnotobiotic mammal.	1
In this work, bacteria were isolated from breastfed infant faeces and their capability to consume the oligosaccharides @sm$ 2'FL @/sm$, 3FL, DFL, LNT and LNnT, that are present in human breast milk, was analyzed. The isolated strains belonging to the species E. faecalis, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. paracasei, L. reuteri, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ did not utilize any of the HMOs tested. However, B. infantis and B. dentium isolated strains metabolized those HMOs, contributing to the hypothesis that these carbohydrates mainly promote the growth of Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut. Importantly, the extent to which both species utilized HMOs was very different. While B. infantis totally consumed all tested HMOs and resulting intermediary degradation carbohydrates, B. dentium only degraded LNT and LNnT. The two subspecies of B. longum that often colonize the infant intestine are B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum, and they differ in their ability to metabolize HMOs. While in the latest subspecies the capacity to metabolize HMOs is limited to specific strains and to certain types of HMOs, in B. infantis the ability to consume a wide range of HMOs is characteristic of the entire subspecies. The ability of the B. infantis Y538 strain to ferment all the HMOs assayed here is in agreement with the high capacity to consume HMOs widely described for B. infantis. This species contains genes encoding alpha-l-fucosidases involved in the metabolism of @sm$ 2'FL @/sm$, 3FL and DFL.	2
In this work, we explore the effects of O-acetylation on the physical and immunological characteristics of the WHO International Standards of Vi polysaccharide (Vi) from both Citrobacter freundii and @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi @/gm$. We find that, although structurally identical according to NMR, the two Vi standards have differences with respect to susceptibility to de-O-acetylation and viscosity in water. Vi standards from both species have equivalent mass and O-acetylation-dependent binding to a mouse monoclonal antibody and to anti-Vi polyclonal antisera, including the WHO International Standard for human anti-typhoid capsular Vi @sm$ PS @/sm$ IgG. This study also confirms that human anti-Vi sera binds to completely de-O-acetylated Vi. Molecular dynamics simulations provide conformational rationales for the known effect of de-O-acetylation both on the viscosity and antigenicity of the Vi, demonstrating that de-O-acetylation has a very marked effect on the conformation and dynamic behavior of the Vi, changing the capsular polysaccharide from a rigid helix into a more flexible coil, as well as enhancing the strong interaction of the polysaccharide with sodium ions. Partial de-O-acetylation of Vi revealed hidden epitopes that were recognized by human and sheep anti-Vi @sm$ PS @/sm$ immune sera.	3
In total, 37 different bacterial species were isolated, and the major isolates included @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ (7.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%), Shigella spp. (14.2%), Yersinia enterocolitica (6.7%), and Pseudomonas spp. (16.3%). No Vibrio cholerae could be isolated; however, V. fluvialis was isolated from three water samples. The isolated organisms were highly resistant to cefazolin (83.5%), cefoxitin (69.2%), @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$ (66.4%), and cefuroxime (66.2%).	4
In vitro anti-@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ activity of the synthesized AgNps was determined by the agar dilution method in accordance with the guidelines provided by CLSI. The results were recorded as minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs). Different concentrations of the synthesized AgNps were prepared by the sample digestion method. @sm$ Silver @/sm$ nanoparticles were centrifuged and the pellet thus obtained was washed several times with deionized water in order to remove un-reacted @sm$ silver @/sm$ ions. The removal of un-reacted @sm$ silver @/sm$ was further confirmed by treating each filtrate with 1 mM HCl until no silver chloride was precipitated. In order to determine the concentration of AgNps for susceptibility studies, the pellet free from @sm$ silver @/sm$ ions was divided into two halves. One half was dissolved in aqua-regia and the solution evaporated near to dryness. The process of dilution and dryness was repeated three times. In this way, the AgNps were converted to AgNO3. The concentration of @sm$ silver @/sm$ ions was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The other half of the nanoparticles, having a concentration almost equal to the first half, was used for anti-@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ activities. Fourteen wells on a 96-wells plate were filled with a two-fold serially diluted colloidal suspension of @sm$ silver @/sm$ nanoparticles in distilled water having final concentrations of 128 to 0.125 mug mL-1.	3
Indeed, mice with colonic epithelial cell-specific Atg7 deficiency show altered fecal microbiota composition with an increase in total bacteria and an enrichment in Clostridum leptum, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ and Bacteroides fragilis compared to WT control mice. Furthermore, mice with colonic epithelial cell-specific Atg7 deficiency exhibit increased bacterial burden in the colonic epithelium compared with WT mice under the steady state and following @sm$ DSS @/sm$-induced colitis. Similarly, compared with WT mice, Atg5[DeltaIEC] mice exhibit altered gut microbiota composition with reduced diversity, as observed in CD, and a decreased number of the bacteria implicated in the control of inflammatory responses, such as those from the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, of which the abundance is decreased in CD. Conversely, Atg5[DeltaIEC] mice exhibit an increased number of pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as those from the Pasteurellaceae family, of which the abundance is increased in CD. Moreover, Atg5[DeltaIEC] mice exhibit decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, as shown in IBD, and increased abundance of Candidatus Athromitus, segmented filamentous bacteria able to induce the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells towards Th (T helper) 1 and Th17 cells implicated in IBD pathogenesis. Recently, changes in the fecal microbiota composition of knock-in mice expressing the ATG16L1T300A variant compared to WT mice at steady state with an increase in the order Bacteroidales was reported. During @sm$ DSS @/sm$-induced colitis, the knock-in mice display altered fecal microbial composition associated with a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in the phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, compared to WT mice.	3
Induction of fumB highlights the hypothesis that @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ may use fumarate as an electron acceptor under anoxia, itself converted to @sm$ succinate @/sm$ by succinate dehydrogenase (Al Dahouk et al.,) (Figure 6B). Our previous proteome data already suggested that @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ may use the reductive branch of the TCA cycle under anaerobiosis (Al Dahouk et al.,). @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ possesses dehydrogenases specific for glycerol-3-P (BR0200, glpD), L-lactate and NADH, efficient electron donors for fumarate reduction in E. coli (Gennis and Valley,), the latter two were however repressed by RegA (see results). While anaerobiosis becomes established, use of oxygen via a terminal cytochrome c oxidase may be shifting to the use of fumarate as an alternative electron acceptor, adapted to low energetic needs. We suggest that decreased expression of aceA in the WT strain may be related to increased expression of fumB, as a mean to limit @sm$ succinate @/sm$ accumulation (Figure 6B) and, under our experimental conditions, may also be explained by the lack of fatty acids in the medium.	2
Information for @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ and P. pentosaceus on growth pHs and temperatures, as well as the ability to ferment various sugars has been given by Mundt et al., Garvie and Ray et al.. Most strains are able to ferment glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, @sm$ cellobiose @/sm$, arabinose, ribose, salicin, amygdalin, esculin, but not ferment sorbose, melibiose, inulin, starch, dextrin and sugar alcohols. Fermentation of other carbohydrates is strain dependent. Glucose has been found to have an inhibitory effect on growth of @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ cultures.	2
Inhibitory effects of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation were tested by treating the LAB cell extract on C3H10T1/2 cells. Because the strains assigned to @gm$ Lactococcus taiwanensis @/gm$ and Weissella paramesenteroides caused cell damage during the treatment process, they were excluded from the test. A wide range of inhibitory effects of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation was observed in the strains selected. Among the strains tested, five strains (Pediococcus pentosaceus K28; Levilactobacillus brevis RP20 and RP21; Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RP11 and RP12) reduced @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation by more than 20% compared with the control, indicating that they have anti-adipogenic effects (Fig.	3
Initially, both the fast and slow anaerobic digesters exhibited considerable levels of resistance to the 1 mg   liter-1 of @sm$ monensin @/sm$ that was added to the control manure substrate. The microbial communities of these digesters remained relatively similar to their predisturbance states for this concentration of @sm$ monensin @/sm$ (Fig. 3B, first two data points in P3 and P4, respectively; Fig. 4C and D). Even though this @sm$ monensin @/sm$ concentration was higher than our observed concentrations in the dairy cow manure, it is similar to @sm$ monensin @/sm$ concentrations that were previously found to be inhibitory in anaerobic digesters. After increasing the concentration to 5 mg   liter-1, the PCoA and taxon biplot (showing only the fast and slow anaerobic digester samples) clearly reveal that the microbiomes of these anaerobic digesters diverged under such relatively high concentrations of @sm$ monensin @/sm$ (Fig. 5A and B). Two separate previously rare operational taxonomic units (OTUs) rapidly rose to high levels of relative abundance for the fast and slow anaerobic digesters during the disturbed conditions. In the next paragraph, we will discuss the OTU (a member of the genus @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$) that increased in the fast anaerobic digester.	4
Instead, a bacterial dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase (DoDC) from @gm$ Pseudomonas Putida @/gm$ (Koyanagi) was reported to convert DOPA to dopamine (Fig. 2A). Engineered yeast expressing PpDoDC can produce dopamine and the downstream product @sm$ norcoclaurine @/sm$ with a titer of 49 mug/L, when fed with 2 mM DOPA in the cultural medium (Trenchard et al.).	1
Interaction of p-aminobenzamidine with GroEL suggests that @sm$ benzamidine @/sm$-derived compounds may affect expression of GroEL in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$. To verify this assumptionwe analysed expression of groEL in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ exposed to heat and @sm$ benzamidine @/sm$-derivatives. Heat stress (1 h at 45 C) increased the mRNA expression of groEL in M5-1-2 strain of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ (p<0.05). Similarly, supplementation of cultures with @sm$ benzamidine @/sm$ and pentamidineled to a significant increase in mRNA levels for groEL. This effect was always slightly more pronounced in the clinical isolate M5-1-2 (p<0.01) than in the reference strain @gm$ ATCC 33277 @/gm$ (p<0.05).	3
Interestingly, although @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$ members are not known to produce @sm$ nicotinate @/sm$ metabolites, to which @sm$ niacin @/sm$ belongs, the investigated L. lactis strain was characterized by the highest vitamin B3 secretion among all tested B-group vitamins. In their work, Jung et al. detected @sm$ niacin @/sm$ production for the first time in a @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$ member, namely in @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ WiKim0068, isolated from fermented cabbage (kimchi). The detected @sm$ niacin @/sm$ concentration (0.932 mg/L) was similar to that obtained for Leuconostoc spp. (0.837-1.05 mg/L) and was far higher when Lactobacillus species were applied -0.05-0.1 mg/L. The @sm$ niacin @/sm$ production capacity of @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ WiKim0068 was slightly higher compared to that of L. lactis cultured on the same medium (MRSB) in our study; however, such differences may have resulted from varied incubation times, i.e., 48 h compared to 24 h, respectively. Moreover, as we showed, the @sm$ niacin @/sm$ secretion level of L.	1
Interestingly, bacteria that were enriched in preweaning calves with more Brahman breed proportion included Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, and Butyrivibrio that are fiber-digesting and beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Consistently, microbial genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in preweaning calves with higher Brahman proportion (P = 0.0012) predicted by PICRUSt, especially for genes participating in the metabolism of fructose, mannose, galactose, starch, and @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ (Supplementary Fig.	2
Interestingly, both hub microbes and keystone species were found to vary over time, but distinctly based on @sm$ LVX @/sm$ prophylaxis and nutritional support. At baseline, we identified 5 keystone species in the GM network of EN patients, namely Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, R. lactatiformans, F. prausnitzii and Eggerthella lenta, with the latter two also representing hub nodes. A general prevalence of hub species belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium (i.e., B. longum and B. breve) and phylum Bacteroidetes (i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides uniformis and @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$) was reported over time in the EN group.	0
Interestingly, of ahpC, katB and perA only disruption of perA sensitized @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ to H2O2 in vitro (Figure 3B). Furthermore, of strains disrupted individually for sodA, sodB and sodC only disruption of sodB sensitized @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ to the superoxide generating compound @sm$ plumbagin @/sm$ (Figure 3C). We also tested the DeltaprxA mutant but found that it did not show increased sensitivity to either H2O2 or @sm$ plumbagin @/sm$ (Figure S2A and data not shown). It is possible that some of these known ROS defense enzymes overlap in function masking the effects of a deficiency in any one gene in vitro or in mouse studies. For other bacterial pathogens and symbionts deletion of several or all catalases and superoxide dismutases has been required before a strong effect on virulence or symbiosis was observed. Currently, the results from our analysis suggest RNS may pose a significant barrier to @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ in colonizing the infant mouse.	3
Interestingly, the preparations were alcohol-free and exhibited similar efficacy to 0.2% @sm$ chlorhexidine @/sm$. The same research group has suggested that the incorporation of CBD into dental polish can assist in plaque removal. On the other hand, also in the oral context, Gu et al. have shown that cannabinoids, including CBD, exhibit differential activities against common bacterial components of dental plaque. For example, @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ appears phytocannabinoid-resistant while Filifactor alocis is sensitive.	4
Interestingly, there was a subgroup of these children that was dominated by @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ abundances compared to two subgroups with low @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and increased Akkermansia abundances. The @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$-dominated subgroup was characterized by early introduction of non-milk diet, increased risk for early autoantibody development, and by lower abundances of genes for the production of butyrate via co-fermentation of @sm$ acetate @/sm$. In contrast to children in the @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$-dominated subgroup, children in the Akkermansia-dominated subgroups harbour a microbiome that seems to prefer butyrate-production through the co-fermentation of @sm$ acetate @/sm$.	2
Interestingly, we identified an ORF encoding a putative Tcp in the ICEKp258.2 island found in @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistant K. pneumoniae ST258 strains, which may have a role in the resistance of this ST against phagocityc killing. The other two putative Tcp encoded in the GIs from @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ ser.	4
Introduction of an NADPH-specific alcohol dehydrogenase (NADPH-ADH) not only reduces the NADH demand of the acetate-to-ethanol pathway but also allows the cell to effectively exchange @sm$ NADPH @/sm$ for NADH during sugar fermentation. Unlike NADH, @sm$ NADPH @/sm$ can be freely generated under anoxic conditions, via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. We show that an industrial bioethanol strain engineered with the original pathway (expressing acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$ and with deletions of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes GPD1 and GPD2) consumed 1.9 g liter(-1) acetate during fermentation of 114 g liter(-1) glucose.	1
Investigation into the patients whose samples were associated with @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ did not reveal shared epidemiological risk factors for the acquisition of this pathogen. None of the patients had clinical features of C. sordellii infection, such as a leukemoid reaction or TSS. Patient 1 was a 59 year old male receiving chronic suppressive therapy with clindamycin for chronic sinusitis, whose sinus cultures grew Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$. Clindamycin was extended 6 weeks in response to the @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ isolate without adverse effect.. Patient 2 had two cultures positive for @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$, including inguinal abscess and a foot abscess, each of which yielded multiple organisms. Patient 3 had a bone culture performed for a diabetic foot osteomyelitis, which yielded S. aureus in addition to @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$. The patient was treated with a first-generation cephalosporin with a good clinical response. The fourth patient had nasal mucosal tissue cultures performed due to chronic rhinosinusitis, which yielded @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and multiple other anaerobic bacteria. The patient responded to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin. The fifth patient had cultures obtained from a debridement of infected bone and prosthetic materials that were used to repair a previous fracture. These grew coagulase-negative staphylococci and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$. Vancomycin was used initially but ampicillin-sulbactam was added in response to the @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$, which was later changed to @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$. The patient developed diarrhea 48 hrs into @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ therapy, which was stopped. The wrist infection improved with vancomycin alone for 10 weeks. Lastly, patient 6 was a renal transplant recipient with diabetes mellitus, who grew @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ and Serratia marcescens from a culture of a postoperative wound infection of the foot.	3
Isolates identified as @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ species were tested for antibiotic resistance using the disk diffusion test according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The isolated @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ was tested for resistance to ampicillin, @sm$ trimethoprim @/sm$, vancomycin, and nitrofurantoin.	4
Isolates of the @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ bacterium @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ are a major part of fermentation processes, especially in Korean kimchi.	1
Isolates were first identified as @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ by their slow growth rate on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) slants, colony morphology, sensitivity to p-nitrobenzoic (PNB) acid and further subjected to biochemical test (catalase test and @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reduction test).	3
It eliminates sucrose, maltose, @sm$ isomaltose @/sm$, lactose, all true and pseudo-grains and grain-derived flours, potatoes, okra, corn, fluid milk, soy, cheeses with high amounts of lactose and most food additives and preservatives. The diet is supplemented with fully fermented yogurt, to free it from lactose. Some recommended cultures are Lactobacillus bulgaricus, @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$, and Streptococcus thermophilus.	2
It had been reported that many @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. could degrade aromatic hydrocarbons or phenolic substances. @sm$ Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @/sm$ (@sm$ PAHs @/sm$), naphthalene, and crude oil could be degraded by @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. A. lwofii NCIB 10553 was one of the species which could use aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic esters as a sole carbon source. A long time ago, A. lwoffii K24 was reported to be capable to degrade aniline and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, although under the name of Burkholderia sp. K24. Similarly, in this study, @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ LN4 decolorized aniline-blue and degraded dibutyl phthalate, which was also a monocyclic aromatic compound. Jiang isolated A. johnsonii strain from waste oil. It can decompose naphthalene and phenanthrene while purifying sewage via sedimentation. Crude oil can also be co-degraded by A. johnsonii XM-02 and Pseudomonas sp. XM-01, which was isolated from the soil polluted by crude oil at China's Bohai Bay. Lignin was composed of a wide variety of aromatic compounds; the basic unit was a phenylpropanoid group. @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp.	2
It has been found that the major components of oil from Kerman Province are; piperitone (61.0%), @sm$ beta-caryophyllene @/sm$ (14.4%), from Jiroft; piperitone (45%), delta-3-carene (22.5%) and alpha-eudesmol (13.3%). In another study, piperitone (53.3%), alpha-terpinene (13.6%) and elemol (7.7%) were found to be the major constituents of oil with excellent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Salmonella typhimurium, @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$, Escherichia coli.	3
It has been reported as well that resistance to @gm$ ORT @/gm$ antibiotics is varied according to the region from which it was isolated. Thus, the degree of resistance would also differ. However, in France and Belgium, 98% and 71% of the isolates were sensitive to @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ in vitro, respectively. In contrast, ORTs were resistant to @sm$ quinolone @/sm$, tetracycline, lincosamide, and macrolide. This result is among the important factors affecting @gm$ ORT @/gm$ treatments, due to the common use of these antibiotics in Iraq as the first choice for treatment, given that lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin had good inhibition rates.	4
It has been shown that the plasmids responsible for production in @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ H can be transferred intragenerically by conjugation. The pediocin PA-1/@sm$ AcH @/sm$ is the only class IIa bacteriocin for which both cross-species and cross-genera synthesis are known to occur.	1
It has been well known that EptA adds a phosphoethanolamine moiety to @sm$ lipid A @/sm$ and confers PMB resistance to other Vibrio species including V. cholerae and @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$. However, the eptA expression is not regulated by the CarRS TCS in V. cholerae. In @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$, EptA increases survival within macrophage cells, suggesting that LPS modification induces resistance to host immune clearance.	4
It is known that particular Streptococcus species such as Streptococcus suis and @gm$ Streptococcus pasteurianus @/gm$ belong to the common microbiome of the pig's intestinal tract. Moreover, it should be noted here that Desulfotomaculum carboxydivorans was identified at rank nine for BGP_WF and at rank eight for BGP_DF in fragment recruitments. This bacterium is able to catabolize low-molecular weight compounds (pyruvate, @sm$ lactate @/sm$, glucose etc.) and reduces sulfate as terminal electron acceptor to sulfide (hydrogen sulfide), which is deleterious in biogas since it leads to corrosion of combustion units and in pipelines.	2
It is reported that administering a probiotic which contains live @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ LA-5 plus Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 leads to reduced incidence of mild to moderate and severe diarrhea in cervical cancer patients who undergo beam pelvic radiotherapy. In a study, a probiotic drink has been used for patients with cervical carcinoma who received radiotherapy and weekly @sm$ cisplatin @/sm$.	3
It is worth noting that the resistant rates of amikacin, gentamicin, @sm$ spectinomycin @/sm$, florfenicol, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin in S. Derby and S. Typhimurium were higher than those in @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$. Meanwhile, the resistant rate to fosfomycin from higher to lower was S. Derby (43.0%), @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ (27.2%), and S. Typhimurium (10.0%) (Figure 3B). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, 99.8% (616/617) Salmonella isolates were identified as multi-drug resistant, being resistant to more than 3 antibiotics. Some of isolates (9.7%, 60/617) were even resistant up to 12 antibiotics, two strains were resistant to 20 antibiotics, both of which were S. Typhimurium isolates. It is clear that S. Derby was mainly resistant to 9 (13/107, 12.1%), 11(14/107, 13.1%) and 14 antibiotics (14/107, 13.1%), S. Typhimurium was mainly resistant to 13 (10/74, 13.5%) and 15 (9/74, 12.2%) antibiotics, and @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ was mainly resistant to 8 (10/81, 12.3%), 9 (13/81, 16.0%) and 11 (10/81, 12.3%) antibiotics (Supplementary Figure S2).	4
It may be synthesized through carbonation of @sm$ hydrogen sulphide @/sm$, as a detoxification mechanism exerted by colonic bacteria. In agreement with the previous report, AD children showed significantly lower levels of total SCFA compared to fecal samples of HC. The only exception was found for propionic acid, which is probably involved in the autism. SCFA was mainly produced by clostridial clusters IV and XIVa of Firmicutes including species of Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$) (67).	1
It should be also mentioned, that IgG Fc regions in RA patients harbour significantly fewer @sm$ galactose @/sm$ residues than those in age-matched healthy controls, thus lack of terminal @sm$ galactose @/sm$ residues may play a role in more severe disease progression. @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$ is a saccharolytic bacterium, that metabolises @sm$ galactose @/sm$ molecules, then it binds to the Fc region of IgG antibodies and metabolises @sm$ galactose @/sm$ residues.	2
It was previously shown that ferricyanide could serve as electron acceptor during the oxidation of @sm$ nicotinic acid @/sm$ by @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$.	2
It was reported that @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ could degrade oxalate into @sm$ formate @/sm$ through formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase. The urinary oxalate level decreased in rats with hyperoxaluria after supplementation with @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$. However, the results of clinical trials were contrary to each other. A randomised phase II/III study reported that the changes in urinary oxalate levels were not different between primary hyperoxaluria patients treated with or without @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$. Another ongoing Phase II study found that 24 months @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ administration substantially decreased plasma oxalate concentrations when compared with an untreated natural control cohort.	1
Its natural production takes place in the large intestine with the participation of Bacteroidetes spp, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp., Firmicutes, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$, Ruminococus spp., Cllostridium spp., Clostridiales bactrium, Eubacterium spp, Coprococcus spp., Dialister succinatiphilus, Phascolarctobaterium succinatutens, Akkermansia muciniphila (succinate pathway), Clostridium sp., Clostridiales bacterium, Coproccus catus, Clostridium sp., (acrylate pathway), @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ insulinivorans, Ruminococus spp., Eubacterium halli, and Clostridium sp. (propanediol pathway). Propionic acid plays a role in the metabolism of lipids in the liver and affects the biosynthesis of @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ in this organ. This acid is also used as a natural mold growth inhibitor and is therefore used as a preservative in food (cheese and bread) and animal feed. Moreover, it has been proven that propionic acid is a precursor in gluconeogenesis, while acetate and butyrate are involved in the regulation of @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ synthesis. In vivo studies have shown that propionic acid can inhibit de novo fatty acids and @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$.	1
Just to summarize the most relevant findings in this field, low amount of @sm$ GABA @/sm$-producing gut bacteria (e.g., @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$) have been observed in PD patients (Minato et al.,). In the CNS, the Ca2+/@sm$ GABA @/sm$ signaling is relevant for neuronal activity and calcium homeostasis, therefore a decline in the @sm$ GABA @/sm$ amount may contribute to neurodegeneration (Blaszczyk,).	1
Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 258) was the main cause of neonatal sepsis, with Serratia marcescens (n = 151), @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (n = 117), Escherichia coli (n = 75) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 57) also detected. We present whole-genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical data for 916 out of 1,038 neonatal sepsis isolates (97 isolates were not recovered from initial isolation at local sites). Enterobacterales (K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae) harboured multiple cephalosporin and @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$ resistance genes.	4
LEfSe and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis were used to identify two key species (Odoribacter splanchnicus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$) and five key metabolites (ouabain, @sm$ taurochenodeoxycholic acid @/sm$, glycochenodeoxycholate, theophylline, and xanthine) associated with HCC, which then were combined to create panels for HCC diagnosis.	0
LEfSe results (Figure 6 and Figure 7) indicate the differentiation of PCOS patients and controls by the abundance of features identified as @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$, in individuals with PCOS. @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ DISK18 has already been described for its biofilm forming capacity as well as the production of an important oxidative stress response (e.g., chaperone dnaK gene cluster, heat shock protein 33, superoxidase reductase), @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and phosphate starvation (e.g., stringent starvation a and b, Pho H) proteins., cofactors and vitamins (e.g., vitamin B complex).	1
Label from (14)CO(2) was incorporated into the @sm$ succinate @/sm$ produced during maltose fermentation by B. amylophilus, and during glucose fermentation by @gm$ B. ruminicola @/gm$, and during cellobiose fermentation by B. succinogenes. All of the incorporated label could be associated with the carboxyl function of the molecule. The depression in radioactivity per micromole of carbon in the @sm$ succinate @/sm$ formed from the fermentation of uniformly labeled (14)C-maltose by B. amylophilus was greater than would be expected if all of the @sm$ succinate @/sm$ formed was produced via a direct CO(2) fixation pathway(s) involving phosphoenolpyruvate or pyruvate; the radioactivity per micromole of carbon suggests that as much as 60% of the total @sm$ succinate @/sm$ results from a pathway(s) involving direct CO(2) fixation. Maltose fermentation by B. amylophilus was dependent upon CO(2) concentration, but CO(2) concentration could not be shown to influence either the fermentation end-product ratios or the proportion of total @sm$ succinate @/sm$ formed attributable to CO(2) fixation.	1
"Laboratory diagnosis of syphilis, a chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$, relies basically on serological assays which include nontreponemal screening tests and treponemal confirmatory tests. Nontreponemal tests such as VDRL (venereal disease reference laboratory) detect antibodies to a nonspecific cardiolipin-@sm$ lecithin @/sm$-cholesterol antigen, which attributes to the ""biological false positive"" (BFP) results."	3
"Laboratory tests revealed positive serum @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ Hemagglutinin Test (TPHA) and rapid plasma reagin test (RPR). The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was positive with TPHA but negative for RPR with lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. Spinal MRI showed swelling and high-signal intensity of thoracic spinal cord except T6-7 level with associated @sm$ gadolinium @/sm$ enhancement (""flip-flop sign"") and peripheral strip-like enhancement on T1WI (""candle guttering appearance"")."	3
Lachnospiraceae such as Eubacterium rectale, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, Coprococcus spp., and Roseburia spp. have been associated with the production of butyrate, which is the major energy source of colonic epithelial tissue and may be involved in immune regulation and intestinal-barrier function. In contrast, recent studies have shown that butyrate is not universally beneficial for intestinal health. Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae differ with respect to their average numbers of @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-active genes and gene families, particularly glycoside hydrolases and @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-binding modules, which are more abundant and more diverse in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.	2
Lactobacillus reuteri increased the excitability and the number of action potentials per depolarizing pulse, decreased @sm$ calcium @/sm$ and potassium channel opening, and reduced slow after-hyperpolarization in IPANs. Specific bacterial strains may support the normal intestinal motor function as, in GF rats, derangement of the neuromuscular function and delay of intestinal transit were partially reversed after colonization with either Lactobacillus acidophilus or @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$, while Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus delayed gut motility.	3
Lactococcus produce @sm$ L (+) lactate @/sm$ from glucose as opposed to Leuconostoc produce D (-) lactate from glucose. One of the first studies isolating genus Lactococcus from finfish, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), was revealed by Cai et al., but later the genus has been isolated from the GI tract of several finfish species (Merrifield et al.,), and during the last years, numerous studies have revealed Lactococcus spp., L. lactis garvieae, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. piscium, and @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ in the GI tract of finfish (Table 1). In their study with turbot (Scophthalmus maximus); autochthonous microbiota in the entire intestine, Yang et al. revealed that dietary stachyose significantly elevated the abundance of Lactococcus as well as Carnobacterium, Pediococcus, and Enterococcus. Li et al. used culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques to investigate the autochthonous bacterial communities in the whole intestine of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) (Valenciennes) and revealed seven culturable strains showing high similarity (99%) to @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ and one OUT similar to @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$.	1
Lactulose is metabolized by colonic bacteria to monosaccharides and then to methane, volatile fatty acids, and @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$. In human studies, the lactulose have a significantly modified GM by increasing @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus, and having favorable health benefits (Table 1).	1
Levels of Prevotella dentalis were higher prior to treatment with IV @sm$ Ertapenem @/sm$, and continued to reduce during oral Ciprofloxacin, remaining at low levels post-treatment. Parabacteroides is also more abundant during IV @sm$ Ertapenem @/sm$ use and post-treatment but is suppressed during oral Ciprofloxacin treatment. There are three Alistipes species: two species are suppressed during oral Ciprofloxacin treatment, and displaced by Alistipes shahii, which is the most abundant during this phase. Following treatment there is a more equal mix of all three species, with Alistipes finegoldii and Alistipes sp. Marseille not recovering to pre-treatment levels but Alistipes shahii remaining higher ( Figure 1A/B). @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ significantly increased during treatment with IV @sm$ Ertapenem @/sm$ but reduced during oral Ciprofloxacin therapy, remaining low post-treatment.	3
Lignocellulose-derived pentose sugars (mainly D-xylose and @sm$ L-arabinose @/sm$) are not natural substrates of baker's yeast. The utilization of pentose can substantially improve bioresource utilization. An artificial complex consisting of endogenous sugar transporter Gal2 and heterologous xylose isomerase (XI) was constructed in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the substrate uptake rate and simultaneously reduced the production of byproduct xylitol (Figure 2(a)). The galactose transporter Gal2 and the low-activity hexose transporter Hxt9 could transport @sm$ L-arabinose @/sm$ with low affinity . Therefore, a high-affinity  and high-specificity L-arabinose transporter PcAraT from Penicillium chrysogenum was identified by characterizing sugar uptake kinetics in S. cerevisiae, which contributed to rapid and efficient conversion of @sm$ L-arabinose @/sm$. In another study, the absorptivity of oligosaccharides and pentose was reinforced in @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$ when the native ABC transporter complex PP1015~PP1018 was overexpressed.	2
Like previous studies, a prospective cohort study found that Shannon's diversity index was reduced by treatment with @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ relative to that in the untreated group, and decreased continuously for 6 months. It is noteworthy that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased by 60% in the antibiotic-treated group after 1 week and remained 50% lower than baseline after 6 months. The abundances of Bacteriodetes and Fusobacteria also decreased significantly. Surprisingly, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased at 1 month and Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus was detected at 1 month and persisted to the 3- and 6-month time points. However, no operational taxonomic units persisted up to 6 months in the control group. The use of @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ has also been shown to reduce the abundances of Neisseria, @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$, and Veillonella in the oral microbiota.	3
Like typical members in the genera Klebsiella , @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$  DX120E utilizes alanine, arabinose, D-arabitol, L-aspartate, D-cellobiose, citrate, D-fructose, L-fucose, D-galactose, gentiobiose, glucose, glycerol, myo-inositol, lactate, lactose, malate, maltose, @sm$ D-mannitol @/sm$, D-mannose, D-melibiose, L-proline, D-raffinose, L-rhamnose, L-serine, D-sorbitol, sucrose, and D-trehalose.	2
Likewise, dietary BCAAs, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$, leucine and valine can also regulate glucose and lipid metabolisms, and altered BCAA levels have been associated with insulin resistance, and enhanced risk for metabolic diseases. Interestingly, different bacteria (i.e., Prevotella copri and B. vulgatus) are potent producers of BCAAs, whereas others (i.e., @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Eubacterium siraeum) are able to take up BCAAs, suggesting that microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic diseases by modulating BCAAs levels.	2
Lipid A of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ was isolated with the Bligh-Dyer method. Specifically, overnight culture was inoculated into 250-mL cultures, in which the initial OD600 was 0.02, and then cells grew to an OD600 of 1.0. All @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min and then washed with ddH2O twice. The cell pellet was first suspended with 76 mL of mixture containing chloroform/H2O/@sm$ methanol @/sm$ (1:0.8:2 v/v/v). The insoluble debris was then collected and washed with 60 mL mixture. The debris was heated and suspended with 12.5 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) by boiling water bath for 30 min. The suspension was mixed with @sm$ methanol @/sm$ and chloroform and the mixture containing suspension/@sm$ methanol @/sm$/chloroform (27:30:30 v/v/v).	2
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of four nonencapsulated strains of the human enteric pathogen @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ were chemically characterized. When applied to two of the strains, extraction by a modified phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method (H. Brade and C. Galanos, Eur. J. Biochem. 122:233-237, 1982) gave better yields of LPS than did extraction by the conventional hot phenol-water technique. Constituents common to all LPS were D-glucose, D-galactose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid, D-glucuronic acid, D-galactosamine, and phosphorylethanolamine. Phosphate was present in a relatively high amount. In addition, the LPS of three strains contained N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas the LPS of the strain lacking this component contained 3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose. The lipid A component contained phosphate with D-glucosamine and 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-D-glucose as the major amino sugars. Ethanolamine-phosphate was present also. The major fatty acids were ester- and amide-bound 3-hydroxytetradecanoic and ester-bound @sm$ hexadecanoic acids @/sm$, with a minor amount of ester-bound tetradecanoic acid. This is the first report of N-acetylneuraminic acid in the oligosaccharide moiety and diaminoglucose in the lipid A of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ LPS.	1
Literature on CA inhibition reveals that many inhibitors, such as sulfonamide, sulfamides, sulfamates, anions, phenols, coumarins, dithiocarbamates, @sm$ fullerenes @/sm$, boronic acids, carboxylates, polyamines, benzamides, hydroxymates, and mercaptans have been tested against beta-CAs to control infectious organisms, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Leishmania donovani, Salmonella typhimurium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$.	3
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and @sm$ chloroform @/sm$. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by @sm$ chloroform @/sm$ did not show any antimicrobial activity against S.	3
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (IL)-1ss, IL-10, @sm$ prostaglandin E2 @/sm$, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum IgG antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (@gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$, Streptococcus sanguis, Prevotella loescheii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga ochracea).	0
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through bioassay-guided fractionation, nine compounds (1-9), with different scaffolds, were isolated from the @sm$ methanol @/sm$ extract of C. kirkii whose structures were identified by spectroscopic methods. Compounds 1-9 were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of eight Gram-positive, including five drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$, and two Gram-negative bacteria strains.	3
MBNPs such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), @sm$ palladium @/sm$ (@sm$ Pd @/sm$), copper (Cu), and platinum (Pt) have been incorporated with antimicrobial extracts for medical application as an effective antimicrobial agent due to their reduced size and selectivity towards bacteria and pathogens. MBNPs exhibited a non-specific toxicity mechanism against pathogens through direct contact with the microbial cell surface, attacking the peptidoglycan cell membrane in gram positive bacteria and invasion mechanism of lipopolysaccharides cell membrane in gram negative bacteria. Another study with @sm$ palladium @/sm$ NPs exhibits high antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against resistant clinical bacterial isolate @gm$ Cronobactersakazakii @/gm$ strain AMD04.	3
MCF10A cell lines were grown in DMEM:HamF12 (1:1) GIBCO supplemented with 5% Horse Serum GIBCO, 0,5 mug/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 20 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies), 10 mug/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 100 ng/ml Toxin from @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ (Sigma) and 50 mM HEPES GIBCO. All culture media were supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine GIBCO and 1% penicillin-streptomycin GIBCO . For MC10A-SNAIL and their MCF10A-PuroR counterpart, 0.5 mug/ml of @sm$ Puromycin @/sm$ was also added to maintain the plasmid.	3
METHODS: Using a microtiter assay system, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of @sm$ amikacin @/sm$, gentamicin, cephalothin and doxycycline on the surface hydrophobicity and production of acidic polysaccharide by @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ (8 human isolates, 8 environmental isolates) was determined.	3
MEVs released by Bacteroides fragilis contain @sm$ GABA @/sm$ and its intermediates alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate as part of their content. MEVs containing neuroactive compounds from B. fragilis may explain the observation of a previous study that showed the oral administration of this bacteria reduced gut permeability, microbiome dysbiosis, and several behavioral abnormalities in a mice model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Also, Bacteroides, a significant @sm$ GABA @/sm$-producing genus in the gut, was linked with higher levels of serotonin, and myoinositol, which is pivotal in maintaining signaling between the enteric and central nervous systems. The relative abundance of Bacteroides was negatively correlated with depression-associated brain signatures, indicating a significant role of microbiome-secreted @sm$ GABA @/sm$ in brain functionality. Likewise, have reported depletion of Bacteroides in depression and anxiety. Recently, metabolomics profiling of MEVs content isolated from human gut microbiome revealed presence of a wide array of embedded metabolites, including neurotransmitter-related compounds such as arachidonyl-dopamine (NADA), gabapentin, glutamate and N-acylethanolamines. The same authors reported that gut Bacteroides isolates (B. finegoldii, B. faecis, and @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$) produce high @sm$ GABA @/sm$ levels (4.5-7 mM range) in supernatants, and importantly, @sm$ GABA @/sm$ was detected inside secreted microvesicles at 2.2-4 muM.	1
MacConkey agar is considered a low @sm$ iron @/sm$-containing medium which has been used to identify high-affinity @sm$ iron @/sm$ and zinc uptake systems. Therefore, expression of the aerobactin receptor in the @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ wild type and the iutA mutant was investigated by using heat-extracted preparations of bacteria grown on agar plates with and without the addition of the @sm$ iron @/sm$ chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl (DP). Expression was monitored on MacConkey as well as LB agar supplemented with DP, because the addition of the @sm$ iron @/sm$ chelator is known to induce expression of @sm$ iron @/sm$ transport systems in E. coli. No production of IutA (the 80.9 kDa aerobactin receptor) was observed on Coomassie-stained 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels containing LB agar-recovered bacterial extracts, while abundant IutA was evident in samples from MacConkey plates (Figure 3, panel A). In contrast, the iutA mutant lacked detectable expression of IutA on either media tested. To confirm that aerobactin receptor expression responded to @sm$ iron @/sm$ depletion, the media was supplemented with 200 muM of DP. As shown in Figure 3, panel A, @sm$ iron @/sm$ chelation resulted in the expression of IutA in bacteria grown on LB + DP as well as MacConkey + DP. As expected, the aerobactin receptor was absent in heat extracts obtained from the CSS001 strain (iutA::cat) grown on either of the @sm$ iron @/sm$-depleted media.	3
Many gut commensal bacteria, including clostridial species, Desulfovibrio, Sutterella, @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$, and also bacterial metabolic products, such as @sm$ propionic acid @/sm$, have been associated with behavioral alterations including autism spectrum disorders.	1
Many laboratory-scale experiments showed that the approved antimicrobials such as acidified @sm$ sodium @/sm$, chlorite, cetylpyridinium, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, peroxyacetic acid, and trisodium phosphate could cause up to 5 log reduction of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in chicken meat ( Table 3 ). However, in-plant poultry washers have limited effect on inactivating @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in chicken meat regardless of the efficacy of antimicrobials, water temperature, or washing system. This could be due to several factors including the presence of large molecules in chicken meat (e.g., proteins and lipids) and @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in chicken skin due to changes induced by processing, sensitivity of chicken skin to heat, oxidation and discoloration, initial microbial load of carcasses, number of processed carcasses per min, interaction or masking of antimicrobials (e.g., chlorine) by organic materials in the processing water, water quality and survival of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in recycled processing water, poor sanitation, accumulation of lipids, fecal materials, and/or organics at any point through the processing line.	3
Many of the MAGs encoding the greatest number of CAZymes and with the potential capacity to degrade multiple types of @sm$ glycans @/sm$ were classified within the Bacteroidales order including Alistipes senegalensis, @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$, B.	2
Many other species known to have a positive impact on health increase in R4 and R5: Christensenella minuta positively related with individuals with a lower body mass index,@gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ a @sm$ valeric acid @/sm$ producer, another SCFA with potential to regulate the inflammatory state, as well as the emotional and cognitive status,Oscillospira plauti, strongly related to elevated production of propionate, butyrate, and total SCFA, associated with thin phenotypes,Gemmiger formicilis, another butyrate-producing bacteria, and Victivallis vadensis, an acetate producer.	1
Many pathogens were detected to cause sternal infections in around the chest wounds, mainly @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Antibiotics were administered periodically usually with vancomycin and @sm$ linezolid @/sm$.	3
Many researchers have claimed that the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species are strictly anaerobic, but no research has supported this theory. From our findings, we conclude that the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species are microaerophilic because they can grow in the presence of a certain level of oxygen after the first generation. and reported that L. bifidus and L. acidophilus is closely related, and are variants of the same species. This hypothesis was rejected for lack of evidence. Subsequently, reported that B. bifidum should be included in the order Actinomycetales. Weiss and Rettger later concluded that respect were two different kinds of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$: type 1 is aerobic and unbranched during primary isolation, and type 2 is anaerobic and branched. proposed that all these organisms should be retained in Lactobacillus, but not in Actinomycetales. Established on the hypothesis of Weiss and Rettger, the Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infection and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology adopted this classification. Orla-Jensen then proposed that the genus name should be converted to 'Corynebacterium.' It was reasoned that the use of different growth media for these bacteria may have caused the confusion concerning their nomenclature. These matters remain open today because most of these species are nevertheless brought up to as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, although most are rod-formed. In 1967, using simple microscopy (not SEM), Masami Kojima found that cations play a significant role in the initiation of the bifid form. Nevertheless, we found that cations do not play a substantial role in bifid formation, although they induce the formation of elongated rods. To see the effects of @sm$ NaCl @/sm$ on the bifidobacterial bifid and rod shapes, B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. adolescentis were grown in media containing 0.001-0.01 M salt (Figure 5). Both strains maintained their intrinsic morphologies, although at 0.25 M @sm$ NaCl @/sm$, B.	3
Martinez-Aramburu et al., used @sm$ sodium ferulate @/sm$ and sodium caffeate, previously identified in CFs extracts, as antibacterial agents against S. enterica ser. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes. @sm$ Sodium ferulate @/sm$ generated a bacteriostatic effect on S. enterica ser. Typhimurium at concentrations of 0.3 and 0.6%, and in L. monocytogenes at 0.6%. Meanwhile, same effect was shown by sodium caffeate in both pathogenic bacteria but at a concentration of 0.15%. Likewise, the effect of hydroxycinnamic and cinnamic acids has been tested on the growth of non-pathogenic bacteria such as LAB. Cortes-Rodriguez et al., compared the tolerance of four strains of LAB (@gm$ Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp @/gm$.	3
Members of Clostridium cluster XVIa have been identified as potential secondary bile acid producers, for example, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ and Ruminococcus spp., thus the higher secondary bile acid content in sorghum groups can be attributed to the higher abundance of Ruminococcus spp.. The significant positive correlation observed for the dietary fiber fraction from sorghum with @sm$ deoxycholic acid @/sm$ (r = 0.71; p = 0.0001) and total secondary bile acid (r = 0.56; p = 0.005) contents further backed up the above fact. On the other hand, RS intake was negatively associated with @sm$ deoxycholic acid @/sm$ (r = -0.46; p = 0.025) and total secondary bile acid (r = 0.50; p = 0.014) contents, suggesting the inhibitory effect of RS on secondary bile acid synthesis, which could be the reason behind the negative correlations observed between secondary bile acids and SCFA (Table S3) in this study.	1
Metatranscriptomic studies showed that, while enzymes mediating fermentative @sm$ H2 @/sm$ production were expressed at similar levels, methanogenesis-related transcripts predominated in high methane yield sheep, while alternative @sm$ H2 @/sm$ uptake pathways were significantly upregulated in low methane yield sheep. These other @sm$ H2 @/sm$ uptake pathways could potentially limit CH4 production by redirecting @sm$ H2 @/sm$ uptake away from methanogenesis towards homoacetogenesis (@gm$ Blautia @/gm$, Eubacterium), fumarate and nitrite reduction (Selenomonas, Wolinella), and sulfate reduction (Desulfovibrio). Homoacetogens produce acetate from @sm$ H2 @/sm$ and CO2 and are known to occur in the rumen, but their abundance is generally lower than hydrogenotrophic methanogens. It is likely that methanogens outcompete homoacetogens at the low @sm$ H2 @/sm$ concentrations in the rumen.	2
"Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis has been shown to perform exclusively H2-dependent methanogenesis from methanol, similar to @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ and Methanomicrococcus blatticola. Analyses on the other not-yet isolated strains strongly suggest that they have a similar specialization. Two recent studies indicated that members of this lineage might also use @sm$ methylamines @/sm$ based on the presence of the genes for the corresponding enzymes in the ""Ca."	2
Mice were anesthetized with @sm$ sevoflurane @/sm$ (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) vapor for bacterial intratracheal inoculation. Briefly, each mouse was placed on a plate, the incisor teeth were held with a rubber band, a cannula of 22G x1 gauge with a 125 mm blunt tip was introduced through the trachea, and the animal was inoculated with 250,000 CFU of the MDR strain of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$, suspended in a volume of 100 microL of PBS. Since mice are not a natural host of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$, a high bacterial infecting dose is required to produce a progressive disease.	3
Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of Xylasine (9 mg/kg) and @sm$ Ketamine @/sm$ (36 mg/kg) in PBS before being inoculated i.n. with 2 x 103 or 2 x 104 CFU of B. melitensis, as indicated, 2 x 103 CFU of B. abortus, or 2 x 103 CFU of @gm$ B. suis @/gm$.	3
More reads mapped to the host genome in the ileal @sm$ luminal @/sm$ contents compared to colonic @sm$ luminal @/sm$ contents due to the lower microbial biomass found in the small intestine (Supp. Fig. 4a, Supp Table 5). At the Phyla level, colonic @sm$ luminal @/sm$ contents had significantly more Bacteroidetes, Spirochetes, Actinobacteria, and Euryarchaeota than ileal @sm$ luminal @/sm$ contents (Supp. Fig. 4b, Supp Table 6). Reads that mapped to microbial taxa or functional genes in the ileum were distinct from those obtained from the colon regardless of host health status (Supp. Fig. 4c, d). A total of 46 species were differentially abundant between the ileum and the colon (Supp Table 6). Notably, Lactobacillus amaylovorus and Lactobacillus mucosae were enriched in the ileum while Prevotella copri, Helicobacter macacae, and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$ were enriched in the colon (Supp Table 6).	0
Moreover, another study has also been observed that exercise is directly proportional to the abundance of pathways, which in turn is related to the increased branched chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway, which is important for muscle recovery and increase in @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$, a microorganism that uses H2 in the colon to produce SCFA and ATP. Therefore, it seems reasonable that probiotics can improve athletic performance through the action of probiotics, because athletes can delay fatigue by producing SCFA. In this study, we found that four weeks of SA-03 supplementation significantly decreased one of the fatigue indexes, lactate (Table 2), probably by expediting its conversion to butyrate and then to @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$, which is used in the Krebs Cycle to generate ATP.	1
"Moreover, colonization of bifidobacteria is modulated by ""indigestible"" @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, such as oligosaccharides derived from breastmilk in mammals and plants. These compounds together with the physiology of the host are important drivers of bifidobacterial host co-evolution. It has been shown that certain bifidobacterial species are both host- and niche-specific. Examples of host-specific species are Bifidobacterium breve for humans, Bifidobacterium rousetti for bat and @gm$ Bifidobacterium reuteri @/gm$ for marmoset."	2

Moreover, logistic regression was applied to study the effects of NaCl (1.23-3.95%), @sm$ sodium phosphate @/sm$ (1.31-3.35%), pH (5.4-6.2), and moisture (51-60%) on toxin production by @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ in processed cheese.	3
Most Aeromonas strains isolated from two European rivers were previously found to be resistant to @sm$ nalidixic acid @/sm$. In order to elucidate the mechanism of this resistance, 20 strains of Aeromonas caviae (n = 10), A. hydrophila (n = 5), and @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ (n = 5) complexes, including 3 reference strains and 17 environmental isolates, were investigated.	4
Most of the PGs reconstructed from the 55  C @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ enrichment culture were phylogenetically distant from those of the 35  C cultures (Fig. 3a and Additional file 5), which is likely due to the long-term selective pressure under different temperatures. The most highly transcribed S5.Bin7 was closely related to T. thermosaccharolyticum DSM 571, whose thermophilic starch-hydrolyzing capability has been well documented. However, only GH1 and GH109 from the top 10 GH categories were transcribed from S5.Bin7 (Additional file 6). As with the 35  C cultures, S5.Bin7 in the 55  C culture grown on @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ might play the role of potential fatty acids scavenger as indicated by the highly transcribed acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-FixAB complex and beta-oxidation related gene cluster (Fig. 4 and Additional file 7a). The relatively lower transcription of the @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$-related PG S5.Bin1 (Fig. 2 and Additional file 5) may be because E. harbinense YUAN 3 has a preference for 35  C. However, S5.Bin1 transcribed a more versatile set of GHs compared to the T. thermosaccharolyticum-related S5.Bin7, indicating its possible role as the primary @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ degrader (Additional file 6).	2
Most of these 30 metal complexes were more active against Gram-positive bacteria than against tested Gram-negative bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$. The MIC values reported in the literature for several Ag, Ir, @sm$ Ru @/sm$, Pt, and Mn complexes are shown in Table 2. In comparison to these values, complexes 4-6, in most cases, showed significant activity against E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$, and Acinetobacter baumannii, showing their excellent potential as therapeutic alternatives to Gram-negative bacteria infections.	3
Mouse bone-marrow mesenchymal cells (mBMSCs) were cultivated in minimum essential medium-alpha supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 U/mL) and @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ (100 mug/mL) at 37 C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in six-well culture plates with 2 x 106 cells/well and incubated for 24 h to adhere. Then, the cells were treated with @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ LPS (20 muL/well) with/without SAL (20, 100, 200 muM) for an additional 24 h.	3
Municipal waste contains large amounts of organic matter and a high moisture content, which is conducive to the development of microorganisms and the generation of odorous compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), and @sm$ volatile organic compounds @/sm$ (@sm$ VOCs @/sm$) which are harmful to human health. Landfill bioaerosol can consist of over 200 species of microorganisms, predominately Escherichia, Enterobacter, Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$, as well as many others.	0
Mutants deficient in the synthesis or transport of the siderophores enterobactin and salmochelin (ent and iro) were counter-selected in hu-SRC-SCID mice (Table 1, Figure 1B), consistent with host iron restriction during @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ infection. @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ and S. Typhimurium in vitro growth was measured in LB medium with or without the divalent metal chelator 2,2-dipryridyl (@sm$ DP @/sm$). Although both serovars exhibited reduced growth rates with @sm$ DP @/sm$, @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ growth was more severely restricted, indicating greater sensitivity to iron limitation (Figure 3). Growth of both @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ and S. Typhimurium in @sm$ DP @/sm$-chelated medium was rescued by FeCl3, confirming that iron limitation was responsible for impaired growth in @sm$ DP @/sm$-chelated medium (Figure 3).	3
NHE3 has been found to play an important role in @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production of @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, Escherichia coli and bacterial communities within a dark fermentation fluidised-bed bioreactor .	1
Neijssel and Tempest investigated the influence of nutrient stoichiometry on growth and respiration in @gm$ Klebsiella aerogenes @/gm$ measured in chemostat monocultures. The resulting model describes the relationship between the specific rate of substrate utilization (e.g., O2), the specific bacterial growth rate, and the nutrient limitations under energy- and carbon-rich conditions. Maintenance respiration is part of the model and is at significantly higher levels during @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ limitation than during nitrogen or carbon limitation.	2
Nevertheless, the data imply that O9:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ might not be the ideal antigen for new typhoid vaccines as neither the concentration of anti-O9:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ antibody, frequency of anti-O9:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ ASC nor bactericidal antibody titers at time of challenge correlated with protection in our model. Recent vaccine development for typhoid fever has focused on Vi-conjugate vaccines, but efforts to develop vaccines against invasive NTS strains and against S. Paratyphi have focused on O:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ antigens. In contrast to S. Typhi, none of these pathogens are encapsulated with polysaccharide. For @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ there is evidence from field trials that Ty21a provides cross-protection and in our CHIM there is also evidence that anti-O2:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ IgG titers may correlate with protection against S. Paratyphi A, thus examination of O polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines currently in development in a CHIM is warranted. No such model for invasive NTS is available, and would raise some ethical concerns, to evaluate the role of bactericidal activity mediated by anti-O:@sm$ LPS @/sm$ antibodies observed in vitro and in vivo.	0
Nine species in this genus, including @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, C. intestinalis, C.tanakaei, C.stercoris, C. bouchesdurhonensis, C. phocaeensis, C. ihuae, C. provencensis and C. vaginalis, have been reported before. Several studies demonstrated that Collinsella could modify host bile acids and plasma cholesterol levels. Acetic acid, @sm$ formic acid @/sm$ and lactic acid are the main fermented products of the genus Collinsella.	1
Ninety eight percent (112/114) of the tested Campylobacter jejuni isolates showed the presence of arsB, while none of the 109 @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ contained the gene (Table 3). Interestingly enough, the only two Campylobacter jejuni isolates that did not harbor arsB were also lacking arsC and acr3 and were resistant to roxarsone, arsenate, and arsanilic acid (data not shown). While these are only two isolates but the data might suggest that there is still another unexplored mechanism of @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ resistance in Campylobacter other than arsB. One cannot completely rule out the possibility of the involvement of the cmeABC efflux pump in this regard but this needs to be verified by mutagenesis experiments. Shen et al. (2013) reported a broad distribution of arsB and acr3 in Campylobacter jejuni isolates of different sources and suggested that at least one of these two genes is required for adaptation of Campylobacter to @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ rich niches. The complete absence of arsB from our screened @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ isolates and its presence in 98% of the Campylobacter jejuni isolates, even those harboring acr3, highlight the possibility of the presence of another mechanism in Campylobacter @sm$ arsenic @/sm$ resistance that is yet to be characterized.	4
Ninety percent of cultures identified were Acinetobacter baumannii, 3% were @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$, and 7% were other @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species. Most patients were older (mean age = 67, standard deviation = 12.7), white, and non-Hispanic males. Prior hospital admission (77.2%) and antibiotic exposure (90.8%) in the previous 90 days were common. From 2012 to 2018, these treatments were commonly used in accordance with recommendations from the Sanford Guide: carbapenems (51.6%), aminoglycosides (29.9%), and extended spectrum cephalosporins (31.5%) (Table 1). Supplemental Table  shows specific antibiotics included in these classes. @sm$ Penicillins @/sm$:beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations:were also frequently prescribed (51.1%). Half of cultures received combination anti-@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ therapy (50.0%), and 50.0% received monotherapy (Table 1). Extended spectrum cephalosporins were most commonly used as monotherapy (46.6%), followed by carbapenems (40.0%) and then @sm$ penicillins @/sm$:beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (39.4%). Most combination therapies included an aminoglycoside (78.2%), a polymyxin (67.7%), or a @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ + beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (60.6%).	3
Non-digestible @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ derived from the diet, together with host-produced glycans found in the mammalian gut represent critical energy sources believed to be responsible for the survival and proliferation of many microbial components of the gut microbiota, including bifidobacteria. It is therefore important to know what molecular strategies are employed by members of the gut microbiota to harvest and metabolize complex glycans in order to understand how they underpin their ecological fitness in, and adaptation to, the GIT environment. Furthermore, @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism in the mammalian gut may occur in a concerted manner by various members of the microbiota, including bifidobacteria. Thus, @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ are presumed to be partly responsible for microbiota dynamics in this changeable environment. Genomics has been crucial in revealing the complex interactions and molecular dialogue between a host and its resident (bifido)bacteria, and in unraveling bifidobacterial gut colonization strategies. Recently, all 47 currently recognized bifidobacterial sub/species have been genomically decoded, thus providing the necessary genetic background for this group of bacteria. Here, we describe an analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of representatives of all 47 (sub)species that are currently assigned to the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus, predicting bifidobacterial genome-based strategies for @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism that impact on the overall glycobiome of the gut microbiota and host, while also being pivotal for the establishment of trophic relationships between members of gut microbiota.	2
Non-digestible oligosaccharides fructans (fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin) and @sm$ galactans @/sm$ (galactooligosaccharides or GOS), some types of dietary fiber and sugar alcohols, belong to this conceptual group which has been under constant expansion (for review, see. Prebiotics reach the colon and are fermented by saccharolytic microbes such as beneficial @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus.	2
Non-mucin-degrading bacteria utilise @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and nitrogen sources provided by Akkermansia, promoting their own growth and colonisation. It has been reported that cocultured Akkermansia and non-mucin-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Roseburia and Eubacterium hallii, can mutually promote growth and butyrate production.	2
Non-naive male cynomolgus monkeys (2-5 years @gm$ of @/gm$ age) were group housed in wire-mesh floor cages, except for collection time points during study, and maintained in a controlled temperature and humidity environment (12-h light/dark cycle) with water ad libitum and food provided in amounts appropriate for the size and age @gm$ of @/gm$ the animals twice daily. Animals were fasted the night prior to the study for approximately 16-18 h. On the morning @gm$ of @/gm$ the experiment each monkey was removed from its cage and orally administered vehicle (water) or a spinach suspension (1.3 g/ml in water) for model development (Fig 2B), or vehicle (formulation buffer [13.8%w/v Trehalose, 68 mM Tris, 55 mM HCl, 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]) or a spinach suspension (1.5 g/ml) with @sm$ sodium bicarbonate @/sm$ (1.8 mmol), 13C2-oxalate (50 mg), and formulation buffer (13.8%w/v Trehalose, 68 mM Tris, 55 mM HCl, 1x PBS) or bacteria. Animals were then returned to their cages and a clean urine collection pan was placed at the bottom @gm$ of @/gm$ each cage. Urine was collected at 6 h post-dosing, and the total urine volume was recorded. Cumulative UOx and creatinine levels were measured by LC/MS-MS. To determine the dose-response @gm$ of @/gm$ SYNB8802 in this model, four identical studies conducted on separate days were performed using the same group @gm$ of @/gm$ 12 animals, and the data from all studies were combined. Group assignment was alternated across studies and data was expressed as percent change from the respective vehicle for the day @gm$ of @/gm$ the experiment to minimize the day-to-day impact on the experimental results.	0
Notably, the reduced levels of SCFAs in the CD patients could be well correlated with the lower abundances of multiple SCFA-producing taxa assigned to Firmicutes phylum, such as Faecalibacterium, Clostridium clusters IV and XIVb, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, and Ruminococcus (Figure 1b). ROC analysis showed methylmalonic acid, L-proline, @sm$ L-phenylalanine @/sm$, and L-leucine presenting the highest discrimination value (Figure 2d-g; AUC > 0.9).	0
Noteworthy, these taxa did not represent Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, also a member of Ruminococcaceae, but matched to Ruminococcus bromii and @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ (Figure S16). A possible beneficial property of these Ruminococcaceae is their ability to process nondigestible carbohydrates thereby promoting the production of short chain @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$, which are known to be decreased in inflammatory bowel disease.41 In the study by Vermeire et al, Ruminococcaceae were claimed to be transferred from the donor to two of the patients responding to faecal microbiota transplantation.35 For clarification, the taxa Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus torques, which have been demonstrated to be increased in ulcerative colitis patients37 and have also to be associated with donors leading to no response to faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative colitis42 are not the taxa found in our analysis.	1
Objective: @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ is an emerging hospital-acquired bacterial pathogen. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the antimicrobial resistance and transmission of @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$. Here, we characterized the microbiological and genomic features of a carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ strain harboring the blaNDM-1 gene in China. Methods: K. michiganensis strain 2563 was recovered from the sputum sample of a hospitalized patient with pulmonary infection. Whole-genome sequencing of K. michiganensis strain 2563 was conducted using both the short-read Illumina and long-read MinION platforms to thoroughly characterize the genetic context of blaNDM-carrying plasmid in K. michiganensis 2563. Furthermore, BacWGSTdb server was utilized to perform in silico multilocus sequence typing (MLST), identify antimicrobial resistance genes, and conduct genomic epidemiological analyses of the closely related isolates deposited in the public database. Results: K. michiganensis 2563 was resistant to piperacillin, aztreonam, @sm$ meropenem @/sm$, imipenem, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefazolin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ceftazidime. It belonged to sequence type (ST) 43, and the blaNDM-1 gene was found to be located on the plasmid p2563_NDM (54,035 bp). This plasmid showed remarkable similarity to other blaNDM-1-encoding plasmids found in various Enterobacterium species in the public database. The occurrence of global ST43 @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ was primarily sporadic, and the closest relative of K. michiganensis 2563 was another ST43 isolate 12,084 recovered from China in 2013, which differed by 171 SNPs. Conclusion: Our study reports the genome characteristics of a carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ strain carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in China, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance of this pathogen in clinical settings.	4
Obligately methyl-reducing Methanosarcinales, represented exclusively by the genera Methanimicrococcus and Methanolapillus (; Protasov and Brune, unpublished results), and all members of the order Methanomassiliicoccales lack the methyl branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and are therefore restricted to methylated substrates such as methanol or @sm$ methylamines @/sm$ (e.g.,). Members of the genus @gm$ Methanosphaera @/gm$, which are obligately methyl-reducing methanogens in the intestinal tract of mammals, are absent in arthropods.	2
Observational studies indicate that in a certain proportion of patients, rifampicin/@sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ treatment has no clinical curative effect. Acquired or inherited host factors, like deficiencies in the IFN-Y and IL-12 pathways for macrophage activation, may play a role. Alternatively, antibiotic resistance of certain lineages of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ could be responsible for this lack of response. Therefore major efforts should be made to generate @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ isolates from these patients for susceptibility testing.	4
Of note, it was recently demonstrated that microbiota-induced IL-17R signalling directly induces production of proinflammatory and profibrotic genes in lung epithelial cells and promotes lung fibrosis in a @sm$ bleomycin @/sm$-induced mouse model of IPF. In that study, IL-17B was produced by alveolar macrophages correlating with the significantly elevated IL-17A and IL-17B expression by human BALF cells from IPF patients, compared to controls. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice, as well as mice that are deficient in IL-17A, IL-17B or IL-17E/IL-25, are resistant to @sm$ bleomycin @/sm$-induced fibrosis. Importantly, Yang and colleagues identified outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) expressed by respiratory tract-associated Gram-negative anaerobes, including Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides stercoris and @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$, that induce IL-17A and IL-17B expression, Th17 cell development and neutrophil recruitment to the lungs.	3
Of the 190 metabolites included in the analysis, 12 metabolites, including cinnamoylglycine, hippurate, pipecolic acid, C18:1 lysophosphatidylcholine (@sm$ LPC @/sm$), C18:2 LPC, C18:2 lysophosphatidylethanolamine, 2-aminohippuric acid, 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, hydroxycotinine, N-acetylleucine, trigonelline and glycodeoxycholate/glycoche, exhibited significant associations with the relative abundance of several enterolactone-predicting species, such as M. smithii; @gm$ B. crossotus @/gm$, C.	0
Of the 190 metabolites included in the analysis, 12 metabolites, including cinnamoylglycine, hippurate, pipecolic acid, C18:1 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), C18:2 LPC, C18:2 lysophosphatidylethanolamine, 2-aminohippuric acid, 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, hydroxycotinine, N-acetylleucine, trigonelline and glycodeoxycholate/glycoche, exhibited significant associations with the relative abundance of several @sm$ enterolactone @/sm$-predicting species, such as M. smithii; @gm$ B. crossotus @/gm$, C. symbiosum, and L. bacterium 1.4.56FAA (Fig. 3, Supplementary file Table S3). The 12 metabolites, together with plasma @sm$ enterolactone @/sm$ and the stool microbiome species score, jointly explained 79.8% (95%CI: 17.7%, 98.6%; P = 0.002) of the association between lignan intake and the metabolic risk score.	1
Of the 50 genera, the abundance of 13 genera (Lachnospiraceae, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Desulfovibrio, Clostridia_UCG-014, Eubacterium, Negativibacillus, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Monoglobus, Gastranaerophilales, Acetatifactor, Butyricimonas, and Adlercreutzia) increased and the abundance of eight genera (Faecalibacterium, Prevotella. Lachnospira, Turicibacter, Bilophila, Escherichia-Shigella, Blautia, Muribaculum) decreased in HN model rats compared with their abundance in normal rats. Among these altered genera, many were related to @sm$ urea @/sm$ metabolism. Eubacterium, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, and Clostridia have been reported to possess genes for urease production. The increase in abundance of the above four genera might lead to hyperammonemia due to the @sm$ urea @/sm$ metabolism enhancement in the gut microbiota.	1
Of these, relative abundance of the genus @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ demonstrated highly significant and strongly positive associations with both hippocampal and amygdala volumes. At least two studies have shown significantly enriched @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ in MDD patients compared to healthy controls. As cross-sectional studies are unable to establish causal links between individual taxa and the disorder under investigation, it is unclear whether increased @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ contributed to causing depression, or whether depression of the host brought on the 'blooming' of @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ in the gut. Although we can only postulate, it is possible that an increased abundance of @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ may have conferred protective modulatory function to the brain that resulted in increased amygdala and hippocampal volumes in our cohort of GD patients. For example, the main metabolic end product of @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ is n-Valeric acid, which has a similar chemical structure to the neurotransmitter @sm$ GABA @/sm$. This is a possible pathway by which @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ can mediate beneficial effects on the brain as a psychobiotic agent.	1

On the basis of our results, the rate of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ presence was high in broiler chicken flocks in studied district. Also, our findings showed that there was significant difference between the isolation rates of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ from various areas of the province. As well, all the isolated organisms were susceptible to tetracycline, @sm$ florfenicol @/sm$ and cephalexin. Commonly, the sensitivity pattern of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ strains depends on the source of the strain and routinely used antibiotics in the area.	3
On the contrary, a high-fat diet rich in saturated and trans fats has been associated with a pro-inflammatory state characterized by a reduction in microbial diversity, increased intestinal permeability, and @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ translocation. In our study, individuals with higher consumption of saturated and trans fat had higher amounts of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$, which is a lipolytic genus that secretes extracellular esterase to break down triglycerides and its hydrolyzates.	1
On the day of screening, the medium overlying THP-1 cells was replaced with 100 microl of complete CO2-independent medium (complete CO2IM; Gibco) and the plates were preincubated for 2 h prior to infection in complete CO2-independent medium containing drugs at 33 microM (final concentration; 0.3% @sm$ DMSO @/sm$). @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ cells were resuspended in CO2-independent medium, and each well was infected with 10 microl of a bacterial suspension that yielded an MOI of 10.	3
On the other hand, @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ produces butyrate via the @sm$ malonyl-CoA @/sm$ pathway from various reactions involving acetyl-CoA, which is activated by acetate and is combined with CO2 to form @sm$ malonyl-CoA. @/sm$ Our recent work indicated that the relative content of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ was very low in both HF and HC groups; however, under this condition, fermentation to butyrate seems more likely via the butyryl-CoA/acetate-CoA transferase pathway using acetate as an acceptor.	1
On the other hand, HF diet had significantly enhanced the colonic population of Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Clostridium, among which the increase in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Clostridium were positively correlated to atherosclerotic plaque size, A-FABP and cholesterol. The main elevated Bifidobacteria species in the HF group was B. pseudologum, which is the most predominant @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species in the infant gut but insufficiently understood. Interestingly, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were also found to have a significant positive correlation with @sm$ TMAO @/sm$, the gut microbiota dependent metabolite that predicts CVD risks. With the complete genome of B. pseudologum completed, the functional capacity of the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genera should be further explored for its relationship with atherosclerosis. Clostridium cocleatum, which was significantly elevated in the HF group, can degrade mucin thus could impair the gut barrier and thereby augment systemic inflammation. As for Allobaculum, which correlated positively with atherosclerotic plaque size and MMP-9 in our pilot study, and @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ in others, was also associated with low fat and prebiotics feeding.	1
On the other hand, absolute abundance of @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ and Victivallis vadensis was enriched in CA (Additional file 2: Fig. S14). At predicted bacterial functional levels, results were different, with propionate degradation increased in CNA, while coenzyme M biosynthesis and @sm$ lysine @/sm$ biosynthesis were enriched in CA (Additional file 2: Fig.	0
On the other hand, reported a reduced proportion of lactate-utilising bacteria (@gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ and Selenomonas ruminantium) whereas the population of fungi and some @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ digesting bacteria (R.	2
On the other hand, some species and MAGs, including Bifidobacterium adolescentis, @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, increased significantly, while Blautia hansenii, Clostridium estertheticum, and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased sharply (Fig. 6d and Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, the microbial metabolic pathways of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis, toluene degradation, phenylacetate degradation, and flavin biosynthesis were enriched in subjects receiving the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum treatment for 6 months (Fig.	0
On the other hand, the Ser residues involved in oxazole formation could not be replaced by Thr, and the @sm$ Gly @/sm$ residues that take part in both oxazole and thiazole formation could not be substituted by other amino acids, showing some limitations to the substrate promiscuity. Interestingly, in vitro the streptolysin S synthetase partially installed oxazoles/thiazoles into the microcin B17 precursor as well as into a related precursor peptide from @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ despite the leader peptides of the latter two having only very limited sequence identity with the SLS leader.	0
On the other hand, the indirect oxidation at anode generally requires a concentrated saline solution, thus the molecules and ions (e.g., H2O and Cl-) accumulated around the electrode are oxidized to produce @sm$ chlorine @/sm$-active substances (e.g., @sm$ Cl2 @/sm$, HOCl, and ClO3) and oxygen-active substances (e.g.,  OH, atomic oxygen [O(3 P)], H2O2, O3). The intermediate products play a vital role in transferring electrons between the target substance and the electrode surface to realize the oxidation and removal of the target substance. Since natural water contains @sm$ chloride ions @/sm$, indirect oxidation plays a more significant role in drinking water disinfection. Previous studies confirmed that hypochlorite production by electrolysis from very dilute chloride solutions could be applied for water disinfection purposes. When an iridium-antimony-tin-coated titanium anode and direct current were applied for inactivating MS2 in solutions with sodium chloride addition, better disinfection could be achieved with increases in salt content, contact time, and applied current. @sm$ Chlorine @/sm$-active substances generated by electrochemical device on-site performed a faster inactivation rate of EC, Vibrio cholerae, @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ and MS2 than that of free chlorine.	3
On the other hand, the recommended treatment of localized infections caused by @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ or M. abscessus is clarithromycin combined with one of the injectable agents. Amikacin and cefoxitin are effective against @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M. abscessus, whereas @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ and doxycycline are not.	4
On the other hand, the study documented the sensitivity of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ against @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, meropenem, minocycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Table-2). In contrast, a study in Indonesia reported resistance of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ to @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, meropenem, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, while a study in Nepal displayed a sensitivity of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Whereas in Pakistan, a high resistance rate of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was observed.	3
One @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ isolate had a single mutation rpoB[516:D-G] encoding @sm$ rifamycin @/sm$ resistance and was phenotypically resistant [MIC >32 mg l-1] that was not previously detected in the Day et al.	4
One of the lysogens carried the Stx2a phage (phiO104) of the hypervirulent outbreak strain @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$, which caused a massive disease outbreak in Germany in 2011. The closest related phage is the PA8 phage of pathogenic STEC serotype O157:H7, and it was therefore chosen as the second phage for lysogenizing the same strain. The transcriptomic changes in this study were not under SOS response-inducing conditions. Upregulated genes were mainly @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-, motility, and chemotaxis-related.	0
One of the noteworthy differences between the known @gm$ Methanosphaera @/gm$ species is the capability of Msp. WGK6 to utilize @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ as an electron donor for methanogenesis.	2
One of the striking features of genus @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is the ability to develop antibiotic resistant extremely rapid in response to challenge with new antibiotics. In the present study, strains were resistant to imipenem (5.2%), meropenem (9.75%), piperacilin-tazobactum (18.2%), netilmicin (16.24%), amikacin (14.29%), @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ (74.1%), gentamicin (70.13%), ofloxacin ((42.21%), chloramphenicol (92.20%) [Table 3]. IBL and ESBL were detected 10% and 8% isolates of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ respectively.	4
One particular SCFA, butyrate, has been found to be associated with improved depression-related behaviors in a mouse model by increasing @sm$ serotonin @/sm$ concentration and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression as well as restoring blood-brain barrier impairments. Although alpha-diversity remained unchanged, beta-diversity differences were observed following 14-day supplementation of resistant starch. Specifically, the relative abundances of phylum Actinobacteria increased, genera Bacteroides and Parabacteroides decreased, and resistant starch-degrading species Bifidobacterium faecale and @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$ increased.	1
One way that beneficial microorganisms contribute to mitigate flooding-stress conditions is by their producing ACC deaminase that can convert @sm$ ACC @/sm$ into alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia, thus reducing the levels of ethylene. In addition, beneficial microorganisms such as @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ was reported to mitigate the effect of flooding stress in plants by increasing plants' adventitious roots.	1
One year post-surgery, we investigated the significant associations between differentially abundant taxonomic and functional features with lung function and CPET parameters (FEV1%, TLC%, RV%, workload (Watt), VE, VO2, @sm$ O2 @/sm$/HR, VE/VCO2, VE/VO2) adjusting for cofounders such as COPD and cancer type. In total, 12 bacterial species were significantly correlated (P<0.05) with lung function and CPET parameters. From these species, six were positively correlated with parameters: Veillonella unclassified (@sm$ O2 @/sm$/HR), P. merdae (RV%), L. bacterium 5 1 57FAA (TLC% and RV%), Granulicatella unclassified (VO2), G. sanguinis (VO2) and Eggerthella unclassified (RV%), whereas four species showed negative correlations: @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ (Specific Airway Conductance (sGaw%)), Coprobacillus unclassified (VE and @sm$ O2 @/sm$/HR), Bilophila unclassified (VE and @sm$ O2 @/sm$/HR), and B. intestinihominis (workload and @sm$ O2 @/sm$/HR).	0
Only a few butyrate-producing colon bacteria, encompassing Clostridium butyricum, Coprococcus eutactus, and @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$, are known to use a butyrate kinase to produce butyrate (Louis and Flint,; Vital et al.,). The butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase step involves the consumption of external @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (coming from for instance bifidobacterial carbohydrate breakdown through cross-feeding) as a co-substrate, thereby producing acetyl-CoA and butyrate. The acetyl-CoA produced can be converted via acetyl-phosphate into @sm$ acetate @/sm$, with the production of ATP, by acetate kinase, or recycled into the four-step pathway mentioned above (Falony et al.,).	2
Only five cases of @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ as a cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis have been reported in the literature, with no reports of biofilm formation within the species. METHODS: The aetiological strain was speciated and subspeciated by the VITEK 2 NH card and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CFF biofilm formation was analysed using a crystal violet staining method. C. jejuni National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) 11168 was used as a positive control organism. Strains were incubated statically in Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 0.025% @sm$ sodium deoxycholate @/sm$ for 3 and 7 days at 37 C, microaerobically. RESULTS: The CFF strain formed stronger attached biofilms on polystyrene plates on day 3 (72 hours) than the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 control strain, but were weaker than the control strain on day 7 in Mueller-Hinton broth. Monoculture of this @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ isolate was found to exist in three defined forms of biofilms (attached, air-liquid interface and floccules). CONCLUSIONS: This clinically significant @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ isolate showed considerable biofilm-forming capability, which we suggest conferred a survivalist advantage, contributing to the genesis of infective prosthetic valve endocarditis.	3
Organic acids, namely lactic acid, @sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, and citric acid, are efficient inhibitor against @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp. These organic acids show the maximum biofilm inhibition ranged from 13% to 39% by decreasing the exopolysaccharide production, which is the main component of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ biofilms. Normally, organic acids are the main metabolites that all LAB use for antimicrobial activity and lower the pH in fermented foods. It is suggested that in the presence of organic acids such as lactic acid and @sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, cells may become inactivated and lead to inhibition biofilm formation processes.	3
Other @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species were relatively more abundant in unique age groups: @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ was most prevalent in infants, B. adolescentis in adults, and B. dentium in older adults. Species involved in decomposing and degrading @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ were present across the lifespan, whereas some species that produce butyrate (e.g., Butyricimonas virosa, Anaerostipes butyraticus) were more abundant in younger adults but not nonagenarians.	2
Other animal studies showed that administration of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128), to germ-free mice increased @sm$ serotonin @/sm$ and dopamine production in the striatum compared to controls. In humans, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 38 healthy volunteers. Participants were either given a probiotic formulation containing species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or a placebo for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, participants in the treatment group reported improved mood, reduced depression, and better sleep quality. This effect of probiotic-induced elevation in mood was thought to be due in part to the increased levels of tryptophan and subsequent synthesis of @sm$ serotonin @/sm$ in the brain. Lastly, probiotic supplementation was also shown to decrease constipation severity in PD individuals. In a double-blind randomized trial, 72 PD patients were either given a multi-strain capsule containing eight bacterial strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Enterococcus faecalis, @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$) or a placebo maltodextrin capsule for four weeks.	1
Other flavonoids such as luteolin, lucenin, apigenin, saponarin and vitexin were effective against Gram-negative bacteria @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. An 126 interesting feature of these flavonoids is their potentiating and synergistic behaviour that is observed between active flavonoids as well as combination of flavonoids with antimicrobial agents. Flavonoids like myricetin, datiscetin, kaempferol, qurecetin and @sm$ flavones @/sm$ like luteolin have inhibited growth of MRSA and with myricetin were found effective against VRE as well.	3
Other less common causes of lameness include injuries and foreign bodies, ergotism (due to the toxins ergotoxine, ergotamine, @sm$ ergometrine @/sm$, ergocornine, ergocristine, and ergosine produced by the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea), fescue toxicosis with gangrenous necrosis and sloughing of the hoof (caused by ergovaline and lolitrem B toxins found in endophyte-infected tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, respectively), dermatophilosis or strawberry footrot caused by Dermatophilus congolensis, and post-dipping lameness in adult sheep caused by @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$.	0
"Other notable findings include fusions of a lasso cyclase and RRE, as well as a leader peptidase-lasso cyclase fusion in @gm$ Bifidobacterium reuteri @/gm$ and Acidobacteriaceae bacterium TAA166, respectively. Also noteworthy from Acidobacteriaceae is the precursor, which replaces an ""invariant"" @sm$ Thr @/sm$ at the penultimate position of the leader with Ile. This first identification of a natural lasso precursor lacking the invariant @sm$ Thr @/sm$ reconciles previous reports where conservative substitutions still produced microcin J25 and capistruin."	0
Other phylogenetically diverse HGM species including Acinetobacter baumannii (21 strains), Enterococcus faecalis (62 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (21 strains) and Fusobacterium periodonticum (6 strains) demonstrated high OPVS values due to variability of the @sm$ acetate @/sm$, L-, D-lactate and propionate production phenotypes. Similar metrics were used to assess SCFA phenotype variations at the genus level. Out of 296 analyzed HGM genera, 163 were represented by more than one genome, and 102 of them (~34%) demonstrated various degrees of phenotype variability. Majority of genera with the highest variability of SCFA binary metabolic phenotypes (NVP >3; OPVS >0.95) belong to the Clostridia class from the Firmicutes phylum (Table 2). In contrast, other HGM phyla including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteira and Actinobacteria demonstrate relatively low levels of variations of SCFA production phenotypes. For instance, the Bacteroides and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ genera from the Bacteroidetes phylum were characterized by 5 and 4 variable phenotypes with OPVS values 0.13 and 0.38, respectively. Finally, by comparing cumulative variability metrics between individual SCFA phenotypes across all analyzed HGM genomes, we demonstrated that the L-, D-lactate, formate and propionate production are most variable phenotypes both at the species and genus level, whereas the @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate production phenotypes are more conserved in closely-related species and genera of HGM strains.	1
Other species included Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson, Salmonella enterica serovar Saintpaul, Salmonella group D, Salmonella group C, @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ and Salmonella enterica serovar Aberdeen. The PFGE classification of Salmonella serovars in 2008-2017 demonstrated that S. Enteritidis had 9 PFGE banding patterns and S. Typhimurium 16 with varying degrees of similarity among S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. The results of antibiotic susceptibility tests for the 330 Salmonella strains revealed that @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$ had the highest sensitivity rate (97.5%) followed by levofloxacin and ceftriaxone (81%), and ampicillin/sulbactam (78.2%).	3
Other strongly biased distributions of genes concerning nitrogen-scavenging capacity, such as nucleic acid catabolism, may also reflect the frugivore/folivore food habit of the host, in which the limitation of protein, i.e., @sm$ amino acid @/sm$, availability in the gut is expected (Table S1). Similar trends were observed in B. thermacidophilum genomes; domestic pig isolates apparently lost the genes for endoglucanase, beta-glucosidase, chitinase, an endoxylanase-related protein, beta-mannosidase, and pullulanase in comparison with wild boar isolates. Instead, starch-related digestive enzymes such as maltodextrin glucosidase and alpha-glucosidase were detected only in pig isolates. Wild boar isolates, thus, are apparently associated with fiber-rich omnivorous feeding behavior. In fact, cellulose and xylan comprise the major part of plant carbohydrates of the above-ground part, which comprises 70% of the plant materials consumed by wild boars. Similarly, the unique presence of genes for fiber degradation may explain the association of @gm$ B. moukalabense @/gm$ with a predicted fiber-rich intestinal environment found in wild boar isolates of B. thermacidophilum. The unique presence of genes for nucleic acid utilization in @gm$ B. moukalabense @/gm$ explains its nitrogen scavenging ability under predicted protein- and @sm$ amino acid @/sm$-limited conditions in the intestinal environment. Our results are consistent with the nature of the diets of gorillas and elephants, and to a lesser extent, with that of chimpanzees, which are composed primarily of carbohydrates and are generally limited in protein. The aforementioned differences in genomes between @gm$ B. moukalabense @/gm$ with 7 known genomes of human-associated Bifidobacterium spp. were confirmed by a comparison between @gm$ B. moukalabense @/gm$ and reconstructed meta bifidobacterial genomes.	2
Other taxa have a similar @sm$ LPS @/sm$ biosynthesis pathway. Generally, the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ has a functional pathway to synthesize KDO2-lipid IV(A) but a few of enzymes in the branch pathway to modify the final product vary with taxa (Figure 7).	1
Our results showed that the addition of LC-MVs to a starting culture of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$, H. alvei, C. freundii, S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. epidermidis, E. feacalis reduces the biofilm biomass formed after 24 h of culture by the bacteria. For unknown reasons, we noticed that @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ was the bacteria most affected by the antibiofilm activity of L. casei MVs with an 80% decrease in biofilm biomass. Furthermore, we observed that the earlier MVs were added to @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ cultures, the lower the biofilm biomasses measured after 24 h of growth. This result suggests that LC-MVs do not disrupt already established @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ biofilms. Interestingly, the antibiofilm properties of LC-MVs were not due to bactericidal or bacteriostatic activities against @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$, suggesting a specific mechanism of inhibition. In addition, we showed that a short pretreatment of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ with LC-MVs was enough to reduce the biofilm biomass formed after 24 h of culture, suggesting that the vesicles interact with the bacterial cells. However, the nature of the interactions between LC-MVs and @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ cells are yet to be characterized. Indeed, vesicles could attach to cell surfaces or fuse to the outer membrane of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ as previously described for other bacteria. Taken together, these results suggest that LC-MVs impact the early stage of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ biofilm formation by inhibiting the initial attachment of the bacteria to @sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ plate surfaces.	3
Our team developed an intravaginal ring (IVR) that delivers @sm$ tenofovir @/sm$ (@sm$ TFV @/sm$) (8-10 mg/day) alone or with levonorgestrel (LNG) (20 ug/day). We evaluated the effect of IVRs on the vaginal microbiota, and describe how the vaginal microbiota impacts mucosal PK of @sm$ TFV @/sm$. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We randomized 51 women to @sm$ TFV @/sm$, @sm$ TFV @/sm$/LNG or placebo IVR. We assessed the vaginal microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes prior to IVR insertion and after approximately 15 days of use. We measured the concentration of @sm$ TFV @/sm$ in the cervicovaginal (CV) aspirate, and @sm$ TFV @/sm$ and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) in vaginal tissue at the end of IVR use. The change in relative or absolute abundance of vaginal bacterial phylotypes was similar among active and placebo IVR users (all q values >0.13). @sm$ TFV @/sm$ concentrations in CV aspirate and vaginal tissue, and TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal tissue were not significantly different among users with community state type (CST) 4 versus those with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (all p values >0.07). The proportions of participants with CV aspirate concentrations of @sm$ TFV @/sm$ >200,000 ng/mL and those with tissue TFV-DP concentrations >1,000 fmol/mg were similar among women with anaerobe versus Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (p = 0.43, 0.95 respectively). There were no significant correlations between the CV aspirate concentration of @sm$ TFV @/sm$ and the relative abundances of @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ or Prevotella species. Tissue concentrations of TFV-DP did not correlate with any the relative abundances of any species, including @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$. In conclusion, active IVRs did not differ from the placebo IVR on the effect on the vaginal microbiota. Local @sm$ TFV @/sm$ and TFV-DP concentrations were high and similar among IVR users with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota versus CST IV vaginal microbiota.	0
Out of 45 clones examined from sour cassava @sm$ starch @/sm$ fermentation, the most common species found after five days of fermentation were Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ and Enterobacter sp. @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ was the most prevalent species at the start of the fermentation process, representing 47.6% of the total clones analyzed.	2
Out of the 24 physicochemical properties modeled as machine learning targets, we observed that the presence of six elements (Cd, @sm$ Cu @/sm$, Mn, Mo, P, and Si), especially Cd, @sm$ Cu @/sm$ and Si, have a varying degree of negative impacts on the relative abundance of probiotic taxa in the fecal microbiome data (Fig. 5). Literature pertaining to the exact mechanism of action of these elements in modulating the probiotics activities is very limited. The ability of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus as probiotics to effectively bind Cd as a heavy metal and source of oxidative stress and reduce its toxicity has been demonstrated in both mice and rats. Cd has been shown to significantly reduce Lactobacillus and microbiome abundance in general. Similar to our finding here, Zhang and colleagues show that an increased level of @sm$ Cu @/sm$ decreases the abundance of genus @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ in the rat microbiome while the ability of Faecalibacterium in the microbiome to detoxify arsenic, often found in complexes with @sm$ Cu @/sm$, has been demonstrated.	3
Out of the 30 isolates, 12 isolates were positive in nitrate, oxidase, indole, citrate utilization, MR, motility, glucose, sucrose, mannitol, @sm$ maltose @/sm$, and gelatin hydrolysis agar test (Figure 2A, 2F). V. spp. were also found to be negative in MR, urease, and kingler iron agar test. Hemolytic characteristics of the isolates were also evaluated to differentiate between @gm$ V. cholera @/gm$ and V. parahaemolyticus (Figure 1C, 1D). @gm$ V. cholera @/gm$ are known to cause beta-hemolysis whereas V. parahaemolyticus causes alpha-hemolysis. Based on this characteristic 12 of the initial isolates were classified as @gm$ V. cholera @/gm$ and remaining 18 was classified as V.	2
Over 150 species harbour proteins with CWB2 motifs, including @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$, C. tetani, C. botulinum and many Peptostreptococcaceae (http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF04122). The CWB2 motif, like the SLH motif, is complex and is incompletely conserved. SLH motifs are ~55 amino acids in length, whereas CWB2 motifs are longer, ~100 residues. However, despite performing similar functions, the two motifs share no apparent sequence homology. The @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ cell wall proteins (CWPs) and the S-layer have been implicated as colonisation factors, enabling the bacterium to survive and proliferate in the intestine (Calabi et al., 2002; Merrigan et al., 2013; Spigaglia et al., 2013). In @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ the family of 29 CWPs, including SlpA, the adhesin Cwp66 and the phase-variable protein CwpV all contain three tandem CWB2 motifs (Emerson et al., 2009; Fagan and Fairweather, 2011). Other CWPs contain putative peptidoglycan-modifying activities (e.g. glucosaminidases, glycohydrolases and transpeptidases) or protease activities, e.g. Cwp84 and Cwp13 (Fagan and Fairweather, 2011; Fagan et al., 2011). This family of proteins can be released from the cell using chaotropic agents such as @sm$ guanidinium @/sm$ or urea, confirming their non-covalent anchoring to the cell wall.	3
Over the years in DRC, MDR remained widespread in all serotypes, whereas recent data from Mali, Malawi, South-Africa, Kenya and Ghana showed MDR to be less frequent in @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ or more variable over time. Since 2013, resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin and DCS increased substantially in O5-positive Salmonella Typhimurium in DRC. For the period 2015-2017, a third of them was resistant to ceftriaxone and azithromycin and one out of eight were DCS. @sm$ Pefloxacin @/sm$ disk diffusion methods flawlessly predicted DCS and nalidixic acid performed relatively well. A similar concurrent emergence of ceftriaxone resistance and DCS was seen in Kenya with 15% ceftriaxone resistance and 6% DCS in NTS (on a total of 281 NTS isolates) and in South-Africa with ceftriaxone resistance in 9% of Salmonella Typhimurium (n = 2420) and DCS in around 30% of NTS (Salmonella Typhimurium: n = 2420; @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$: n = 1149), including some fully fluoroquinolone resistant isolates In Mali, 18.2% of @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ were ceftriaxone resistant.	3
Oxalate is endogenously produced in the liver as part of normal metabolism and is also absorbed in the intestine from oxalate-containing foods, especially when unopposed by dietary constituents, such as @sm$ calcium @/sm$, that form an insoluble complex with oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract. A direct link between intestinal bacteria and calcium oxalate kidney stone disease came after the discovery of @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$. This commensal intestinal bacterial species uses oxalate as its primary nutrient source because of the expression of a specialized set of enzymes capable of rapidly degrading high concentrations of the compound and prevent its absorption into circulation. A mechanism by which @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ is able to stimulate oxalate secretion from circulation back into the gut has also been suggested. However, numerous studies have investigated the colonization status of recurrent kidney stone formers and non-stone-forming controls and shown that the absence of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ alone is not causative of stone disease, as some recurrent stone formers are colonized whereas some nonstone formers are not. In fact, studies report colonization rates for patients with urinary stone disease (USD) by @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ ranging from 8% to 100% and for healthy individuals from 11% to 100%, with some studies reporting no significant differences. Furthermore, the presence of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ is associated with significantly lower urinary oxalate in only 55% of the studies that reported these results. Finally, in a recent clinical trial involving patients with primary hyperoxaluria, @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ given as a probiotic daily for 8 weeks failed to reduce urinary oxalate excretion, despite substantial recovery of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ DNA from stool samples. These results suggest that bacterial species in addition to @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ may be important to convey protection against USD.	2
P23, with an MdfA efflux pump from @gm$ Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$, showed a 8-, 8-, 48-, 8- and 4-times increase in tolerance for @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$, florfenicol, thiamphenicol, spectinomycin and minocycline, respectively; and a slight decrease in tolerance for the oxacillin compared to the WT.	4
PSB were identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Pseudomonas synxantha, @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$, Enterobacter hormaechei and Serratia marcescens. These PSB solubilized 25-340 mug ml(-1) of TCP into the liquid phase. The treatment of plants with individual PSB or mixture of these increased soil available @sm$ P @/sm$, @sm$ P @/sm$ uptake in plants and plant growth. The increase in aloin-A content due to higher plant biomass and unit biomass production was 673%, 294%, 276%, 119% and 108% in plants treated with a PSB consortium, P. synxantha, S. marcescens, @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$, and E.	2
PURPOSE: : To report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$, Streptococcus oralis, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. in a patient who underwent collagen cross-linking for keratoconus. METHOD: : Case report. RESULT: : A 32-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of a painful red eye, occurring 3 days after he had undergone a collagen cross-linking with @sm$ riboflavin @/sm$ and UV-A on his left eye for keratoconus. He admitted to removing his bandage contact lens and cleaning it in his mouth before reapplying it in his eye. On presentation, a severe keratitis with an 8-mm epithelial defect and 360-degree ring infiltrate was found. Culture results from his contact lens were positive for @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ and S.	3
PURPOSE: This report describes the effect of rhamnolipids (RLs), an amphiphilic biosurfactant produced by the bacterium @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$, on the integrity and permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers. METHODS: We measured the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability of [(14)C]mannitol across Caco-2 cell monolayers upon incubation with 0.01-5.0% v/v RLs as a function of incubation time (30, 60, 90, and 120 min). We also studied the recovery of RL-treated Caco-2 cell monolayers upon incubation with Kaempferol, which is a natural @sm$ flavonoid @/sm$ that promotes the assembly of the tight junctions.	1
PWY-6590 (pyruvate fermentation), PWY-5676 (@sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ fermentation), and CENTFERM-PWY (pyruvate fermentation) were enriched in participants with LTN. PWY-5022 (butanoyl-CoA fermentation) showed no difference in its distribution ( Figure 4A ). PWY-5676 was the main butanoate producing pathway, comprising 64.96% (range 2.81-100 00%, standard deviation 20.13%) of total butyrate productivity ( Figure 4B ). The butyrate producers enriched in the LTN group included @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$, Coprococcus catus, Roseburia hominis, and Eubacterium eligens, which were also positively correlated with the butyrate producing pathways ( Figure 4C  and  Table S6 ) (p < 0.001, Spearman's correlation test).	1
Parapedobacter (p < 0.04), Bacteroides (p < 0.01), @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ (p < 0.09), and Porphyromonas (p < 0.01) were dominant genera in the HS group. Paraprevotella was first identified in human faces and was found to produce succinic acid and acetic acid as end products of glucose metabolism in cattle; it has also been found in pig and human feces. It can utilize xylan as a growth substrate. It has been reported that Paraprevotella in the rumen of cattle fed with cornstalk (@sm$ CS @/sm$) may have some beneficial effects on @sm$ CS @/sm$ NDF degradation.	2
Paratyphi A and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ respectively. Interestingly, both S. Typhi and S. paratyphoid A isolates were highly susceptible to gentamicin, @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$, cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.	3
Paratyphi B carrying Arg47Ser and Asp87Gly and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ carrying Asp147Gly and Ser83 Phe. Arg47Ser and Asp147Gly are novel mutations and their contribution to conferring @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ resistance is not yet clear. One of the S. Paratyphi A isolates with high @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ resistance, i.e., an MIC of 32 mg/L, has a double mutation in GyrA, Ser83Phe and Asp87Gly. This isolate was found to be negative for the presence of PMQR genes but the contribution of efflux was not investigated. An earlier study of an S. Paratyphi A isolate from Japan showed an unusually high @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ resistance with an MIC of 128 mg/L. The basis of this very high resistance was identified as double mutations in GyrA, Ser83Phe and Asp87Asn, together with a Glu84Lys mutation in parC. Recently, S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B isolates from Jiangsu Province of China have been reported to carry many novel mutations in GyrB, ParC and ParE (Table S1). However, their relevance for @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ resistance awaits further study.	4
Pathogens included: Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC 19606), Candida albicans (ATCC 24433), Escherichia coli (ATCC 29214), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51575), @sm$ methicillin @/sm$-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300), @sm$ methicillin @/sm$-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145). Representative normal skin flora included: @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ (@gm$ ATCC 15309 @/gm$), Corynebacterium striatum (ATCC BAA1293), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 49732), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14900).	0
Pediococcus acidilactici FAM18098 and nine other @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains (Table 1) were incubated in a broth in which AABA formation can be detected to test if AABA formation was strain- or species-specific. Additionally, nine strains of P. pentosaceus were included in this analysis. The analysis of the free amino @sm$ acids @/sm$ after 3 days of incubation showed that AABA and alanine was formed in all of the samples with @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ (Fig. 1). Concomitantly, serine and threonine were degraded. In addition, the concentration of phenylalanine was on average 0.2 mM lower than in the non-inoculated medium (data now shown). The strains FAM13881 and FAM18987 produced less alanine and AABA in comparison to the other @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains. Accordingly, the levels for serine and threonine were higher in both strains compared to the other @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains.	1
Penicillin resistance mediated by beta-lactamase activity has been reported previously in the anaerobic intestinal spirochaete @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$, and a novel class D beta-lactamase (OXA-63) hydrolysing oxacillin was described recently in a resistant human strain from France. In the current study, 18 @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains from Australia and Papua New Guinea were tested for @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$ and oxacillin susceptibility, and investigated for the presence of the class D beta-lactamase gene blaOXA-63 using PCR. PCR products were amplified from seven human and four porcine strains that were penicillin resistant, but not from seven penicillin-sensitive strains. Sequence analysis of the whole gene amplified from seven of the resistant strains from humans and pigs revealed only minor nucleotide differences among them, but there were significant differences compared with blaOXA-63. The predicted amino acid sequence of the enzyme from all seven strains had the same key structural motifs as the previously reported OXA-63, but two variants with 94-95% identity with OXA-63 were identified. OXA-136 had an additional amino acid and 12 other consistent amino acid substitutions compared with OXA-63. OXA-137 had the same differences compared with OXA-63 as OXA-136, but had an additional amino acid substitution at position 16. No structures consistent with integrons or transposons were found in the nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of blaOXA-136 in partially sequenced B. pilosicoli strain 95/1000, and the GC content (25.2 mol%) of the gene was similar to that of the whole genome. The gene encoding OXA-136 from @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strain Cof-10 conferred penicillin resistance on Escherichia coli. This study shows that penicillin resistance in human and porcine @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains from Australia is associated with the production of two variants of OXA-63, and that susceptible strains lack the genes encoding OXA-63 or the variants.	4
Phospholipids are converted into arachidonic acid and then into @sm$ prostaglandins @/sm$. Certain vaginal bacteria such as @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$ may ascend to the uterus and secrete phospholipase A2 to act on uterine membrane phospholipids, resulting in additional @sm$ prostaglandin @/sm$ release. @sm$ Prostaglandins @/sm$ cause uterine muscle contractions, ischemia, hypoxia, and sensitization of nerve endings, all of which contribute to menstrual pain. @sm$ Prostaglandins @/sm$ may get into the circulation and may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, bloating, change in bowel frequency). In addition to promoting the release of @sm$ prostaglandins @/sm$, certain vaginal bacteria can stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines interact with each other and with @sm$ prostaglandins @/sm$, potentially amplifying inflammation and dysmenorrhea symptoms.	1
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed this organism to be a member of the genus @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, with the closest relatives being @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ (95 % sequence identity) and Megasphaera cerevisiae (95 % sequence identity). Growth was observed between 30 and 50  C and between pH 5.0 and 9.0. AJH120T utilized a variety of carbon sources, including succinate, gluconate, fructose, ribose and pyruvate, as well as many individual amino acids. The DNA G+C content for the genome sequence of AJH120T was 52.1 mol%. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), average nucleotide identity (ANI) and average amino acid identity (AAI) between AJH120T and close taxonomic relatives, indicated divergence consistent with the strain representing a novel species. The major fatty acid methyl esters of the organism were C12 : 0, C14 : 0 3-OH, C18 : 1omega9c, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1omega9c. AJH120T was able to produce several short chain fatty acids, including butyrate, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and isovalerate. Together, these data indicate that AJH120T represents a novel species within the genus @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$.	1
"Polyethylene glycol alloadsorption technique was performed to adsorb free IgG autoantibodies contained in @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$ (@sm$ DTT @/sm$)-treated serum to rule out any underlying clinically significant alloantibody. To rule out underlying infectious etiology causing AIHA, test for mycoplasma pneumonia, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), tuberculosis (TB), @gm$ treponema pallidum @/gm$ (@gm$ TP @/gm$), HIV, and hepatitis-B and C were performed in the microbiology department following specific departmental protocols. Briefly HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV, and @gm$ TP @/gm$ were performed by chemiluminescence assay (ARCHITECT I 1000SR, Abbott Diagnostics, USA). EBV and mycoplasma tests were done by enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (VIDAS, Biomerieux, France)and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Biotron Healthcare, India), respectively. TB was ruled out using culture and PCR (Biotron Health care, India) techniques. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody tests to exclude rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus were performed in the immunology laboratory using nephelometry (BN ProSpec System, Siemens Healthineers, India) and HEp-2 cell substrate-based indirect immunofluorescence assay. ""Best match"" blood units were selected by Gel CAT using @sm$ DTT @/sm$-treated serum and transfused to patients as per discussed before."	0
Post-operation, she experienced a fever, and a culture of blood revealed metallo-beta-lactamase-producing @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$. For treatments with @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ antimicrobial agents, a therapeutic drug monitoring-based dosing design can lower the risk of adverse events and enable appropriate treatment. Key Clinical Message. When @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ antimicrobial agents are administered for MBL-producing bacteremia, prescription suggestions based on TDM by antimicrobial stewardship team can reduce the occurrence of adverse events and enable appropriate treatment.	3
Presumably some of these family members correspond to bacteria whose growth was promoted by cell wall polysaccharides and was not inhibited by apple @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$. Ruminiclostridium genus, which was highly stimulated, is represented by very efficient polysaccharide-degrading bacteria and could belong to this category. Although no procyanidin-cell wall linkage effect was observed when performing global analyses, pairwise comparisons allowed us to show that @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ and Gordonibacter genera, although at very low levels in the initial fecal microbiota, increased specifically with the Mno matrix. This result is not surprising since these two genera have been shown to metabolize dietary @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$. @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, first described as an equol-forming bacterium from soy isoflavones, was recently shown to metabolize flavan-3-ol monomers i.e., (-)-epicatechin, (-)-catechin, and (+)-catechin by performing C-ring cleavage. Gordonibacter genus is also strongly linked to the metabolization of @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ with one species, Gordonibacter faecihominis, capable of dehydroxylating (+)-catechin derivatives.	2
Prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ strains was 56.6% in standard, 51.3% in export and 80% in free-range broilers. In standard and export productions, the most often isolated species was C. jejuni, whereas @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ was predominant in free-range production. 53.8% samples collected from pigs contained @gm$ C. coli @/gm$. The sensitivity of strains to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, @sm$ enrofloxacin @/sm$ (broilers) or ciprofloxacin (pigs), tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. In broilers, the percentages of resistant strains were, respectively 22, 25, 17, 57, 0.3 and 0% for C. jejuni and 29, 43, 40, 70, 31 and 0% for @gm$ C. coli @/gm$. In pigs the percentages of resistant @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ were, respectively 12, 21, 12, 83, 65 and 0%.	3
Previous research has shown that several @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains possessed the putative genes for expressing extracellular beta-endoxylanase and beta-xylosidase as well as alpha-arabinofuranosidase, conducive to hydrolyze complex arabinoxylan backbones. Hence, the observed reduction in xylo- and arabino-oligosaccharide concentration in B. bifidum spent media may be attributed to their depolymerization into xylose and @sm$ arabinose @/sm$, as facilitated by the extracellular enzymes. Accordingly, the fermentation media at 120 h displayed an increase in xylose concentration by 1 and 35% in HP-HOS and SG-HOS, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4). Fermented SP-HOS media, after 120 h, also showed an increase in @sm$ arabinose @/sm$, glucose, and mannose concentrations by 9, 13, and 14%, respectively.	2
Previous studies dealing with antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the genus @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ are scarce, and disc diffusion and E-test are usually applied. However, MIC testing using broth microdilution is neglected. Lack of standardization, absence of quality standards for the media used and variety in breakpoints due to cultivation with and without CO2 make detection of AMR in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ a considerable challenge. According to our results, @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ has maintained its susceptibility to doxycycline, new glycylcycline tigecycline, @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$ (gentamicin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and rifampicin to some extent. Rifampicin stays in combination with others, the main common treatment option of brucellosis in humans. Susceptibility of 100% of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ strains to doxycycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin was also reported in isolates from Saudia Arabia, Turkey, China, and Norway.	3
Previous studies have reported positive associations between RE and the following associated factors: older age, male gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, and hiatal hernia, and a negative association between RE and @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ (@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$) infection. Obesity is also known to play an important role in RE. Further evidences have demonstrated that abdominal obesity, which is the core component of metabolic syndrome (MetS), may be a stronger predictor of RE than obesity. MetS is generally recognized to be a combination of metabolic abnormalities, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and elevated @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ (@sm$ TG @/sm$).	0
Previous studies showed that silver nanoparticles loaded with @sm$ 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid @/sm$ showed strong antifungal activity against Candida albicans or antibacterial activity against human bacterial pathogens. Few studies had shown the antimicrobial activity of cyanogenic glucoside, such as its antibacterial effect against Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), Corynebacterium spp., E. coli, and @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$.	3
Previous studies using culture and molecular methods have also observed that dentinal caries lesions can be classified according to the relative abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$. A pyrosequencing study showed that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was one of the 8 genera that increased significantly in cavitated dentin lesions. Another study using pyrosequencing to evaluate the microbiota associated with dentinal caries revealed that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species were one of the most abundant, and the species L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ were dominant in acidic areas of the carious dentin. Lactobacilli are acidogenic and aciduric bacteria that have been strongly associated with caries. They are not high producers of extracellular @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and, because of their low adherence to smooth tooth surfaces, lactobacilli are more frequent in retentive areas, such as cavities.	1
Previously published data related to microbial function also revealed that 16 of the 37 bacteria species that were significantly more abundant in the high-altitude populations were associated with dietary digestion and energy metabolism of the host (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1), including five that were shown to have the ability to produce @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (Akkermansia muciniphila, Candidatus Formimonas warabiya, @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$, Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, and Ruthenibacterium lactiformans).	1
Previously, we showed that in the rhizobacterium @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ UW5, the TyrR regulon includes the ipdC gene encoding the enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase which converts indole-3-pyruvate to @sm$ indole-3-acetaldehyde @/sm$, a key step in the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthetic pathway.	1
Primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) are synthesized in the liver, conjugated to @sm$ taurine @/sm$ or glycine and released into the GI tract. Gut microbiota deconjugate these primary bile acids to liberate @sm$ taurine @/sm$ or glycine. Deconjugated bile acids are further chemically modified by a variety of chemical processes including oxidation, dihydroxylation, esterification, etc., to produce secondary bile acids. The enzymatic capacity for secondary bile acid formation is distributed across various bacterial species. For example, B. fragilis and B. vulgatus perform deconjugation, and dihydroxylation is carried out by Clostridium spp. and @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ spp., while esterification is performed by Bacteroides spp., @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ spp.	2
Primary interactions with inflammation status included links to epidermal integrity proteins (SCEL and IVL), as well as metabolites, including @sm$ xanthine @/sm$ and carbohydrates hexose and hexose-phosphate. Primary microbiome interactions included anaerobic taxa Prevotella and Ruminococcus. A second major node identified was L. crispatus, which was linked to L. iners and @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$. L. crispatus was also directly linked to the inflammatory cytokine MIP-1alpha, and the immune cells APCs, neutrophils, and CD4+ T cells. Succinate is a metabolite that has been associated with BV, and was linked to both L. crispatus and @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$ in this network.	0
Probes were generated based on characterized gene sequences from @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$. Yoda-generated candidate probes were then screened for secondary structure with hybrid-ss-min, from the UNAFold package using 60 C as the folding temperature, @sm$ Sodium @/sm$ concentration of 0.6 mol/L and DNA for the -n option (defaults for all the other parameters ).	0
Probiotics (e.g., species of Lactobaccillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$) often contain a BSH activity, which is related to cholesterol-lowering effects in plasma. Some probiotics can also increase BA synthesis via direct inhibitory actions on FXR and SHP. In addition, probiotics seem to be associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects and enhanced endothelial function in arteries. Besides the genera Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, lactic acid bacteria has been shown to have both fermentation productivity and antioxidant properties. Moreover, as previously described, derivates from @sm$ LCA @/sm$ can modulate T cell subsets (Figure 2):3-oxoLCA and isoLCA inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells, while iso-alloLCA increases the differentiation of Tregs. Higher intestinal levels of these secondary BAs may be beneficial in controlling gut immune homeostasis and reducing systemic inflammation. Screening bacteria in human stool samples for their ability to convert @sm$ LCA @/sm$ into its derivates (3-oxo-, iso-, and iso-allo-LCA) using UPLC-MC traces, is a useful tool to select bacterial species as potential probiotics. Paik et al. revealed that species Eggerthella lenta and Ruminococcus gnavus are able to convert @sm$ LCA @/sm$ to 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA, while species Bacteroides fragilis convert 3-oxoLCA to isoLCA.	2
Probiotics also have the ability to produce @sm$ gamma-aminobutyric acid @/sm$ (@sm$ GABA @/sm$), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In addition, @sm$ GABA @/sm$ exhibits anti-anxiety and tranquilizing effects. Certain strains, such as Latilactobacillus curvatus K285 isolated from gat-kimchi, L. pentosus 9D3 isolated from Thai pickled weed, L. plantarum KB1253, and Companilactobacillus allii WiKim39 and Lactococcus lactis WiKim0124 isolated from kimchi have demonstrated a strong ability to produce @sm$ GABA @/sm$, making them potential starter cultures for producing functional foods. Mannitol, a 6-carbon sugar alcohol naturally present in microorganisms and plants, is slowly absorbed in intestinal tracts and does not increase blood sugar levels. Strains such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides SKP88 and @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ SKP92 isolated from pa (green onion)-kimchi can convert fructose to mannitol.	1
Probiotics directly inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines or indirectly reduce the abundance of the strains involved in proinflammatory processes, maintain the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell wall and lower @sm$ LPS @/sm$ levels to decrease inflammatory reactions. Specifically, Lactobacillus plantarum may increase insulin sensitivity by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha). We have found that administration of probiotics can markedly decrease the abundance of @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Collinsella aerofaciens, both of which are engaged in the proinflammatory response; the former can activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex signalling to induce inflammation, and the latter is connected with the production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 A. Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus casei are able to reduce intestinal permeability and improve intestinal epithelial cell dysfunction due to glucose transporter type 2 receptor upregulation in a dysglycaemic environment. @sm$ LPS @/sm$ is a constituent of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and stimulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by binding to the TLR4/CD14 complex. However, probiotic supplementation was observed to markedly lower the abundance of some Gram-negative bacteria in the gut, thus reducing @sm$ LPS @/sm$ levels.	3
Probiotics supplementation significantly reduced @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ in the nAAC mice (Fig. 6H). An additional 2 weeks of probiotics gavage reduced plasma @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ in the GF mice transplanted with nAAC feces (Fig. 6I). Metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics joint analyses disclosed strong positive correlations among plasma @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ and Acutalibacter muris, Clostridium, and Firmicutes. These microbial taxa were abundant in the nAAC mice. @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$, Anaerofustis stercorihominis, and E. faecalis were abundant in the probiotics treatment group and were negatively correlated with @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ (fig. S22). Thus, these bacterial species might possibly play a role in reducing plasma @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ and are worth further mechanism research. The aforementioned omics study demonstrated that probiotics effectively reconstruct the gut microbiota and reduce its @sm$ Kyn @/sm$ metabolite content.	1
"Production of the SBAs, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and @sm$ lithocholic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ LCA @/sm$), by removing the 7alpha/beta-hyroxy group from PBAs, has been discovered in several strains, including C. scindens, C. hiranonis and C. hylemonae. Different from oxidation and epimerization, 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation is limited to free BAs and is a multistep pathway carried out by several BA-inducible (bai) genes. Recently, @gm$ Faecalicatena contorta @/gm$ S122 (S122), which is more prevalent and abundant than C. hiranonis or C. scinden in humans, was shown to harbor putative bai operons and could convert cholic acid (CA)/chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to DCA/@sm$ LCA @/sm$. Moreover, Eggerthella lenta is capable of oxidizing and epimerizing BA hydroxyl groups as revealed by several functional studies while ""bai-like genes"" have been identified in E. lenta. Recently, bai genes were identified in E. lenta, however, without any further functional characterization. Collectively, it remains inconclusive whether E. lenta could produce DCA or @sm$ LCA @/sm$."	1
Promisingly, after three hours in simulated gastric juice, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ DSM 23964 showed a 90.0% survival rate, and after four hours in simulated intestinal juice, it had a 96.0% survival rate. By lowering cholesterol levels, inducing satiety, and even having an anticarcinogenic impact, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$' synthesis of short-chain fatty acids and the fermentation of dietary @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ are linked to benefits for human health.	2
Propionaldehyde can be converted into propanol, by propanol dehydrogenase (PduQ) or into @sm$ propionyl-CoA @/sm$, a precursor of propionate, by CoA-dependent propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP). Both pduP and pduQ genes are present in the R. gnavus ATCC 29149 genome, suggesting that both propanol and propionate can be produced via the propane-1, 2-diol pathway in this bacterium (Reichardt et al., Crost et al.). Acetate, formate, and ethanol were produced in increasing amounts by R. gnavus ATCC 29149 when in monoculture with glucose or co-culture with @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ on starch, while neither butyrate or propionate were detected in the growth conditions tested (Crost et al.).	0
Propionate can also be synthesized from @sm$ acrylate @/sm$ with lactate as a precursor through the @sm$ acrylate @/sm$ pathway by Megasphaera elsdenii and Coprococcus catus, and the propanediol pathway by Salmonella spp., Roseburia inulinivorans, and Ruminococcus obeum. The third major SCFA, butyrate, is generally formed by condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA via either butyrate kinase or the butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase route by bacteria such as @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$ and Coprococcus eutactus.	1
Propionate is produced by many different gut microbes, including Veillonella spp., @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ and Salmonella spp.. Propionate-producing microbes use either the propanediol pathway from deoxyhexose sugars, such as fucose and rhamnose, the succinate pathway by converting succinate to methylmalonyl-CoA, or the acrylate pathway, in which lactate is reduced to propionate. Valerate, a rather poorly studied metabolite, can be produced by Clostridium cluster I and its fermentation involves propionate coupling with ethanol. @sm$ Valproate @/sm$ is a branched SCFA generated from valerate. @sm$ Valproate @/sm$ is not naturally generated upon microbial fermentation, but rather is synthetically produced. @sm$ Valproate @/sm$ is extensively used clinically for the treatment of epilepsy and seizures, but has also been investigated as an adjuvant agent for many other pathologies, such as cancer or HIV therapy, based on its action as an HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor.	0
Propionibacterium propionicum and @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, two of the identified commensal microorganisms, were regarded to activate Ro60-specific CD4+ memory T cells in lupus patients. Third, dysbiosis of gut microbiota may cause the alteration in intestinal permeability. This change in permeability allows some bacterial products (such as @sm$ lipopolysaccharides @/sm$, beta-glucans) to spread into blood vessels and tissues and stay in tissues like synovium or uvea, which could trigger the immune response to induce arthritis or uveitis.	0
Protective bacterial species, such as @gm$ lactobacillus @/gm$ (e.g., @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$, L. iners, L. jensenii, L. gasseri), produce @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ and other bacteriostatic compounds that prevent the overgrowth of other, more pathogenic microbiota.	1
Proteins with short hydrophilic loops allow solubilization of a broad range of drugs, noxious lipophilic compounds that comprise DNA intercalating agents, lethal metabolites such as nicotine, and @sm$ polyamine @/sm$ compounds such as spermidine (Bay et al.,; Bay and Turner,). There are several reports indicating the active role of these family members in developing resistance toward different substrates:like in @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$:AbeS transporter is found to be responsible for the transportation of ethidium, benzalkonium, and acriflavine, which simultaneously increases resistance toward amikacin (Lytvynenko et al.,; Lin et al.,).	4
Protopine and allocryptopine, isolated from aerial parts of Hypecoum erectum L., showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC 125 mug/mL) against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and low antibacterial activity (MIC > 500 mug/mL) against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$. @sm$ Tetrandrine @/sm$ and demethyltetrandrine, two bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids isolated from Stephania tetrandra S. Moore, related to calafatine, showed in vitro anti-MRSA and antibiotic synergistic effects with four antibiotics: ampicillin, azithromycin, cefazolin and levofloxacin. Also, reticuline isolated from Annona salzmanni D.C. tested against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed to be inactive.	0
Protozoan concentrations increased in S ponies at 92 gd, which could have had an important physiological consequence, especially in host @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism (Dougal et al.,), or have an unclear clinical significance. It could be that strongyle infection makes the large intestine a more suitable environment for commensal protozoa. It has been observed in chimpanzees that a positive correlation between intestinal parasites and commensal protozoa arose from complex interactions mediated by the host immune response and competition among taxa (McLennan et al.,). In horses, Guiris et al. have shown that helminths cohabit with commensal protozoa in the gastrointestinal tract in natural conditions. In line with the seemingly symbiotic relationship between H. polygyrus and bacteria from the family Lactobacillaceae in mice (Reynolds et al.,), it could be speculated that strongyle and protozoa may contribute to each other's success in the ecological niche of the equine intestines. Variations in protozoan concentrations might also reflect host adaptations for nutrient accessibility and acquisition during infection. In fact, protozoa have an important role in pectin degradation although have a limited role in cellulose digestion (Julliand et al.,). The key contribution of @gm$ Treponema @/gm$, a non-pathogenic @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolizing bacteria (Han et al.,), to the co-occurrence network of S ponies at 92 gd also suggests that compensatory mechanisms were induced to degrade fiber and supply the host with micro and macronutrients needed to face the infection.	2
PrtP was activated by @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. It also was inhibited by Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and, to a lesser extent, H-D-Tyr-L-Pro-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (YPRCK) and was relatively insensitive to EDTA and leupeptin. Neither @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 25285 @/gm$(pFD340-prtP) cells nor the CHAPS extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin.	3
Published data show that neutrophils migrating toward fMLF, C5a or LTB4 arrest immediately after ingestion of yeast @sm$ zymosan @/sm$ and do not exhibit further forward or reverse migration. Our experimental design differed as we assayed chemotaxis 4 and 8 hours after phagocytosis. Under these conditions, prior infection with live @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ but not live F. tularensis or formalin-killed @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ inhibited chemotaxis toward fMLF as indicated by EZ-TAXIScan  imaging.	3
Published research suggests that PE causes certain changes in the rumen microflora and beneficial changes in rumen @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism. The inhibitory effect of PE on hydrogenation has been reported before. A study by suggested that PE potentially inhibits BH by acting on microorganisms. Several bacteria involved in BH function were identified: B. fibrisolvens, B. proteoclasticus, and @gm$ B. crossotus @/gm$.	2
Purified suspected @gm$ Salmonella typhi @/gm$ appeared as 2-3 mm circular greyish white colonies on solid nutrient agar media and gave pink colonies (on MacConkey media), while suspected Proteus mirabilis appeared creamy (on nutrient solid agar), colorless colonies (on MacConkey media). The examination of the biochemical reaction of @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ exhibited positive results in the case of catalase, MR (methyl red), and @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reduction test (Table 2), while it had a negative reaction against citrate, oxidase, and urease test.	1
Putrescine is also a precursor of @sm$ spermidine @/sm$ and spermine. The polyamines putrescine, @sm$ spermidine @/sm$, spermine, and cadaverine are essential components of living cells, and play an important role in the formation of nucleic acid, protein synthesis, and membrane stability. Of the various biogenic amines detected in a variety of fruits, juices, and vegetables, putrescine was the most common. Kalac reported that putrescine was commonly found in frozen spinach puree (average 12.9 mg/kg), ketchup (average 52.5 mg/kg), concentrated tomato paste (average 25.9 mg/kg), and frozen green pea (average 46.3 mg/kg). The putrescine content of fermented foods and beverages was found to be 9 mg/kg (3-25 mg/kg, n = 28) in sherry, 154 mg/kg (6-550 mg/kg, n = 8) in sauerkraut, 19 mg/kg (1-71 mg/kg, n = 8) in Dutch cheese, and 52 mg/kg (1-190 mg/kg, n = 14) in fermented sausage. Furthermore, the putrescine found in the traditional cheeses made from ewe's whole milk in Sardinia, Italy, increased to 1658 mg/L during ripening. @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spps. (i.e., @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ CCDM 94, B. adolescentis CCDM 223, B. animalis ssp. lactis CCDM 239, 240, 241, and 374, B. bifidum CCDM 559, and B. longum CCDM 569) are known to produce cadaverine, putrescine, tyramine, and @sm$ spermidine @/sm$.	1
Pyruvate is known to be biosynthesized by the @sm$ glucose @/sm$-metabolizing glycolytic pathway in all bacteria. However, the results of the present analyses suggest that only butyrogenic commensals flux some of this pyruvate to bring about butyrate production. Also, it was observed that gut commensals like Flavonifractor and few strains of Lachnospiracea possessed not only pyruvate pathway, but also other butyrate biosynthetic pathways (Figure 3A). In addition, Figure 3A shows that known gut commensals like @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ and Oscillibacter (although not observed in any of the datasets under study) also show the presence of pyruvate pathway.	2
Quantification of nitric oxide (NO) and @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$) was based on fluorimetric quantification using the permeable fluorescent probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and CellRox Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen, USA), respectively. Briefly, macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates (7 x 104 macrophages/well) and infected with WT @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, DeltaabcBA, or DeltavirB2, and incubated for 8, 24, and 48 h, under the same conditions as described above.	3
RAW 264.7 cells were plated at 1 x 107 cells per well in 10-cm dishes and then challenged with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$-GFP at an MOI of 50. At 3 hpi, cells were washed with 1x @sm$ PBS @/sm$ solution and harvested.	3
RESULTS: Both of conventional methods and PCR identified the 12 Brucella suspicious strains as @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ biotype 3. BCSP31-PCR identification results showed that a specific DNA bands (223 bp) were detected in all the 12 strains and positive control samples with no DNA band in negative samples. AMOS-PCR amplified a 731 bp-DNA bands in all the 12 strains, with 731 bp, 498 bp and 275 bp in M5, S2 and A19 strains, respectively, and no DNA band was detected in the negative control samples. PFGE analysis showed that 12 Brucella isolates from patients and goats showed consistent PFGE patterns with the digestion of restriction enzyme Xba @sm$ I. @/sm$ CONCLUSION: The epidemic species/type of Brucella in both human and animal in Guizhou province was @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ biotype 3 and goat was the main animal source of infection of brucellosis in Guizhou province.	0
RESULTS: Methanobrevibacter smithii strains were resistant to ampicillin, @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$, gentamicin, rifampicin, ofloxacin, tetracycline and amphotericin B, with MICs >= 100 mg/L; these strains were also highly resistant to vancomycin (MIC >= 50 mg/L). They were moderately resistant to chloramphenicol (MIC <= 25 mg/L), and were susceptible to bacitracin (MIC <= 4 mg/L), metronidazole, ornidazole and squalamine (MIC <= 1 mg/L). The susceptibility of Methanosphaera stadtmanae was the same as M. smithii, except for chloramphenicol (MIC <= 4 mg/L), and @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$ yielded the same data as M.	4

RESULTS: The hypertensive group was associated with GM alterations; however, significant differences in beta-diversity and GM composition in hypertensive versus normotensive groups were only observed in women and not in men under various statistical models adjusting for the following covariates: age, sex, body mass index, sodium intake estimated by spot urine analysis, blood glucose, @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, menopause, and fatty liver status. Specifically, Ruminococcus gnavus, Clostridium bolteae, and Bacteroides ovatus were significantly more abundant in the hypertensive women, whereas @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ was more abundant in the normotensive women.	0
RESULTS: We isolated five bla NDM-1 harboring isolates of three different species namely Morganella morganii (n=2) Enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ (n=1), from 300 pus samples. These isolates were found extensive drug resistant (XDR). Strikingly, two isolates of M. morganii were displaying resistance against 23 antibiotics of sulphonamides, @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, polypeptide, monobactams, tetracyclines, quinolones, macrolides, cephalosporins, phosphonic acid and beta-lactams groups, suggesting Pan Drug Resistance (PDR).	4
RS cross-feeders utilize starch by-products or metabolites generated by upstream RS degraders, such as acetate, lactate, @sm$ formate @/sm$, and succinate. R. hominis A2-183 does not grow on starch in monoculture, but it does grow in co-culture with B. adolescentis L2-32, by utilizing substrate spillover and/or the acetate and lactate produced by B. adolescentis. Furthermore, R. hominis A2-183 is unable to degrade amylopectin or amylose, suggesting that it degrades smaller malto-oligosaccharide fractions. The R. hominis genome encodes fewer GH13s (8) than R. intestinalis (12 to 13) and @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ (10 to 12), and it does not encode GH13s possessing CBM26 or CBM41 domains.	2
Raw milk from 27 farms was sampled over 6 months for listerias, salmonellas, @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ and campylobacters. Total bacterial counts and somatic cell counts were measured. Lactococci, lactobacilli, dextran-producing leuconostocs, Brevibacterium linens, yeasts and moulds, Staphylococcus aureus and other Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonas, coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and spores of anaerobic @sm$ lactate @/sm$-fermenting bacteria were also counted. Pseudomonas (2000 cfu ml-1), lactococci (760 cfu ml-1) and Micrococcaceae (720 cfu ml-1) were the most numerous groups. Lactic acid bacteria were detected in all samples. Coliforms were present in most samples, but 84% of samples had counts < 100 cfu ml-1. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 62% of milks, the average count was 410 cfu ml-1. About 80% of supplies had < or = 10 E. coli cfu ml-1 and all samples had < or = 1 Cl. perfringens cfu ml-1. Two of the tested milks were positive for salmonellas (2.9%), four were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (5.8%), 25 for @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ (36%) and one for campylobacters (1.4%).	2
Recent research has revealed the relationship between small molecules such as @sm$ LPS @/sm$, BAs, and LTA produced by the gut microbiome and antitumour immunity in the liver, as previously reported. The production of the metabolite inosine as a result of intestinal @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ likely leads to the activation of antitumour T cells that express adenosine A2A receptor and enhance immunotherapy.	1
Recent studies have provided strong evidence that AgNPs induce cell death through @sm$ ROS @/sm$ generation in various bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter felis, E.	3
Recent studies on animal models that were genetically predisposed to CRC or were exposed to induction carcinogens such as azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) found that different prebiotics, including GOS derived from lactulose, inulin, and phenolic compounds such as @sm$ anthocyanins @/sm$ and ellagic acid, had inhibitory effects on the development of CRC. Notably, the use of FOS allows researchers to observe the beneficial effects of prebiotics on the development of CRC in a variety of human colon cell lines. Zheng et al. formulated spores-dex, i.e., prebiotics-encapsulated probiotic spores containing @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ (as a probiotic) and chemically modified dextran (as a prebiotic) and evaluated their anti-cancer effects in colon tumor models. As a result of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ fermenting dextran inside the lesions, SCFAs with anti-cancer potential were produced.	1
Recent vaccine development for typhoid fever has focused on Vi-conjugate vaccines, but efforts to develop vaccines against invasive NTS strains and against @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ have focused on O:LPS antigens. In contrast to S. Typhi, none of these pathogens are encapsulated with polysaccharide. For S. Paratyphi B there is evidence from field trials that Ty21a provides cross-protection and in our CHIM there is also evidence that anti-@sm$ O2 @/sm$:LPS IgG titers may correlate with protection against @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$, thus examination of O polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines currently in development in a CHIM is warranted.	0
Recently evidence was provided that the Maf glycosyltransferase from Geobacillus kaustophilus and Clostridium botulinum can modify flagellin with N-acetylneuraminic acid or 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid by O-linkage at threonine and @sm$ serine @/sm$ residues when expressed in E. coli. The Maf orthologs from @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ and Magnetospirillum magneticum magneticum are required for flagellin glycosylation in vivo.	2
Recently this pathotype attracted a great deal of attention when the EAEC isolate serotype @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ acquired the pathogenic traits of STEC pathotype and caused a devastating outbreak of diarrhea and HUS. Similar to typical EAECs the @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ strain carried pAA plasmid. This expressed AAF/I fimbriae and adhered to intestinal epithelial cells with a stacked-brick pattern. The genes for dispersin (aap), protein involved in intestinal colonization (pic) and Shigella enterotoxin (set1) were also detected in this strain. In addition through the acquisition of various mobile genetic elements the outbreak strain had obtained new traits including the phage-mediated Shiga toxin 2a, tellurite and @sm$ mercury @/sm$ resistance colicin, and resistance to all penicillins, ce-phalosporins, and cotrimoxazole, but lacked the LEE pathogenicity island.	4
Recently, @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiling has emerged as a way to complement bacterial identification where protein-based methods fail to provide accurate results. This study aimed to address the challenge of rapid discrimination between Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. using MALDI-TOF MS in the negative ion mode for @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiling coupled with machine learning. Both E. coli and @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species are closely related; they share high sequence homology, reported for 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between E. coli and Shigella spp. exceeding 99%, and a similar protein expression pattern but are epidemiologically distinct. A bacterial collection of 45 E. coli, 48 @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$, and 62 Shigella sonnei clinical isolates were submitted to @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiling in negative ion mode using the MALDI Biotyper Sirius  system after treatment with mild-acid hydrolysis (acetic acid 1% v/v for 15 min at 98 C). Spectra were then analyzed using our in-house machine learning algorithm and top-ranked features used for the discrimination of the bacterial species. Here, as a proof-of-concept, we showed that @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiling might have the potential to differentiate E. coli from @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species using the analysis of the top five ranked features obtained by MALDI-TOF MS in the negative ion mode of the MALDI Biotyper Sirius  system. Based on this new approach, MALDI-TOF MS analysis of @sm$ lipids @/sm$ might help pave the way toward these goals.	1
Recently, COSs conjugated with several polyphenols, including @sm$ catechin @/sm$ (@sm$ CAT @/sm$), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallic acid (GAL), caffeic acid (CAF), ferulic acid (FER), and proanthocyanidin, have been shown to possess antimicrobial, as well as antioxidative activities. COSs conjugated with epigallocatechin gallate (COS-EGCG) have antibacterial activity toward both spoilage bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MBC/MIC, 128/64 microg/mL) and foodborne pathogens involving @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ (MBC/MIC, 128/64 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MBC/MIC, 512/256 microg/mL), and L.	3
Recently, ccas (gene locus_tag: AXCY01000026.1, protein ID: KGM11272.1) and btas (gene locus_tag: BTHE_RS02440, protein ID: WP_044279707.1) genes from Cellulomonas carboniz T26 and @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 25525 @/gm$, respectively, were cloned in E. coli through sequence analysis, and each enzyme showed typical AS activity (Choi et al.,; Wang et al.,). Summary information and comparisons of the cloned AS genes are presented in Table 1. The enzyme characteristics of the microbial AS were studied with recombinant protein expression in E. coli. In most studies, the optimal temperature, pH, and enzyme units were measured using the simple 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (@sm$ DNS @/sm$) method to measure the ability of AS to utilize sucrose as a sole substrate. There is a difference in the enzyme measurement methodologies between research groups, and it is thus difficult to compare the exact AS activity levels. This review discusses the activity of AS when the activity were measured by the same experimental method. Most of the AS showed optimum enzyme activities in neutral conditions of pH 7.0-8.0 (Table 1). Interestingly, the BtAS present in @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ cultured under acidic conditions, showed optimal activity at weakly acidic conditions of pH 6.0 (Choi et al.,).	2
Recently, they evaluated the efficacy of sublethal concentrations of @sm$ thymol @/sm$ and carvacrol in blocking S. typhimurium infection of Caco-2 cells, focusing on the maintenance of the epithelial barrier changes in @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ virulence genes. The results showed that @sm$ thymol @/sm$ and carvacrol had a protective effect on the integrity of the intestinal monolayer, while improving transepithelial resistance and bacterial translocation. A real-time PCR study found that @sm$ thymol @/sm$ and carvacrol significantly down-regulated the major virulence genes (hilA, prgH, invA, sipA, sipC, sipD, sopB, and sopE2) in @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$. The results show that @sm$ thymol @/sm$ and carvacrol may help prevent and treat S.	3
Recently, we summarized the evidence for a significant involvement of @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ shed by dormant and resuscitating bacteria as underpinning the chronic inflammation characteristic of a variety of diseases, and suggested that @sm$ LPS @/sm$ may play a role in the pathogenesis of RA. The presence and role of @sm$ LPS @/sm$ may be supported by a recent review that provided evidence for the involvement of a microbiome in inflammatory arthritis and rheumatic diseases. Recently, Scher et al. also found strong correlates between the presence of @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ and new-onset untreated RA patients.	3
Recombinant forms of both enzymes were able to deacetylate the pseudosubstrate @sm$ chitotriose @/sm$ (GlcNAc3) with high substrate affinity but low substrate turnover. Here, we describe the further characterisation of the enzymes using gene deletions introduced by allelic replacement with the spectinomycin-resistance gene aad9. In addition, @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ gain-of-function mutants were generated.	2
Reductions of viable cells of Legionella pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$, and an intra-amoebal culture of Legionella pneumophila (water system only) were assessed in soil and in water after exposure to a citrus EO vapor at concentrations ranging from 3.75 mg/liter air to 15g/liter air. Antimicrobial efficacy via different delivery systems (passive and active sintering of the vapor) was determined in water, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the antimicrobial components (@sm$ linalool @/sm$, citral, and beta-pinene) was conducted. There was up to a 5-log cells ml(-1) reduction in Legionella spp. in soil after exposure to the citrus EO vapors (15 mg/liter air). The most susceptible strain in water was L. pneumophila, with a 4-log cells ml(-1) reduction after 24 h via sintering (15 g/liter air). Sintering the vapor through water increased the presence of the antimicrobial components, with a 61% increase of @sm$ linalool @/sm$.	3
Reference strains of Legionella pneumophila (serotypes 1-4, and 6), Legionella micdadei , and @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$ proved susceptible (agar dilution test, buffered charcoal yeast extract agar) to @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, rifampin, augmentin (amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid), cefotaxime, cefoxitin, enoxacin , fusidic acid, and norfloxacin; cefamandole was less active.	3
Reference strains of Legionella pneumophila (serotypes 1-4, and 6), Legionella micdadei , and @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$ proved susceptible (agar dilution test, buffered charcoal yeast extract agar) to erythromycin, @sm$ rifampin @/sm$, augmentin (amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid), cefotaxime, cefoxitin, enoxacin , fusidic acid, and norfloxacin; cefamandole was less active.	3
Reference strains of Treponema denticola, Treponema pectinovorum, @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$, Treponema socranskii subspecies buccale and Treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii were cultured anaerobically in duplicate on different days in Pectin medium for 4 days at 37 degrees C under @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ atmosphere. Treponemal cells were harvested by centrifugation. Thereafter, their supernatants were filtered through 0.22-micron Millipore filters and subjected to CZE. The resulting electropherograms clearly distinguished T. denticola, T. pectinovorum and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$.	2
Regarding Aeromonads, the occurrence of @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ species complex was in accordance with data of stored and refrigerated foods such as raw fish (Alhazmi) and vacuum-packed milkfish (Simon et al.). However, considering the low discriminatory power of 16S rRNA for the genera Acinetobacter (Alvarez-Buylla et al.) and @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ (Minana-Galbis), additional identification methods are recommended in the future to reach a reliable differentiation at the species level. Regarding Psychrobacters, the available information on the identified species supports their minor role in spoilage defects. P. cibarius does not produce a significant amount of volatile organic compounds at 4  C, just a slight amount of trimethylamine (@sm$ TMA @/sm$) (Broekaert et al.).	1
Regarding quinolones, all strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and only one strain of @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. was resistant to levofloxacin. The highest index of resistance found was for ampicillin with 38.4% of resistant samples. All evaluated strains were also sensitive to clindamycin, clarithromycin, oxacillin, linezolid and @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$.	3
Regarding the biochemical identification, @gm$ ORT @/gm$ isolates are positive oxidase and negative catalase. Commercial kits (API-20 NE and API-ZYM) are used for the biochemical characterization of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ isolates. The bacterium is positive for arginine dihydrolase, beta- galactosidase, gelatin liquefaction, and Voges-Praskauer tests, while negative for L-lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and H2S production tests. Regarding sugar fermentation tests, @gm$ ORT @/gm$ reveals positive sucrose, arabinose, lactose, fructose, galactose, and maltose, but negative glucose, @sm$ mannitol @/sm$, inositol, and sorbitol.	2
Regarding the direct relation of bacteria with pathogenic mechanisms of the disease, again Akkermansia muciniphila is outlined due to its capacity to increase GABA/@sm$ glutamate @/sm$ ratios in the hippocampus. In addition, evidence shows that some species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium segregate GABA, being the GABA system one of the main mechanisms of brain chemistry modulation by intestinal bacteria. In particular, the Lactobacillus species: L. rhamnosus and L. brevis, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$, increase the GABA neurotransmitter.	1
Remarkably, 8 out of 15 strains (8/15, 53.33%) were mainly from Lachnospiraceae, including Blautia wexlerae, Agathobacter rectalis, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, Lachnospira eligens, Blautia sp900066165, Faecalicatena torques, Roseburia intestinalis, KLE1615 sp900066985, a typical group of bacteria that produce SCFA (i.e., @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate).	1
Reports show that the intestinal bacteria can elaborate a plethora of neurotransmitters including dopamine, gamma-amino butyrate, norepinephrine, @sm$ acetylcholine @/sm$, and serotonin that can affect mood as well as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (e.g., butyrate) and hormones such as cortisol and chemicals that modulate the immune system (e.g., quinolinic acid). For example, the Flemish Gut Flora Project observed a depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria (i.e., @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ and Dialister) in individuals diagnosed with depression. Whilst gut bacteria that were butyrate producers such as Faecalibacterium and @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality of life indicators.	1
Resistance of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ to broad-spectrum cephalosporins or carbapenems has been reported, though it is uncommon in @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ isolates. In this study, all three isolates exhibited resistance to @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, piperacillin/tazobactam sodium, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefuroxime sodium, and cefoxitin. Three patients had severe spinal infections with fever; meropenem was administered since @sm$ imipenem @/sm$ is contraindicated for increased risk of neurological infection. Therefore, the emergence of this multidrug-resistant @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ may have an impact on therapeutic decisions.	4
Resistance to @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$ in @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ occurs through the production of efflux pumps, @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ modifying enzymes that work via adenylation, acetylation or phosphorylation of target drugs, or by the production of 16SrRNA methylase, an enzyme that blocks the binding of @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$ antibiotics to the 30S ribosomal subunit. In contrast to the narrow-spectrum of activity of the modifying enzymes, 16SrRNA methylase confers extremely high levels of resistance to nearly all @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, including tobramycin, gentamicin and amikacin, which are commonly used in clinical practice.	4
Resistance to @sm$ chromium @/sm$ was also identified for the Pseudomonas strains, with the exception of. the @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ and P. mosselii strains, and the P. chlororaphis LBs-160603 strain encoded genes associated with resistance to zinc. Genes associated with resistances to mercury were only annotated for the genome of Pseudomonas sp. MB-090624. To test resistance to mercury, this strain as well as one of the @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ and one of the P.	4
Resistance to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ and erythromycin was observed in 15 and 1.7% of @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ isolates, respectively, in the same French study (Tinevez et al.,). Cefotaxime was described to have a lower in vitro bactericidal activity compared with ampicillin, gentamicin, and imipenem, and its susceptibility was described as intermediate in 12-62% of studied strains in Canada and France, respectively (Spelhaug et al.,; Tremblay et al.,; Gazaigne et al.,). The use of third-generation cephalosporins was also described to be a risk factor for death in Campylobacter spp. bacteremia with species other than @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ (Pacanowski et al.,). In our study, all strains remained susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, gentamicin, and imipenem. Different antibiotic regiments were used, and in three patients, no antibiotics were taken including one with @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ bacteremia (Table 1). This fact confirmed the possibility of transient @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ bacteremia, resolved without antimicrobial therapy.	4
Resistance to amikacin, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, tobramycin, and gentamicin was observed in all 45 armA-harboring @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolates. Additionally, 40 of the strains (including 13 from outpatients and 27 from food/environmental samples) were found to be fluoroquinolone-resistant, and 35 of these fluoroquinolone-resistant strains (including 10 from outpatients and 25 from food/environmental samples) were identified as ESBL producers. In contrast, all 45 armA-harboring @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ strains were susceptible to both imipenem and tigecycline. The ampicillin-resistant rates of the armA-harboring @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ strains isolated from poultry or outpatients were much higher than that of armA-harboring @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ strains isolated from swine (36/37 vs.	4
Resistant maltodextrin and inulin produced the greatest increase in total SCFA levels followed by resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ and rice bran (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S1). Each fiber type had a distinct metabolic signature: resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ was highly butyrogenic, resistant maltodextrin was highly propiogenic, and inulin and rice bran promoted the production of all three SCFA (Fig. 2c-f and Supplementary Table S1). Although rice bran produced less SCFA than the other fibers, it increased the abundance of unique bacteria that were not enriched by other fibers (e.g., @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Dorea, Fusobacterium). Thus, to support the growth of a diverse group of beneficial bacterial groups and promote the production of all three SCFA, the following fiber mixture composition was used: 30% resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ (raw potato @sm$ starch @/sm$), 30% resistant maltodextrin (NutrioseTM), 30% stabilized rice bran, and 10% agave branched inulin.	2
Results: In 1 index sample, routine culture found Porphyromonas endodontalis and Streptococcus intermedius, and specific culture found @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$ susceptible to @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ and fusidic acid.	3
Results: In the analysis of the microbial composition, the current smokers were characterized with depleted @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$, Akkermansia muciniphila, and enriched Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus parainfluenzae compared with the former and never smokers. In the untargeted serum metabolomic study, we observed and annotated 304 discriminant metabolites, uniquely including @sm$ ceramides @/sm$, acyl carnitines, and glycerophospholipids.	0
Resveratrol inhibited TMAO-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice (Chen et al., 2016) and it also increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and Akkermansia and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in mice. Chen et al. suggest that resveratrol attenuates TMAO-induced atherosclerosis by decreasing TMAO levels via gut microbiota remodelling (Chen et al., 2016). Resveratrol treatment also increases the fasting-induced adipose factor (Fiaf), a key gene for the deposition of @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$, which may be associated with the prebiotic effect of resveratrol on gut microbiota (Qiao et al., 2014).	3
Rotenone is an inhibitor to NADH dehydrogenase whilst @sm$ sodium azide @/sm$ and cyanide are inhibitors to the terminal cytochrome d oxidase. Antimycin A is an inhibitor to cytochrome b.. The use of respiratory to probe the location or identity of other metal-reducing enzymes in various studies has shown mixed results. Respiratory inhibitors tested in this work such as azide, rotenone, and cyanide had failed to inhibit chromate reduction in E. coli and in @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ , while cyanide and azide inhibit the reduction of chromate in Bacillus subtilis and oxidation of arsenite in Alcaligense sp..	4
Rough Brucella cells devoid of the O-antigen retain more @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$ compared to their parental strains; @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, a naturally rough species, retains high amounts of the dye. As expected, we did not observe an increased staining of the DeltamapB colonies on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates in the presence of @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$ compared to the wild type and complemented strains. On the contrary, while wild type colonies showed an evident violet coloration in the presence of @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$, mutant colonies hardly retained the dye. The complementing pBBRmapB plasmid restored the phenotype (Fig. 2D). Hence, even though this observation further supports that the DeltamapB mutant is not a rough strain, the mutant colony phenotype on @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$ is consistent with the idea that the DeltamapB mutant displays an altered cell envelope.	3
Roy and Nayak noted that the exposure of @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$ at the rate of 1 and 3 ppm to the HPB accelerated the biofilm formation by these bacteria. @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ was an exception in this study where its ability to form a biofilm was found to be significantly decreased following the exposure to 5 ppm @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$.	3
Ruminococcus bromii generates @sm$ formate @/sm$, acetate, and ethanol when provided resistant starch. When co-cultured with @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, @sm$ formate @/sm$ was consumed and additional acetate was produced. A consequence of sugar fermentation is the generation of H2. Fermentation efficiency is reduced as H2 accumulates, inhibiting bacterial NADH-dependent dehydrogenases. Mutualism between B. thetaiotaomicron and D. piger has been reported. In co-colonized mice, B. thetaiotaomicron increases the fitness of D. piger by providing sulfate, compensating for the lack of sulfatase functions encoded by the D. piger genome. D. piger consumes H2 thus allowing fermentation efficiency of B. thetaiotaomicron to be maintained. Moreover, the activities of some species alter the metabolic preferences of others. Methanobrevibacter smithii directs B. thetaiotaomicron to preferentially ferment dietary fructans that generate acetate and @sm$ formate @/sm$ that are subsequently consumed by M.	2
"S-equol is produced as a result of the breakdown of dietary isoflavones such as daidzein and @sm$ genistein @/sm$ by gut bacteria. S-equol production requires a complete set of enzymes daidzein reductase dihydrodaidzein reductase and tetrahydrodaidzein reductase to metabolize daidzein to S-equol. @sm$ Genistein @/sm$ was found to be catalyzed at an even higher rate by daidzein reductase compared to daidzein. Our previous study showed that both isoflavone-metabolizing bacteria and their product is required for EAE suppression. Even though rodents can efficiently produce S-equol from phytoestrogen metabolism we did not find well-known bacterial ""equol producers"" such as Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$ species Slackia isoflavoniconvertens and Lactococcus garvieae that were differentially enriched at baseline between the ISO and PF fed mice or at endpoint after the diet change."	1
S-layer proteins are found in most bacteria, such as @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$, L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. brevis (Johnson et al.). Most S-layer proteins can be broken down via their @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ bonds using high concentrations of solvents to achieve separation (Baumeister et al.).	0
SCFAs are bacterial metabolic products known to play a critical role in host-intestinal immunity and function and previous reports have highlighted @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ as a significant SCFA-producer. To determine the metabolic function of our clinical isolates, germ-free mice were mono-colonized with patient-derived @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, A. finegoldii or B. producta for 10 days. As expected, a significantly higher abundance of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate and propionate was detected in cecal contents of @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ mono-colonized mice compared to germ-free controls (Figure 5A). While B. producta mono-colonized mice had similar SCFA levels to that observed in germ-free mice, mono-colonization with A. finegoldii led to significantly higher production of @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and lower butyrate and propionate compared to @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ (Figure 5A).	1
SCFAs are defined as groups of fatty acids comprising less than six carbons, mainly @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate. These three fatty acids accounted for more than 95% of the total SCFAs, with a ratio of 60:20:20. However, this proportion was not constant, as it relies on many factors, such as dietary components, microbiota composition, and the site of fermentation. @sm$ Acetate @/sm$ is most abundant in the colon, accounting for more than half of the total SCFAs detected in feces and can be formed through two major pathways: the acetyl-CoA and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways. Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp Ruminococcus spp., @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, and Clostridium spp. are involved in these two pathways. Aacetogenic bacteria can also synthesize @sm$ acetate @/sm$ from carbon dioxide and formate through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.	1
SCFAs are fatty acids with fewer than six carbons produced by bacteria, such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus during polysaccharide fermentation in the colon. The main SCFAs produced by GIM are @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate, which are absorbed through the intestine before being circulated to the liver and other organs, namely, the brain.	1
SCFAs are involved in maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity, controlling glucose, @sm$ lipid @/sm$, and energy metabolism, and regulating the immune system and inflammatory responses based on multiple pathways, such as the G protein-coupled receptor family, and epigenetic modification by acting as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Most acetates and propionates are mainly derived from the gut microbiota of phylum Bacteroidetes, such as species Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Eubacterium hallii, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$, whereas phylum Firmicutes, the main producers of butyrate, includes species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, and Ruminococcus gnavus.	1
SCFAs can be synthesized in the oral cavity using two primary approaches: @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ hydrolysis or amino acid metabolism. @sm$ Carbohydrates @/sm$ undergo fermentation, leading to the formation of monosaccharides, followed by the conversion to pyruvate through either the pentose phosphate pathway (C5) or glycolysis (C6). Bacterial species with the capability to convert sugars into SCFAs include Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$.	1
SCFAs, such as @sm$ acetate @/sm$, proprionate, and butyrate, exert multiple beneficial physiological effects in the host: acting as anti-inflammatory agents, supporting the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells, serving as modulators of chemotaxis and adhesion of immune cells, promoting GI motility through direct inhibition of G-coupled-receptors, inhibiting histone deacetylases, and serving as energy substrates for intestinal epithelial cells. SCFAs produced by @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and cross-fed microbial communities also act as general growth suppressants for a variety of gut pathogens. These same SCFAs may slow bacterial translocation from the intestine, limiting the scope of infection through enhanced epithelial barrier function. Other metabolites of B. bifidum and @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ produced from fermented 3'-SL suppress expression of virulence factors found in E. coli and Salmonella. The presence of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ is associated with broad changes in gene expression within the neonatal intestine.	1
SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in Flavonifractor plautii, @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$, Bilophila wadsworthia, and Sellimonas intestinalis, while depleted in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus lactaris, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and Veillonella rogosae. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for @sm$ dopamine @/sm$, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (rho = 0.34, q <= .1).	1
SD_Bt-00002, predicted to belong to the genus @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ of the family Ruminococcaceae, was identified from the rumen of cow C. Originally isolated from the anaerobic sludge of molasses wastewater, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ is thus far the only cultured representative of its genus. It is capable of fermenting various mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, including d-glucose and cellobiose, into ethanol, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Based on these metabolic activities, co-enrichment of an uncharacterized species of @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ suggests that it may benefit from the cellulose metabolizing activity of other rumen bacteria, such as perhaps SD_Bt-00003 and/or SD_Bt-00004, that were also enriched from the same animal. These results would be consistent with reports from other research groups. Indeed, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ was found to be among the main species enriched in the second generation of a repeated-batch culture of ruminal fluid supplemented with napiergrass, and an @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$-related OTU was recently identified from rumen fluid supplemented with wheat straw. While SD_Bt-00002 and other uncharacterized rumen species of @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ may be capable of metabolizing cellulose, future investigations will be required to determine their metabolic activities in the gastro-intestinal tract of ruminants.	1
STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Acid producing bacteria including @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ and lactobacilli cause tooth demineralization and lead to tooth decay. Also, oral colonization of the species of Candida has been reported in many studies that are resistant to antifungal agents. OBJECTIVES: In this study, antibacterial and antifungal effects of nano-CuO were studied against some oral bacteria and yeast fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) for oral bacterial and fungal test strains were determined in 96-well microtiter plate technique. The agar diffusion test (ADT) was employed to assess the antifungal properties of @sm$ nystatin @/sm$. RESULTS: The MIC50 value of CuO NPs was determined at the range of 1-10 microg/ml for @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$, < 1 microg/ml for L. acidophilus, and 10 microg/ml for L. casei. Higher concentrations of CuO NPs (100-1000 microg/ml) were effective on the bacterial cell growth, resulting in 100% reduction in the optical density in TSB medium. The cells of Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. glabrata were treated with CuO NPs and the results showed a decrease in fungal growth at a concentration of 1-1000 microg/ml in TSB medium. The MIC50 value of CuO NPs was determined 1000 microg/ml for three species of Candida. The diameter of growth inhibition zones of 1100 microg/ml @sm$ nystatin @/sm$ was obtained 15-21 mm for clinical isolates of three species of Candida.	3
Samples from CD patients who relapsed (REL-TP1, n = 13) were enriched in three GMMs, including propionate production II (FDR = 0.009), @sm$ lactate @/sm$ consumption II (FDR = 0.009) and glutamate degradation I (FDR = 0.02), compared to those from CD patients in remission (REM-TP1, n = 22), with @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ as the main contributor for the two first pathways and Acidaminococcus intestini for the last one (Fig.	2
Samples from CD patients who relapsed (REL-TP1, n = 13) were enriched in three GMMs, including propionate production II (FDR = 0.009), lactate consumption II (FDR = 0.009) and @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ degradation I (FDR = 0.02), compared to those from CD patients in remission (REM-TP1, n = 22), with @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ as the main contributor for the two first pathways and Acidaminococcus intestini for the last one (Fig.	2
Samples of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ cells were grown on TSAB supplemented with kanamycin and incubated for 2 days. Cells were resuspended in milliQ @sm$ H2O @/sm$ and 1 mul of cells were spotted on an agarose pad on a cover slide and imaged on a Leica DMI 6000 microscope in phase contrast with an HC PL APO 63x/1.4 numeric aperture (NA) oil Ph3 CS2 objective.	0
Samples of raw milk, unpasteurized cheeses, sheep feces, and honey were serially diluted in maximum recovery diluent (Oxoid) and plated on several medium types for the isolation of bacteriocin-producing bacteria: @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ selective agar (tryptone, 10.0 g   liter-1; sucrose, 10.0 g   liter-1; yeast extract, 5.0 g   liter-1; @sm$ K2HPO4 @/sm$, 2.0 g   liter-1; bromocresol purple, 0.03 g   liter-1; agar, 15.0 g   liter-1) incubated aerobically at 42 C; M17 (Merck) supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) lactose incubated at 30 C aerobically; de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS; Difco) agar supplemented with 30 mug   ml-1 l-vancomycin hydrochloride incubated at 37 C; MRS adjusted to pH 5.4 incubated at 42 C anaerobically; Lactobacillus selective agar (LBS) incubated at 30 C anaerobically; and TOS (transgalactosylated oligosaccharide) agar supplemented with 50 mug   ml-1 lithium mupirocin incubated at 37 C anaerobically.	0
Scanning electron microscopy also showed that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ other than B. adolescentis adopted the bifid form, but only very rarely, and only under stress conditions (Figures 2B-H). Therefore, it is clear that the bifid form is an intrinsic to B. adolescentis, but not to the other @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species, although a few Bifidobacterial species adopt the bifid form under stress conditions. reported that changes to the bifid form occurred in different generations of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, but our study clearly shows that the first, second and third generations of B. adolescentis maintained the bifid morphology (Figure 6). Dramatic changes in B. adolescentis were only observed when it was exposed to different pH (pH 5.5-7.5), when it adopted a coccoid shape (Figure 3). Therefore, the number of coccus-shaped bacteria was much higher depicted in the initiation of coccus formation, but reverted back to the bifid form. CaCl2 plays a significant role in the conversion of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ from the bifid shape to the rod form, suggesting the involvement of calmodulin or a similar molecule. This phenomenon was observed when B. adolescentis were subjected to different concentrations of CaCl2 (0.001-0.01 M). As the @sm$ calcium @/sm$ concentration increased, the cells became rod-shaped, short, and bulging, with terminal buttons, and they also aggregated (Figure 5).	3
Schwarzengrund, 2 were @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$, and 2 were S. Stanleyville. Furthermore, all 73 Salmonella isolates were evaluated for susceptibilities to eleven antibiotics. The rates of resistance were 41.1% for nalidixic acid and 37.0% for ciprofloxacin, while, resistance to other test agents varied substantially (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid: 43.8%, ampicillin: 42.5%, cefazolin: 47.9%, @sm$ doxycycline @/sm$: 95.9%, gentamicin: 6.8%, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: 100%, chloramphenicol: 43.8%, meropenem: 2.0%, and ceftriaxone: 12.3%).	4
Search parameters were: Precursor tolerance 4 ppm and product ion tolerances +-0.4 Da; Oxidation (M) and Carbamidomethyl (@sm$ C @/sm$) specified as variable modifications, enzyme specificity was trypsin, 1 missed cleavage was possible and the @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ BAA-1457 or UNSWCD complete proteome sequences searched.	0
Seaweeds are rich in @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ such as alginates, fucoidans, and sulfated galactans. Although there are no studies in humans of the effect of seaweeds and @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ in them on gut microbiota, a study in rats showed that intake of Laminaria japonica increased the abundance of lactic acid-producing bacteria such as @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ and Streptococcus. @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ reportedly assimilates a wide range of carbohydrates and uses enzymes such as beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase in their degradation of carbohydrates. No studies have reported on the assimilation of @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ by @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, but we found a positive association between intake of seaweeds and the number of @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ (Table 4). Therefore, @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ in seaweeds are likely to affect the number of @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$.	2
Second, we found the phylum Verrucomicrobia and the corresponding genus @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ to be virtually absent in Ag-treated rats, whereas @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ accounted for 1-4% of the total gut microbiomes in untreated controls and in @sm$ SiO2 @/sm$-treated animals in close accordance to established levels for @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ municiphila. Although the observed alterations could not be proven to be statistically significant due to individual variations in the vehicle control group, it should remain under consideration for future studies that @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ may be strongly affected by an oral uptake of Ag nanomaterials. Comparable effects have been reported for different metals (Al, Cu, Pb, Cd), where subchronic oral exposures greatly reduced abundance of @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ in mice (for review see). @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ contributes to the host immune system and stimulates the proliferation of anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells in mice. In numerous studies, abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ was found to be reduced in various intestinal diseases, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) or appendicitis as well as in extra-intestinal diseases like obesity, autism or atopy.	3
Sequence analysis indicated similarity of BDG-Glc5 to beta-mannanase and glycosyl hydrolase family 26 proteins from Coprococcus species that contained the following domains:GH26 (members of which have beta-mannanase, exo-beta-1,4-mannobiohydrolase, beta-1,3-xylanase, endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase, and mannobiose-producing exo-beta-mannanase activities as per CAZy), CBM11 (members of which bind to beta-1,4-glucan and beta-1,3/4 glucans as per CAZy), CBM27 (members of which bind to @sm$ mannans @/sm$ as per CAZy), and complex I intermediate-associated protein 30 (a domain similar to CBM11 in Pfam-A HH search) (Supplementary Data 1, Table S5). Further, BDG-Glc5 itself contained CBM27 and (putative mannan binding) CBM23 domains in searches against the dbCAN2 database (Supplementary Data 1, Table S6). BDG-BDG6 showed similarity to @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ polygalacturonases and an IPT/TIG domain containing protein but showed no hits in searches against the dbCAN2 and Pfam databases (Supplementary Data 1, Tables S5, S6, S7, and S8).	1
Sera positive for the mRBPT were further tested with CFT for confirmation using the standard Brucella @gm$ abortus @/gm$ antigen (New Haw, Addleston, Surrey KT15 3NB, UK). The CFT test proper and reagent preparation procedures followed the procedures outlined by the OIE. A sheep red blood cell (1%) suspension was prepared before the beginning of the test, and test sera with >= 50% sedimentation at a dilution of 1:5 and above were considered to be positive. The reading was: complete fixation (no hemolysis) with a @sm$ water @/sm$-clear supernatant was recorded as + + + +, nearly complete fixation (75% clearing) as + + +, partial hemolysis (50%) as + + and some fixation (25% clearing) as +.	0
Serum biochemistry confirmed the metabolic switch from carbohydrates to @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ and ketones. Emotional and physical well-being were enhanced. Faecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that fasting caused a decrease in the abundance of bacteria known to degrade dietary polysaccharides such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. There was a concomitant increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$), known to use host-derived energy substrates.	2
Serum metabolites differentially expressed with glyphosate treatment were associated with nicotinamide, branched-chain amino acid, methionine, cysteine, and @sm$ taurine @/sm$ metabolism, indicative of a response to oxidative stress. MON 52276 had similar, but more pronounced, effects than glyphosate on the serum metabolome. Shotgun metagenomics of the cecum showed that treatment with glyphosate and MON 52276 resulted in higher levels of Eggerthella spp., Shinella zoogleoides, @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, and Akkermansia muciniphila.	0
Several abundant saturated fatty acids were also identified, including hexadecanoic acid (C16:0, 30%), @sm$ octadecanoic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ C18:0 @/sm$, 7%), tetradecanoic acid (C14:0, 13%), and dodecanoic acid (C12:0, 6%) (Table S1). By comparison, @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, C. intestinalis, and C. stercoris possessed @sm$ octadecanoic acid @/sm$ as major fatty acid (Nagai et al., 2010).	1
Several bacterial genera that are common in the distal intestine (e.g., @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus) are known to synthesize vitamins. @sm$ Thiamine @/sm$, folate, biotin, riboflavin, and panthothenic acid are water-soluble vitamins that are plentiful in the diet, but that are also synthesized by gut bacteria.	1
Several bacterial species, e.g., Escherichia, Salmonella, @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$, possess specific enzymes to produce @sm$ H2S. @/sm$ A phosphate-sulfite reductase maintains the redox balance by reducing sulfite to @sm$ H2S @/sm$ and NADP+ or oxidizing @sm$ H2S @/sm$ to sulfite and recovering NADPH. Bacteria expressing cysteine desulfhydrase convert cysteine to @sm$ H2S @/sm$, pyruvate and ammonia. Bilophila wadsworthia utilizes taurine by taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase to sulfoacetaldhyde and alanine, which is further metabolized by sulfoacetaldhyde sulfolyase to sulfite and acetate. Subsequent sulfite reduction by sulfite reductase produces @sm$ H2S @/sm$ and CO2. Tissue enzymes also metabolize methionine to homocysteine, which is coupled with serine to form cystathionine by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) subsequently converts cystathionine to cysteine, which CBS or CSE may further transform to @sm$ H2S. @/sm$ Half of the luminal @sm$ H2S @/sm$ is produced by gut microbiota and half by colonic tissues. Interestingly, the inhibition of the colonic tissue enzymes promotes the production of @sm$ H2S @/sm$ by gut microbiota.	1
Several evidences (both in vivo and in vitro) suggest the involvement of fluoroquinolones in the inhibition of @sm$ LPS @/sm$-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several interleukins, such as IL-1 and IL-6 production. One of the critical components in acne is host-mediated inflammation. @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ is known to induce inflammatory cytokine expression, including TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12, in macrophages via activation of TLR-2. The role of IL-6 in @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced cell lines, such as macrophages, keratinocytes and sebocytes, has been shown in multiple reports. Alestas et al. found enhanced IL-6 expression in acne-involved skin. The IL-1 family of cytokines has been found to be associated with tissue damage in acne patients. VB-1953 was found to reduce dead @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced inflammation in both in vitro and in vivo models. This action is independent of its bactericidal action. In vitro, VB-1953 significantly reduced IL-6 levels in the human monocyte cell line THP-1. Furthermore, VB-1953 showed a dose-dependent reduction in messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 in THP-1 cells (unpublished data). VB-1953 formulation was also found to exert anti-inflammatory effects in a dead @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced rat paw edema model (unpublished data).	3
Several reports have demonstrated the importance of @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ as focal point in metabolism and in virulence control of pathogens, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, S. Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Chlostridium difficile require extracellular @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ for biofilm formation. Mammalian apoptotic cells also release @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$, which has been shown to promote the growth of S. Typhimurium. This suggests an important role for @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ in host inflammation and infection.	2
Several simple or aryl hydrazone @sm$ pyrazole @/sm$-containing derivatives of 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-yl-2H-pyran-2-one were obtained by Penta et al. (2013) via one-pot, multicomponent reaction. The results of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus and B. subtilis) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$) showed that some aryl hydrazone derivatives inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains.	3
Several species (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides eggerthii, Escherichia albertii, Parabacteroides merdae, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Serratia entomophila, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$, Ruminococcus callidus, Anaerobranca zavarzinii, and Bacteroides vulgatus) were positively correlated (r > 0.7; FDR < 0.05) with total and animal proteins, lipids, @sm$ sodium @/sm$, calcium, and phosphorus intakes.	2
Several species (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides eggerthii, Escherichia albertii, Parabacteroides merdae, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Serratia entomophila, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$, Ruminococcus callidus, Anaerobranca zavarzinii, and Bacteroides vulgatus) were positively correlated (r > 0.7; FDR < 0.05) with total and animal proteins, lipids, sodium, @sm$ calcium @/sm$, and phosphorus intakes.	2
Several species (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides eggerthii, Escherichia albertii, Parabacteroides merdae, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Serratia entomophila, Eubacterium cylindroides, Ruminococcus callidus, Anaerobranca zavarzinii, and Bacteroides vulgatus) were positively correlated (r > 0.7; FDR < 0.05) with total and animal proteins, lipids, @sm$ sodium @/sm$, calcium, and phosphorus intakes. The same species showed negative correlations with the intake of dietary fibers, vegetal proteins, potassium, and ketoanalogs. Opposite correlation trends were found for other dominant species (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia faecis, Blautia wexlerae, Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Blautia obeum, @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$, Sarcina maxima, Lachnospira pectinoachiza, Coprococcus eutactus, Blautia coccoides, Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans, and Clostridium cadaveris).	2
Several species of commensal Gram-positive bacteria in the colon possess the ability to synthesize butyrate, primarily from dietary @sm$ starch @/sm$ and fiber, with the two most abundant groups appearing to be Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ species, belonging to clostridial clusters IV and XIVa, respectively.	1
Several studies found a positive correlation between O2 tolerance of Bifidobacterium strains and the ability to detoxify @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$. Genomics and proteomics have revealed that bifidobacteria lack a gene for NADH peroxidase and that an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC) and a thioredoxin reductase-like protein (TrxR), encoded next to AhpC, instead may be responsible for @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$ decomposition. Our results showed that in 78% of the analyzed species, all strains harbored both an AhpC and TrxR homolog (Fig. 1). No strain possessed only one of the genes, which reaffirms the assumption of their coactivity (Fig. S1). The presence of the AhpC-TrxR system in O2-sensitive strains, such as B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697, suggests that in these strains the @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$ detoxification activity provided by the system is insufficient to cope with @sm$ H2O2 @/sm$ formation under aerobic conditions. Strains of the species B. angulatum, including B. angulatum DSM 20098, reported to be highly O2-sensitive (Table S3), @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$, B.	3
Several studies have demonstrated that @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Alloprevotella produce SCFAs, which are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Performing KEGG pathways analysis, using PICRUSt, we found that multiple pathways involved in the metabolism of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ were upregulated in RhoB+/-/RhoB-/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5C). Measurement of SCFA concentrations in fecal samples revealed a significant increase of six prominent SCFAs (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butanoic acid, isovaleric acid, isobutyric acid, and valeric acid) in RhoB+/- mice compared with WT mice, and a trend, without significant difference, was also observed for RhoB-/- mice (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, the level of SCFA concentrations were positively correlated to the relative abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Alloprevotella in fecal samples of RhoB-/-, RhoB+/-, and WT mice (Fig.	1
Several studies have linked improvements in gut health with the increase in gastrointestinal AO capacity following intake of AOs such as polyphenols and @sm$ tocopherols @/sm$. Polyphenols such as lignans and flavonoids:both products of fermentation of plant components by bifidobacteria:possess an AO effect. In the study of Braune and Blaut, the ability of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains (n = 25) to produce lignan and flavonoids aglycones from flaxseed and soybean extracts were examined. Most of the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains increased the concentrations of secoisolariciresinol, daidzein, genistein, naringenin, eriodyctiol, luteolin, and apigenin. Moreover, B. pseudocatenulatum and B. breve strains showed high production of herbacetin, increased the kaempferol concentration, and produced quercetin and quercetagetin. @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains converted the glycosides of a wide range of flavonoids into their aglycones, increasing the AO activity and improving their bioavailability.	1
Severe GvHD was associated with lower levels of the families Lachnospiraceae, including @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ spp., and Ruminococcaceae. SCFAs are significantly lower in GvHD patients and have been shown to be protective against chronic GvHD. Others have shown that an increased abundance of genera @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ was also associated with reduced GvHD lethality and improved survival. Similarly, genera Enterococcus was also associated with a higher incidence of GvHD, with lactose facilitating its growth. Gut metabolite @sm$ trimethylamine N-oxide @/sm$ has also been associated with an increased risk of GvHD, due to increased immune activation.	1
Sheared, @sm$ TCA @/sm$ precipitated samples and whole cell lysates were boiled for 10 minutes in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE (7.5% running gel, 4.5% stacking gel), and transferred to PVDF membrane using standard Western blotting protocols. Membranes were blocked with 5% (wt/vol) non-fat dry milk in PBS containing 1% Tween (PBST) for 1 hour at 25 C and probed with rabbit alpha-FliC (Becton Dickson, Difco @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ H Antiserum i) at a dilution of 1:10,000 or alpha-FljB (Becton Dickson, Difco @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ H Antiserum Single Factor 2) at a dilution of 1:1,000 overnight at 4 C in blocking solution.	0
Shigella can be classified into four serogroups or species based on O @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ antigen type: S. dysenteriae (subgroup A), S. flexneri (subgroup B), @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ (subgroup C), and S.	1
Shigella is a gram-negative, @sm$ lactose @/sm$-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen, closely related to Escherichia coli (E. coli). It was recognized as the etiologic agent of bacillary dysentery or shigellosis in the 1890s, and in the 1950s, Shigella was adopted as a genus and subgrouped into four species (spp.): Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexnerii, @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$, and Shigella sonnei.	2
Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are volatile fatty acids consisting of a straight-chain, aliphatic tail of fewer than six @sm$ carbon @/sm$ atoms and are produced by fermentation of oligosaccharide concomitant with increases in beneficial bacteria including @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$.	1
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major end-products of anaerobic fermentation by microbiota in the large intestine, including acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, @sm$ valeric acid @/sm$ and hexanoic acid. Acetic acid is produced by most enteric bacteria, such as acetogenic bacteria through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. But propionic acid is mainly produced by Bacteroides and Propionibacterium through succinate pathway. Butyrate-producing bacteria mainly include Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, and Roseburia genera, whereas Roseburia Inulinivorans and @gm$ Coprococcus Catus @/gm$ are able to produce propionic acid and butyric acid.	1
Shortening the amine branch to the methylamine (compounds 10:11), also resulted in promising activity, though with greater differences in antimicrobial activity between the diastereomers, particularly against @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ and E. coli IHMA 558090. Encouragingly, the more active diastereomer (11) also exhibited a fourfold reduction in HK-2 cytotoxicity compared to PMB. The @sm$ alpha-amino acids @/sm$ 12 and 13, prepared from d- and l-cyclohexylglycine, respectively, were less potent than compounds with a methylamine or ethylamine branch and also showed a strong diastereomer preference in favour of compound 12. It should be noted that the compound with the N-terminal natural @sm$ l-amino acid @/sm$, 13 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against only P.	3
Shredded carrots were inoculated with approximately 6-7 log CFU/g of @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$ (932, and 933) and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116, and 19111) and then dip treated with alkaline electrolyzed water (AlEW), acidic electrolyzed water (AcEW), 100 ppm @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$ (@sm$ NaOCl @/sm$), deionized water (DaIW), or 1% citric acid (CA) alone or with combinations of AlEW and 1% CA (AlEW + CA). The populations of spoilage bacteria on the carrots were investigated after various exposure times (1, 3, and 5 min) and treatment at different dipping temperatures (1, 20, 40, and 50  C) and then optimal condition (3 min at 50  C) was applied against foodborne pathogens on the carrots. When compared to the untreated control, treatment AcEW most effectively reduced the numbers of total bacteria, yeast and fungi, followed by AlEW and 100 ppm @sm$ NaOCl @/sm$. Exposure to all treatments for 3 min significantly reduced the numbers of total bacteria, yeast and fungi on the carrots. As the dipping temperature increased from 1  C to 50  C, the reductions of total bacteria, yeast and fungi increased significantly from 0.22 to 2.67 log CFU/g during the wash treatment (p <= 0.05). The combined 1% citric acid and AlEW treatment at 50  C showed a reduction of the total bacterial count and the yeast and fungi of around 3.7 log CFU/g, as well as effective reduction of L. monocytogenes (3.97 log CFU/g), and @gm$ E. Coli O157:H7 @/gm$ (4 log CFU/g).	3
Significantly higher abundance of Anaerotruncus, Oscillibacter, Ruminococcus torques, and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ were found in AMD patients, whereas Bacteroides eggerthii was detected in higher abundance in healthy controls. By examining the metabolic functions and pathways related to the altered intestinal microbiome, a reduction in bacteria responsible for fatty acid elongation, and an increase in bacteria responsible for L-alanine fermentation, @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ degradation, and arginine biosynthesis were found in AMD patients. @sm$ Glutamate @/sm$, arginine, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may play roles in retina physiology as well as in the pathogenesis of AMD.	2
Similar findings were reported in 2022 for MucR of another representative of Brucella species, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, which is a non-zoonotic bacterium causing contagious epididymitis and other lesions in rams, which leads to significant economic losses in sheep-breeding areas. It is naturally rough due to the lack of O chains in @sm$ LPS @/sm$.	1
Similar results were found in a @sm$ 6-hydroxydopamine @/sm$ (@sm$ 6-OHDA @/sm$) and rotenone induced PD rat model receiving 30 or 100mumol/kg NaHS (an H2S donor). Similarly, H2 another and potentially overlooked gasotransmitter, which can be produced by gut microbiota, such as Blautia sp. Clostridium spp., might have an important link to PD as it has been described to neutralize toxic hydroxyl radicals, downregulate the expression of proinflammatory factors, and preserve cerebrovascular reactivity. Intriguingly, 0.08 ppm of H2 in drinking water reduced the loss dopaminergic neurons by 16% compared to the control in the substantia nigra and slightly improved the mobility in an open-field test using a MPTP induced PD mouse model. Similarly, the protection of dopaminergic neurons, by drinking hydrogenated water, was also observed in a @sm$ 6-OHDA @/sm$ rat model. Bacterial species representing the genera of bacteria altered in PD have been tested for their production of H2. @gm$ Blautia coccoides @/gm$ and Clostridium leptum, which are reported to be underrepresented in PD patients (Table 1) produced the highest levels of H2 (~1.6 and 0.62mumol/108 cells), and therefore might contribute to the availability of molecular H2 which potentially plays a role in neuroprotection.	1
Similarly to  @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ , JE7A12T shows narrow specialization with regards to carbohydrate fermentation, while other members of the genus  Ruminococcus  generally ferment a wider range of carbohydrates. Specifically,  @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$  has been reported to ferment most of the same carbon sources as JE7A12T, including galactose, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, fructose, maltose, glycogen and starch. Despite the similarities between the species, strains of  @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$  derived from the bovine rumen are not known to ferment fructose or galactose and are rarely able to ferment @sm$ glucose @/sm$. Utilization of these carbon sources have more commonly been observed in human derived  @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ . Therefore, fermentation of @sm$ glucose @/sm$, fructose and galactose could act to differentiate JE7A12T from ruminally derived  @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ .	2
Similarly, @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ lactifermentans was positively correlated with all of these parameters, except plasma triglyceride content. Desulfovibrionaceae (i.e., Bilophila and Desulfovibrio, both gram-negative bacteria) were less prevalent in the prebiotic-treated mice. Interestingly, two recent studies demonstrate that diet-induced obesity and diabetes are associated with a bloom of this family. Some members of Desulfovibrionaceae, shown to be involved in gut barrier disruption, are able to reduce sulfate to @sm$ H2S. @/sm$ In agreement with these reports, we found a very strong correlation between gut permeability and the abundance of Streptococcus intermedius.	1
Similarly, a major function of acyl-ACP synthetases in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis and Synechococcus seems to consist in the recycling of endogenous @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$. In contrast, the intracellular parasite Chlamydia trachomatis, pathogenic Neisseria, or the Bacteroidete @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ from the human gut microbiome use their acyl-ACP synthetases to scavenge host @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ in order to incorporate them into their membrane lipids.	2
Similarly, a previous study reported that the free phenolic content varied during fermentation of whole-grain barley when different species of @gm$ lactobacillus @/gm$ were used. Table 1 tabulates the amino acid, sugar and organic acid content of GY and SY. Briefly, GY comprised seven amino acids including GABA, glutamine, alanine, histidine, proline, @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ and valine, while SY comprised only four amino acids including GABA, alanine, histidine and choline.	0
Similarly, components of Thymus vulgaris essential oils reduced the transfer of the bla-carrying pKM101 plasmid between @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ strains. The highest reduction was observed as an effect of @sm$ linalool @/sm$ supplementation, followed by S- and R-carvone, eugenol, and borneol.	3
Similarly, lactate-utilizing bacteria prefer @sm$ glucose @/sm$ over lactate when both are available. These substrate preferences are often strain-specific, reflecting differences in metabolic pathways. Strain metabolic output also differs with environmental context. Certain bacteria can generate formate, a common intermediate metabolite, but under specific pH conditions the same microorganisms can further metabolize it and generate gaseous hydrogen instead. In situations where formate-producing bacteria are paired with hydrogen-dependent microbes such as @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, formate is also further metabolized to acetate and energy harvest is maximized.	2
Similarly, petroleum ether, @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$, and methanol extracts from the stem bark and leaves exhibited antimicrobial activity against selective microbes among Gram-positive bacteria, that is, B. polymyxa, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, S. lutea, and S. aureus; Gram-negative bacteria such as @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, V.	3
Similarly, the @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ lrgAB operon also appears to play a role in pyruvate import. Although @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ is unable to grow with pyruvate as the sole carbon source, an lrgAB mutant was defective in pyruvate consumption upon entry into stationary phase. Interestingly, the plant lrgAB homolog PLGG1 has been shown to be important modulator of cell death, as well as being involved in the transport of glycerate and @sm$ glycolate @/sm$ during photorespiration.	2
Similarly, while no significant differences were seen in propionate level, an elevated @sm$ acetate @/sm$ level was observed in the gut of disease cohorts. These results suggest that amongst the three bacteria-derived SCFA's, butyrate might play a significant role in determining the gut health status of an individual. This is supported by higher occurrence of butyrate producing bacteria, like Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, and Roseburia in the guts of healthy individuals.	1
Since @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ colonizes the large intestinal surface and the intestine is recognized as the initial site of infection, it is postulated that antigen specific IgA may play a role in the protection against the colonization of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ in the intestine. However, within these studies, we did not determine if antigen specific IgA was present in the gut at time of challenge. Challenge studies, using both acute and relapsing models of disease in mice showed that vaccination did not influence colonization or persistence. The failure of this approach suggests that either immunity to the glycosylated BclA3 protein is not protective, however, it could also indicate that presentation of the antigen is insufficient to stimulate sufficient levels of immunity to drive protection. Recently, Broecker, et al. and Monteiro reported protection against C. difficile was achievable by vaccination using glycans of the surface polysaccharides of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$, @sm$ PS-I @/sm$, PS-II, and PS-III.	0
Since GABA and @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ are important molecules linking the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways, the consumption or production of 36 compounds including glucose, SCFA, amino acids, and biogenic amines was measured in the supernatants of mYCFA and mYCFA-@sm$ Glu @/sm$ cultures (Supplementary Data File 1). As expected, a significant correlation (r = -0.99; p < 0.001) between @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ and GABA levels was observed, further highlighting the nature of @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ as primary precursor of GABA. However, no other metabolites strongly correlated with GABA levels (-0.60 <= r <= 0.65; Supplementary Figure S2). @sm$ Glutamate @/sm$ was primarily consumed for the production of GABA, with high GABA yield coefficients (YGABA/@sm$ Glu @/sm$) ranging from 0.769 to 0.993 (mol/mol) after 48 h for the high producers B. faecis PB-SESWS, B. fragilis PB-SZSJC, B. ovatus DSM 1896, and @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ @gm$ DSM 18836 @/gm$. B. plebeius PB-SLKZP was the only strain accumulating @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ (Supplementary Table S1). The final pH was variable across strains, ranging from 4.8 (B. vulgatus DSM 1447, mYCFA) to 6.4 (B. ovatus DSM 1896, mYCFA-@sm$ Glu @/sm$), and correlated with @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ (r = -0.82; p < 0.001) and GABA (r = 0.85; p < 0.001) levels (Supplementary Figure S3), thus providing initial evidence of the association between GABA production and pH regulation in Bacteroides.	2
Since gut microbiota can both produce (e.g., Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus) and use (e.g., @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Eubacterium siraeum) BCAAs, the greater fecal BCAA levels represented a net result from the bacteria biosynthesis and catabolism of BCAAs. It is well established that BCAAs share common biosynthetic pathways all stemming from intermediates from pyruvate metabolism, a central component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which perfectly links the metabolism of @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, amino acids, and lipids.	2
Since the acidic environment of the stomach is an important protection barrier against foodborne pathogen infections in hosts, we evaluated whether TolC played a role in the acid tolerance of @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$. Comparison of the acid tolerance of the tolC mutant and the parental wild-type strain showed that the absence of TolC limits the ability of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ to sustain life under extreme acidic conditions. Additionally, the mutant exhibited morphological changes during growth in an acidic medium, leading to the conflicting results of cell viability measured by spectrophotometry and colony-forming unit counting. Reverse-transcriptional-PCR analysis indicated that acid-related molecules, apparatus, or enzymes and oxidation-induced factors were significantly affected by the acidic environment in the null-tolC mutant. The elongated cellular morphology was restored by adding antioxidants to the culture medium. Furthermore, we found that increased cellular antioxidative activity provides an overlapping protection against acid killing, demonstrating the complexity of the bacterial acid stress response. Our findings reinforce the multifunctional characteristics of TolC in acid tolerance or oxidative stress resistance and support the correlative protection mechanism between @sm$ oxygen @/sm$- and acid-mediated stress responses in @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$.	3
Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and @sm$ paramonochlorophenol @/sm$ (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica.	3
Sinigrin hydrolysis by plant or bacterial myrosinase yields @sm$ allyl isothiocyanate @/sm$ (@sm$ AITC @/sm$) which is bactericidal. In silico analysis using public databases found sequence similarity between plant myrosinase and enzymes encoded by genes from beta-glucosidase families in @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$. Specifically, 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase encoded by the genes bglA and ascB (family 1), and chbF (family 4) present in @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ showed the highest similarity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of bglA, ascB, and chbF in the clinical E. coli strain tested. Disruption of these genes in wild-type E. coli O157:H7 strain 02-0304 using lambda-red replacement created single and double mutants. The relative importance of each gene in the hydrolysis of sinigrin by @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ was also assessed by comparing gene expression and sinigrin degradation rates among the @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ wild-type strain and its mutants.	1
Six microorganisms that produced acetoin or @sm$ diacetyl @/sm$ or both from glucose were tested for the production of 2,3-butylene glycol from lactose. Bacillus polymyxa and @gm$ Streptococcus faecalis @/gm$ gave positive results and were tested in unmodified wheys. Cottage cheese whey was unsatisfactory, but B. polymyxa produced large amounts of the glycol in sweet whey, about 60 mmol of glycol per 100 mmol of lactose utilized. Aeration and an increased ratio of surface area to volume of whey enhanced the production of glycol. 2,3-Butylene was separated from the spent whey and from acetoin and @sm$ diacetyl @/sm$ with a Sephadex G-10 column.	1
Six strains of serotypes 1 or 2 of @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ were isolated from dead squirrel monkeys, a cotton-top tamarin and a marmoset hybrid. All strains harboured a 71.6 kb plasmid, all were totally oxacillin-resistant and partially resistant to cephalosporins. Biochemically, serotypes 1 and 2 differed from each other in their beta-galactosidase production in a nonfermenter system, whereas the lack of rhamnose, maltose, salicin and @sm$ trehalose @/sm$ fermentation seemed to be attributable to technical causes.	2
Slackia equolifaciens and @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ convert the @sm$ stilbenes @/sm$, resveratrol to dihydroresveratrol (DHR) (stilbenoid) through hydrogenation.	1
Slender, straight, or slightly rod Gram-positive bacteria were selected and biochemically confirmed using standard laboratory methods (catalase and oxidase activities, H2S production, motility, and @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ fermentation on triple sugar iron agar [TSI] [Merck, Germany]) and H2S, Indole, and Motility (SIM medium) (Merck, Germany) were used to confirm @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp. The putative Gram-positive bacilli confirmed as @gm$ Erysipelothrix @/gm$ spp.	2
Smooth-to-rough phase variation can spontaneously occur in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ smooth strains as result of environmental factors but the molecular mechanism responsible for such variation has not yet been defined. Owing to the lack of antigenic O-PS, true R-mutants neither induce anti O-PS antibodies which could interfere with a serologic diagnosis of brucellosis, nor react with anti-O-PS antibodies. In addition, these mutants show outer membrane morphological and physiological changes resulting in the uptake of @sm$ crystal violet @/sm$ and the autoagglutination in acriflavine solution. With the exception of @gm$ B.ovis @/gm$ and B.canis, which are rough but virulent, R-mutants are less virulent than the wild type.	3
Snippy uses the Burrows-Wheelers Aligner and SAMtools to align reads of the 53 NZ @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$ isolates to our reference genome Legionella longbeachae F1157CHC and FreeBayes to identify variants among the alignments. Gubbins was used to remove areas of recombination on the full alignment. SNPs were exported into BEAUti v2.5 to create an Extensive Markup Language (xml) file for BEAST v2.5. The @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$ reference genome consists of 1,306,681 adenine, 765,717 cytosine, 772,189 guanine and 1,298,289 @sm$ thymine @/sm$. These nucleotides were added as constant sites to keep the model representative of @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$.	0
So far, studies on the effect of @sm$ flavones @/sm$ on gut microbiota are lacking. However, studies reporting the beneficial role of other flavonoids as potent gut microbiota modifiers are emerging. For example, quercetin reduced the microbiota composition including the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and the growth of species associated with diet-induced obesity like Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacillus, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$, while restoring the barrier integrity in obese NAFLD model. In HFD/high sucrose-induced obesity models, polyphenol-rich cranberry extract diet and concord grape anthocyanins inhibited insulin resistance and inflammation by mediating an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut microbiota. Anthocyanins from plum and peach juices decreased fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), a subset of key gut microbiota metabolites, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and modified the bacterial composition of the microbiota, by increasing the population of Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroidetes. Several flavonoids are shown to enrich beneficial bacterial abundance while reducing potential detrimental microbes in the human gut. Quercetin and resveratrol decreased the Enterobacteriaceae family and reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the human gut, as shown through the 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples. Diet supplementation with soy bars significantly enhances the abundance of beneficial Bifidobacterium bacteria in postmenopausal women, which results in increased lipid catabolism. The ability of other flavonoids to regulate dysbiosis establishes a promising platform, urging the investigation of the potential of @sm$ flavones @/sm$ in the regulation of the gut microbiota.	3
Some Ruminococcus species are non-cellulolytic, including @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and Ruminococcus bicirculans. @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$ can ferment saccharides and its major fermentation products are succinate and acetate, with a less amount of formate, @sm$ lactate @/sm$, and pyruvate.	1
Some antigens containing structures comprising exactly those found in the @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ O:9 OPS, with no Brucella unique components, gave DSp and AUC values better than expected. These were, in descending order of DSp and AUC, the Mono (1), the 2,2-Tri (5) and 2,2,2,2,2-Hexa (9) antigens. Each gave DSp and AUC values higher than all native antigens; the sLPS and modified OPS. The ranking of these antigens suggests that the terminal D-Rha4NFo not only facilitates sensitive antibody detection but does so in a relatively specific manner and that addition of further alpha1,2-linked D-Rha4NFo units decreases specificity. This further suggests that epitopes comprising linear alpha1,2 D-Rha4NFo sequences are less specific to Brucella infection, compared to infection with @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ O:9. However, the tip epitope only appears to be more specific after the initial induction of antibodies following @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ O:9 infection (Figure 4). Although the results from the @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ O:9 samples generally fall over time for all antigens, the fall-off is quicker with the shorter oligosaccharide antigens, slower with the longer antigens and @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and with the mOPS antigens even initially increasing.	2
Some authors have reported the antibacterial activities of the petroleum ether, chloroform, @sm$ ethyl-acetate @/sm$ extracts of S. rhombifolia on Gram-positive (B. subtilis, B. megaterium, S. aureus and S. lutea) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella. Sp., P. aeruginosa, @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$, S. sonnei and S. boydii . The broad antimicrobial activity of the extract (1v:4v) in our study can be attributed to the presence of various bio-actives components such as tannins, polyphenols, alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, steroids and saponins found in this extract. Two glycosides (phenyl-Ethyl-D-glucopyranoside and Phytoecdysteroide) exhibited different biological activities were isolated from the extract of the seeds of S. rhombifolia respectively. The variation observed of the diameters of inhibition zone of the bacteria tested can be attributed either to the difference in the composition of the bio-active molecules present in the extract or to their mechanism of action on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism of action of the glycosides, polyphenols, tannins and alkaloids on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was demonstrated. The MICs of the most sensitive isolate to the aqueous-methanol extract (1v:4v) varied from 49.40 to 78.30 mug/ml. The antibacterial property of @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ and K. pneumoniae is well documented. Several studies reported that S. rhombifolia is traditionally used to treat gonorrhoea (India) and diarrhoea (Cameroon). The anti-inflammatory and hepato-protective activities of the methanol extract of the aerial parts and aqueous extract of the roots and aerial parts of S. rhombifolia have been demonstrated. Both cytotoxicity and antibacterial activities of the @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$ of extract of S.	3
Some bacteria decreased only in the responders (e.g., Alistipes putredenis, Alistipes shahii, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$), while some increased among them (Streptococcus mitis group, Lachnospiraceae bacterium). Among the bacteria with the strongest correlation with improved glucose and insulin homeostasis were Ruminococcus gnavus, Alistipes shahii, Streptococcus mitis group, Eubacterium hallii and Escherichia coli, the abundance of which were also differently changed in responders and non-responders. Liu et al. continued the study further with the functional and metabolomic analyses of the GM, showing segregation of functional variations and pathways according to the response to exercise. The amino acid fermentation was shifted towards the production of metabolically harmful components and colonic gases in the non-responders, while in the responders towards the production of SCFA. In terms of insulin sensitivity, several other important metabolic adaptations in the GM were found to differentiate the two exercise-responsive groups. The results were confirmed by using a random forest algorithm, to screen those differences in the GM and metabolites at the baseline, which would most efficiently predict the exercise response. Those were @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, B. cellulosilyticus and @sm$ GABA @/sm$.	0
Some carbohydrate fermentation products, including lactate, succinate and @sm$ 1,2-propanediol @/sm$, do not usually accumulate to high levels in the human colon of healthy adults, as they can serve as substrates for other bacteria, including propionate and butyrate producers. For example, acetate produced by fermentation of resistant starch by R. bromii or lactate produced by lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria provides substrate for other microbiota members such as Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae which convert it into butyrate. Recently, @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ has been demonstrated to perform extracellular digestion of inulin at its own cost, but at an advantage to other species which provide reciprocal benefits.	2
Some glucans, including beta-glucan, can promote the growth of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ as it is capable of decomposing dietary @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$.	2
Some gut microbes such as Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$ species Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, and Lactococcus garvieae specialize in metabolizing these phyto-estrogenic compounds. An isoflavone-rich (ISO) diet consists of the key compounds @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ and genistein which are metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce biologically active S-equol to exert numerous health benefits.	1
Some gut microbes such as Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$ species Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, and Lactococcus garvieae specialize in metabolizing these phyto-estrogenic compounds. An isoflavone-rich (ISO) diet consists of the key compounds daidzein and @sm$ genistein @/sm$ which are metabolized by the gut microbiota to produce biologically active S-equol to exert numerous health benefits.	1
Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to be able to metabolize soybean daidzein @sm$ isoflavone @/sm$ into equol and/or O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), such as Lactobacillus mucosae, Bifidobacterium spp., Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, Bacteroides ovatus, Eggerthella spp. strain YY7918, Eggerthella spp. Julong 732, Enterococcus faecium, @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, and Slackia equolifaciens. However, only about 30-50% of individuals have intestinal bacteria capable of synthesizing equol. The transformation of @sm$ isoflavone @/sm$ into equol is directly related to patient diet, the composition and fermentation capacity of the intestinal microbiota, as well as the oxidation-reduction reactions carried out in the intestine.	1
Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to be able to metabolize soybean daidzein isoflavone into equol and/or @sm$ O-desmethylangolensin @/sm$ (@sm$ O-DMA @/sm$), such as Lactobacillus mucosae, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp., Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, Bacteroides ovatus, Eggerthella spp.	1
Some members of these bacterial taxa were involved in the degradation of plant @sm$ cellulose @/sm$, hemicellulose, and chitin. At OTU level, those microbes belonging to @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$, Akkermansia and Eubacterium were enriched in the young sheep. Some members of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ have also been isolated from human feces, and are associated with host immune response. For example, the strain @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ may activate anti-cancer immune response of spleen T cell, and thus inhibit tumor growth and improve chemotherapy effect.	2
Some methanogenic archaea, such as Methanobrevibacter smithii , @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$  and Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus  that we recently isolated from two human stool specimens (S. Khelaifia and M. Drancourt, unpublished data) were reported to require ruminal fluid for growth. Methanosphaera stadtmanae  has the most restricted energy metabolism of all known human-associated methanogenic archaea, generating methane through the reduction of @sm$ methanol @/sm$ with H2 and being strictly dependent on acetate as a carbon source.	2
"Some of the detected sessile microbiota-specific species, such as @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$, Parabacteroides distasonis, Rikenellaceae sp., Finegoldia sp., Bilophila sp., and Pyramidobacter piscolens, have previously been reported to be associated with colonic biofilms on intestinal biliary stents. The relative abundances of lifestyle-specific species were generally below 1%, except for Pyramidobacter piscolens (Synergistetes), which contributed 10% of all 16S rRNA gene reads to sessM_F1, and Bilophila sp. (Proteobacteria), with a relative abundance of 12% in sessM_F2. The occurrence of these two species in the sessile microbiota points at trophic interactions. Pyramidobacter sp. and Bilophila sp. are phylogenetically different but exhibit similar physiologies. Both genera are asaccharolytic amino acid degraders that mainly produce acetate as well as small amounts of isovalerate, isobutyrate and @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$. P. piscolens, rarely cultivated in vitro, was successfully isolated from dental plaque communities in coculture with Methanobrevibacter massiliense, suggesting a symbiotic relationship where P. piscolens uses methane produced by M. massiliense to form @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$. Indeed, Methanobrevibacter sp. was exclusively found in sessM_F1 at a relative abundance of 2% and was the only representative of the archaeal community (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Similarly, Bilophila wadsworthia was previously recovered in mixed cultures, where growth depended on a ""helper strain"" producing essential growth-promoting factors (quinones). Several bacteria can act as ""helpers"" supplying quinones, including @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, and different Bacteroides species. Among those bacterial species, here @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ was uniquely present in sessM (Fig."	1
Some of the sugars available to enteric pathogens as food sources include fucose, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine, Neu5Ac, mannose, glucose, @sm$ glucuronate @/sm$, gluconate and galacturonate. Neu5Ac is an excellent source of carbon and energy for intestinal commensals and pathogens, thus it is not surprising that there are a number of commensal species that encode the genes required to utilize Neu5Ac as a carbon source, such as, Bacteroides caccae, B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. uniformis, B. vulgatus, Parabacteroides distasonis,, B. breve, Escherichia coli, E. blattae, Edwardsiella tarda, Dorea formicigenerans, @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Ruminococcus gnavus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L.	2
Some researchers have reported that HN-AD bacteria can oxidise ammonium to nitrate or @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ and convert these products to N2O and/or N2 by denitrification. Therefore, NO2--N and NO3--N accumulated in the culture process but were gradually consumed after rapid growth. In this study, the concentration of NO3--N in the culture medium first increased and then decreased, before finally accumulating to a certain amount. In the process of removing NH4+-N by Acinetobacter sp. T1, NO3--N had a similar change trend. A small amount of NO2--N accumulated in the medium during the reaction, which may be because NO2--N is an intermediate product. It is inferred that the dissimilatory ammonia nitrogen removal pathway of strain K17 may be, leaving the NO3--N (or NO2--N) to be reduced to gaseous nitrogen. However, some HN-AD bacteria, such as Cupriavidus sp. S1, Acinetobacter sp. and @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, did not detect (or was very low levels) NO3--N, NO2--N during ammonia removal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa DBT1BNH3 grew well in the presence of nitrate, but no @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ was detected.	2
Some species (Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes indistinctus, Clostridium leptum, Eggerthella lenta, @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Streptococcus oralis) were also predicted to harbor four or more ARG subtypes. Other bacterial species were speculated to carry three or one ARG subtypes. For instance, K. pneumoniae carried one ARG subtypes to fosfomycin (fosA), Prevotella copri carried one ARG subtype to tetracycline (tet37), and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum carried three ARG subtypes to @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ (vanH and vanD) and MLS (ermT).	4
Some species such as @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ possess both heterotrophic and autotrophic properties and can use CO, H2/CO2, and carbohydrates as energy sources. Carbohydrate utilization experiments have shown that all Blautia strains can use glucose, but different strains showed different abilities to use sucrose, fructose, lactose, maltose, rhamnose, and raffinose (Table 2). The final products of glucose fermentation by Blautia are @sm$ acetic acid @/sm$, succinic acid, lactic acid, and ethanol, and the main biochemical tests have revealed negative results for lecithin, lipase, catalase, and indole.	1
Some strains can consume xylose or other sugars, such as glucose, saccharose, fructose, @sm$ lactose @/sm$, or arabinose. R. flavefaciens produces formate, acetate, and succinate. The production of lactate and ethanol by this species is strain dependent and its DNA G + C content is 39%-44%. R. albus consumes xylose, glucose, saccharose, @sm$ lactose @/sm$, mannose, and fructose, depending on the strain. This species produces formate, ethanol, and acetate, and some strains can produce lactate, succinate, and dihydrogen in small quantities. Its DNA content is 42.6%-45.8%. @gm$ R. champanellensis @/gm$ ferments cellulose and xylane and metabolizes cellobiose to acetate, succinate, dihydrogen, ethanol, and small quantities of formate and lactate. Its DNA G + C content is 53.07%. The type strain of @gm$ R. champanellensis @/gm$ from human feces is 18P13, which is the only strain studied to date.	2
Some studies have shown that prebiotics has positive effects on metabolic markers and immunomodulatory properties because they induce the growth of both @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus, which in turn produce an important reduction in fasting plasma @sm$ glucose @/sm$, serum TG, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, and a significant increase in HDL cholesterol levels.	1
Some studies have shown the effect of stress-related hormones such as CRF, ACTH, @sm$ catecholamines @/sm$, and cortisol produced through the SAM and HPA axis on the gut microbiota. Most of these hormones are released into the gut through circulation. Hormones such as CRF and cortisol is produced in small amount in the gut by enteric neurons, enterochromaffin cells, and epithelial cells of the gut. The direct effect of @sm$ catecholamines @/sm$ on gut bacteria such as @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella enetrica has been previously demonstrated. The effect of cortisol on gut microbiome was shown in pigs where gut Ruminococcus negatively predicted the level of serum cortisol. The serum cortisol fully mediated the relationship between fecal Ruminococcus and a brain metabolite N-acetyl aspartate which highlighted the role of the gut-brain axis. Post-stressor salivary cortisol in humans was negatively associated with the alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota. This direct interaction of stress-related hormones with microbiota has been commonly termed microbial endocrinology. Stress hormones may also affect the gut microbiota through the modulation of host epithelium. ACTH, @sm$ catecholamines @/sm$, and cortisol are known to increase the adherence of bacteria to gut mucosa as well contribute to the uptake of microbiota into Peyer's patches.	3
Some water quality measurements have been suggested as alternative approaches to predict the @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ risk for building's water system instead of directly culturing analysis. However, as reported in the study of Pierre and collaborators, a poor correlation and a low positive predictive value between the hot water return line and distal outlet positivity in different buildings was revealed. Moreover, no correlation between @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ distal site positivity and total bacteria, pH, free chlorine, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, copper, temperature, total organic @sm$ carbon @/sm$, or incoming cold-water chlorine concentration was observed. These data confirm that these water quality parameters should not be used alone to determine the building's @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ colonization rate and effectiveness of water management programs.	0
Spearman analysis showed that four species, including Prevotella fusca and Prevotella melaninogenica, were negatively correlated with age of the subjects while three species, including @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ and S. thermophilus, had a negative association. In addition, seven species, including Thermococcus gammatolerans and Burkholderia diffusa were negatively correlated, whereas ten species including @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ and S. thermophilus had a positive relationship with BMI (Figure 6B). Furthermore, seven species, including Prevotella denticola and P. melaninogenica, were positively correlated with @sm$ testosterone @/sm$ levels, whereas only @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ was negatively correlated with @sm$ testosterone @/sm$ levels.	3
Spearman correlation analysis revealed that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$, showed significantly negative associations with LPC(18:0) (P = 0.020 and P = 0.011, respectively), and other metabolites participating in glycerophospholipid metabolism [LPC(16:0), PC(16:0/18:1), PC(16:0/16:0), phosphatidic acid 16:0/18:1 {PA(16:0/18:1)}, PC(18:0/18:1)]. Inversely, these metabolites were positively correlated with the Dorea and Parabacteroides genera and the Mogibacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae families. Notably, the abundances of these bacterial taxa were remarkably decreased by GML supplementation compared with their abundances in the HFD control. @sm$ Linoleic acid @/sm$, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, was present at a relatively high concentration in the sera of HFD-fed rats and showed negative correlations with the abundances of the Allobaculum (P = 0.003) and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (P = 0.047) genera and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ (P = 0.036). The increase in serum acetoacetic acid was associated with higher abundances of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (P < 0.001) and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ (P < 0.001) and lower abundances of the Bacteroides (P = 0.003) and Eggerthella (P = 0.002) genera and E. lenta (P = 0.002). Additionally, palmitoylcarnitine was positively correlated with @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (P = 0.003) and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ (P = 0.002) but negatively associated with the Dorea (P = 0.009) genus and the Mogibacteriaceae (P = 0.004) and Clostridiaceae (P = 0.003) families.	3
Spearman correlation analysis revealed that metabolites including nucleotides, @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, peptides, cofactors and vitamins, xenobiotics, amino acids, and lipids were closely correlated with genera mainly belonging to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla. Previous studies in fish and mammals have reported the involvement of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis and de novo synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins. This suggests that supplementation of GOS and @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ in the diet could have modulated gut microbiota associated with some of those functions in the post-smolt Atlantic salmon in the present study as well. Further, increased transcripts and metabolite levels related to immunomodulatory effects could also potentially link to the increased abundance of @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ when in combination with GOS.	1
Speciation of 41 isolates which were difficult to distinguish as either alpha or beta hemolytic on sheep blood agar plates showed that the majority were either @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ or S. mitis (31.7 % each). S. oralis, S. pneumoniae, S. constellatus, and S. perioris accounted for 7.3, 4.9, 2.4, and 2.4 % of these strains, respectively. However, 19.5 % @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$-susceptible isolates could not be classified further. Most @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ (84.6 %) and about half of S. mitis (54.5 %) were similarly @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$-sensitive.	3
Species belonging to the genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Paraprevotella, Alloprevotella, Barnesiella, and Tannerella are saccharolytic, while species belonging to Odoribacter and Porphyromonas are predominantly asaccharolytic. Some Bacteroides spp. and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. can degrade complex plant polysaccharides such as starch, @sm$ cellulose @/sm$, xylans, and pectins.	2
Species producing industrially-relevant alcohols include Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans, which ferments cellulose to ethanol at 68% of the maximum theoretical yield and, similar to @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$, metabolizes fucose and rhamnose to @sm$ 1-propanol @/sm$ through a 1,2-propanediol intermediate in polyhedral microcompartments.	1
Species were chosen for their ability to degrade xylans (Bacteroides ovatus, Eubacterium siraeum, Roseburia intestinalis, Roseburia faecis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens), other hemicelluloses (Ruminococcus bicirculans, Eubacterium rectale, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$) or @sm$ pectin @/sm$ (B.	2
Specific BV-associated bacteria were correlated with the presence of amino acid catabolites, whereas @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ and L. jensenii were associated with the presence of intact amino acids and dipeptides. These data support the notion that BV-associated bacteria may use amino acids as a carbon and @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ source, in contrast to lactobacilli, which are known to metabolize sugars, such as glycogen. In line with our findings, another study that performed comparative analysis of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ genomes from the human vagina suggested that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ genomes were underrepresented in amino acid transport and metabolism, while being overrepresented for carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Furthermore, genome analysis of L. iners AB-1 showed that it lacks genes necessary for the de novo synthesis of amino acids, with the possible exception of serine, and that ~15% of its genome is dedicated to various transport mechanisms, suggesting that it acquires metabolites, such as amino acids, crucial for survival from the environment. This is consistent with our observations that the metabolite profile of L. iners is intermediate to those of @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$/L.	2
Specific intestinal microflora can convert @sm$ ETs @/sm$ and EA consumed by some people into urolithins. Selma et al. reported that the abundance of Gordonibacter in the feces of UM-A individuals was higher than those of UM-B and UM-0 individuals. In addition, two strains from the genus Gordonibacter with a Uro-C-producing ability were identified: G. urolithinfaciens and @gm$ G. pamelaeae @/gm$.	1
Specifically, bacterial taxa typical of the 1-6 M group intestinal microbiota together with certain bacterial species characterizing the other two age groups positively correlated with at least one complex plant-derived glycan, such as inulin, pectin, arabinogalactan, @sm$ maltodextrin @/sm$, guar gum or xylan (Supplementary Table 12). Notably, members of the genus Bifidobacterium are skilled degraders of a wide range of plant-derived carbohydrates due to the presence, in their genetic arsenal, of several genes dedicated to this activity, while they also participate in intra- and inter-genus cross-feeding behaviour. Similarly, members of the genera @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella and Ruminococcus are known for their ability to utilize different complex sugars as energy source.	2
Specifically, the majority of Enterobacteriaceae were characterized by a significant @sm$ Zn @/sm$-induced increase in relative abundance. Additionally, bacterial species with relative abundance of >1%, @sm$ Zn @/sm$ exposure resulted in a significant increase in Weissella cibaria, Weissella confusa, @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$, and Streptococcus equinus. In contrast, the most abundant species @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ reuteri decreased from 45% to 18% in response to @sm$ Zn @/sm$ exposure. Lastly, a significant increase in intestinal microbiota richness and relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, with a parallel decrease in Ruminococcus flavefaciens was observed in response to coated nano ZnO supplementation. Interestingly, the effect of @sm$ Zn @/sm$ on the gut microbiota in weaned piglets seems to be specific for intestinal sites. For example, ZnO nanoparticle (ZnONP) supplementation significantly reduced bacterial abundance and diversity in ileum with increases in Streptococcus and decreases in Lactobacillus numbers. In turn, cecal and colonic microflora biodiversity and abundance were increased, with a specific elevation in Lactobacillus numbers and a decrease in Oscillospira and Prevotella abundance. ZnONP-induced modulation of gut microbiome was associated with increased expression of tight junction and antioxidant proteins, as well as reduced IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma mRNA expression due to inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling, altogether resulting in lower incidence of diarrhea. @sm$ Zn @/sm$ has also been shown to modulate microbial metabolite production in pigs.	3
Sphingolipids accounted for 19-29% of the total @sm$ lipids @/sm$ detected in Bacteroides species, with DHCer making up approximately 20% of the sphingolipid fraction in @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$, B. vulgatus, and B. thetaiotaomicron, but only 2% in B. fragilis. Instead, B. fragilis appeared to accumulate higher levels of keto-sphinganine (keto-sph). Additionally, detectable levels of sphinganine (sph) and deoxy-sph were found in both B. thetaiotaomicron and @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$.	1
SrtA is a virulence factor in oral gram-positive species, including Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ spp.. SrtA in S. mutans is essential for sucrose-independent adhesion, which facilitates the antigen I/II and Gbps attachment to the cell wall, while the srtA gene expression in S. mutans was downregulated by approximately one-fold after curcumin treatment. SrtA in @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ spp. has played a key role in bacterial survival and is the potential treatment target to combat @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ spp.. Berberine, one of the main alkaloids isolated from Rhizoma coptidis, inhibited SrtA gene expression by 50% compared with the control group at 80 mug/ml. SrtA in Staphylococcus spp. also acts as a catalyst for the adhesion of proteins (such as FnBPA and FnBPB) to the cell wall. Kaempferol, a typical @sm$ flavonol @/sm$, inhibited both SrtA activity and cell adhesion at 64 mug/ml, suggesting that its inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved by inhibiting SrtA activity to weaken the adhesion of S.	3
Stages of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ growth in optimal laboratory broth culture conditions have been previously described. Pure cultures of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$, strain OxCC13, were grown anaerobically at 37 C in 100 ml Schaedler broth (SBO, BD Biosciences) supplemented with 100 mM @sm$ sodium oxalate @/sm$ and 10 mM sodium acetate. For generation of samples for proteomic analysis, @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ cells were taken at OD595 0.05 and 0.13 (n=4 each growth stage).	2
Standard solid media, i.e., MacConkey, xylose lysine deoxycholate, bismuth sulfite (Wilson-Blair), and @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-Shigella agars, as well as selenite and tetrathionate (Preuss) broths (all Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) were used to detect @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, Shigella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and Vibrio species. In addition, cefsulodin irgasan novobiocin agar, Skirrow agar supplemented with 10% sheep blood, PALCAM listeria agar, and cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (all Oxoid) were inoculated for the detection of Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and C. difficile, respectively. To detect Arcobacter butzleri, Skirrow agar plates were inoculated and cultured at 37 C. Suspicious bacterial colonies were further isolated and differentiated using routine techniques (e.g., oxidase, @sm$ hippurate @/sm$, and motility for Campylobacter spp. and A. butzleri, agglutination for @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and the API system (BioMerieux, Nurtingen, Germany).	0
Standard treatment includes oral @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$, which typically restores Lactobacillus species to dominance. However, recurrence rates are high; recurrent BV patients recur 3-4 times annually and are often refractory to treatment. Our previous qPCR-based study of recurrent BV patients pointed to putatively more virulent species of Gardnerella that were associated with refractory responses to oral @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$, and less robust recovery of Lactobacillus species associated with recurrence after an initial period of remission. However, these associations did not account for outcomes in all patients, suggesting that other bacterial species were involved. In this follow-up study, we sequenced the V4 domain of 16S rRNA sequences of 41of these same patients pre- and posttreatment. Overall compositions among pretreatment clinical outcome groups were not different, although alpha diversity significantly decreased: refractory > recurrent > remission. Combinations of key species were associated with and prognostic for outcome. Higher pretreatment abundance of Megasphaera lornae together with lower abundance of Gardnerella Gsp07 and Finegoldia magna predicted long term remission after oral @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$. Furthermore, a subset of refractory patients that did not have high levels of Gardnerella Gsp07, instead had elevated levels of alternative species including Atopobium vaginae, @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$ (@gm$ BVAB3 @/gm$), and Prevotella timonensis. Patients who recurred after transient remission had elevated abundance of species including Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella, and Aerococcus christensenii, compared to long-term remission patients. Core bacterial species among refractory patients did not change in abundance after @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$, suggesting resistance or tolerance, in contrast to the loss in abundance of the same species among recurrent or remission patients.	4
Statins can enhance the number of @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium longum subsp and their ability to produce butyrate Statins also increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Anaerobes, Broucella, and B. longum subsp (Figure 1). Statins are equally involved in the metabolism of the gut microbiota. The application of atorvastatin enhances the availability of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ in the gut, which in turn leads to an increase in L. reuteri, which then inhibits colorectal carcinogenesis by metabolizing @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ to indole-3-lactic acid.	2
Still, at the genus/species levels, several characteristic genera/species such as Propionibacterium, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces sp. oral taxon 448/414 increased significantly in S-ECC children, compared with the oral health group. Furthermore, we found that functional pathways involving glycolysis and acid production, such as starch and sucrose metabolism, @sm$ fructose @/sm$ and mannose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, were prominently up-regulated in the high-caries group.	2
Still, the Ruminococcus enterotype, with its associated co-occurring species @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ is also known to degrade intestinal mucins. Wu et al. confirmed the presence of Bacteroides and Prevotella enterotypes that remained stable over a 10-day study, but displayed changes in microbial composition within 24 h. Thus, only long-term host dietary practices were correlated with enterotype clustering. In contrast, David et al. reported on dietary-induced alterations of the gut microbiome in humans where, plant-based diets increased abundance of Firmicutes known to metabolize plant @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and animal-based diets increased abundance of bile-tolerant microbes.	2
Strain @gm$ AHN2437 @/gm$T (= @gm$ DSM 17242 @/gm$ = @gm$ CCUG 46020 @/gm$ = @gm$ JCM 16770 @/gm$) is the type strain of @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$. This strain is one of several strains with similar properties that were isolated mainly from pediatric patients with inflamed, gangrenous or non-inflamed appendices. Though the type strain @gm$ AHN2437 @/gm$T resembled members of the Bacteroides fragilis group in bile-resistance and positive @sm$ indole @/sm$ reaction, it was found, together with the type strain of Bacteroides putredinis, to form a separate phylogenetic lineage apart from authentic Bacteroides species.	1
Strain @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ 203 showed a different organization; in this case, no beta-lactamase-related genes were detected. Additionally, for this strain, Pfam detected a protein with a haem-degrading domain, which is related to @sm$ hemin @/sm$ or peroxide-based stress (Fig 2). Not much information was obtained for @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ strain 15518 since the organization shown in the figure was from a 3-kb contig.	3
Strain @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T exhibited oxidase, but no catalase activity. Using RAPID 32A identification strips (BioMerieux), positive reactions were observed for alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase. Negative reactions were observed for urease, arginine dihydrolase, alpha and beta-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase-6-phosphate, alpha-arabinosidase, beta-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosanimidase, mannose and raffinose fermentation, alpha-fucosidase, alkanine phosphatase, arginine arylamidase, proline arylamidase, leucyl glycine arylamidase, phenylalanine arylamidase, leucine arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, tyrosine arylamidase, alanine arylamidase, glycine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and serine arylamidase. Carbohydrate metabolism was examined using an API 50CH strip (BioMerieux). Positive reactions were observed for potassium gluconate, potassium 5-cetogluconate, aesculin, salicine, N-acetylglucosamine, and arbutine production, and L-arabinose, @sm$ D-ribose @/sm$, D-xylose, D-galactose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-mannitol, D-sorbitol, D-celiobiose, D-maltose, D-lactose, D-trehalose, gentiobiose, L-fucose and D-arabitol fermentation. Weak reactions were observed for amygdaline and potassium 2-cetogluconate production, and glycerol and D-arabinose fermentation. Table 2 summarizes the differential phenotypic characteristics of M. massiliensis, M. elsdenii and M. micronuciformis. M. massiliensis strain @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T was susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem and doxycycline but resistant to vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.	2
Strain @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T exhibited oxidase, but no catalase activity. Using RAPID 32A identification strips (BioMerieux), positive reactions were observed for alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase. Negative reactions were observed for urease, arginine dihydrolase, alpha and beta-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase-6-phosphate, alpha-arabinosidase, beta-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosanimidase, mannose and raffinose fermentation, alpha-fucosidase, alkanine phosphatase, arginine arylamidase, proline arylamidase, leucyl glycine arylamidase, phenylalanine arylamidase, leucine arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, tyrosine arylamidase, alanine arylamidase, glycine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and serine arylamidase. Carbohydrate metabolism was examined using an API 50CH strip (BioMerieux). Positive reactions were observed for potassium gluconate, potassium 5-cetogluconate, aesculin, salicine, N-acetylglucosamine, and arbutine production, and L-arabinose, D-ribose, D-xylose, @sm$ D-galactose @/sm$, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-mannitol, D-sorbitol, D-celiobiose, D-maltose, D-lactose, D-trehalose, gentiobiose, L-fucose and D-arabitol fermentation. Weak reactions were observed for amygdaline and potassium 2-cetogluconate production, and glycerol and D-arabinose fermentation. Table 2 summarizes the differential phenotypic characteristics of M. massiliensis, M. elsdenii and M. micronuciformis. M. massiliensis strain @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T was susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem and doxycycline but resistant to vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.	2
Strain HM2-2(T) was found to be related to Bifidobacterium catenulatum JCM 1194(T) (97.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity: 1480/1520 bp), Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum JCM 1200(T) (97.2 %: 1472/1514 bp), Bifidobacterium dentium ATCC 27534(T) (96.7 %: 1459/1509 bp) and @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$ ATCC 27535(T) (96.5 %: 1462/1515 bp). The predominant cellular @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ of strains HM2-1 and HM2-2(T) were 16 : 0 and 18 : 1omega9c, with proportions greater than 18 % of the total.	0
Strain Mz 5T and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster XIVa and were closely related to Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, Roseburia cecicola and Eubacterium rectale. The name proposed for this novel bacterium is Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is Mz 5T (=DSM 14809T =ATCC BAA-455T). Strain JK 615T produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. Glucose was fermented to formate, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate and ethanol.	1
Strain NL1 was oxidase- and catalase-negative and could not ferment glucose, lactose, xylose, @sm$ maltose @/sm$, and sucrose. In addition, the strain was negative for esculin hydrolysis, H2S production, and sodium citrate utilization but positive in lysine and ornithine tests. Overall, biochemical tube test results were in accordance with the general characteristics of Acinetobacter. strain NL1 was further identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. The partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was a continuous stretch of 1345 bp, which exhibited 99.7% identity and zero branch length compared to the @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ @gm$ JCM 6840 @/gm$ gene (Supplementary Figure 2). Based on these results, strain NL1 was identified as @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ and was preserved in the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC NO: M20191004).	0
Strain SY1027 genome contains glucose-specific IIA component in phosphotransferase system (PTS), endoglucanase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which suggest that the bacteria is capable in breaking down maltose and trehalose, cellulose and @sm$ fructose @/sm$, respectively. The potential of utilizing other sugars besides glucose may partly explain the ubiquitous nature of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ in the environment.	2
Strain TBZ2T grows in the absence of @sm$ NaCl @/sm$ and tolerates up to 8.5% @sm$ NaCl @/sm$. Growth occurred at pH 3.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 6.0-7.0) and 10-45  C (optimum, 30  C). The major fatty acids are C18:1omega7C, C16:1omega7C/ C15:0 iso 2-OH, C16:0, C12:0, C10:0 3-OH, C12:0 3-OH. The major polar lipids include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and the predominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone Q-9. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain TBZ2T is a member of the genus @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ with the highest similarity to P. oleovorans subsp. oleovorans DSM 1045T (98.83%), P. mendocina NBRC 14162T (98.63%), P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis RS1T (98.61%) and P. alcaliphila JCM 10630T (98.49%) based on EzBioCloud server. Phylogenetic analyses using housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, rpoD, gyrB and rpoB) and genome sequences demonstrated that the strain TBZ2T formed a distinct branch closely related to the type strains of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ and P. guguanensis. Digital DNA-DNA hybridisation and average nucleotide identity values between strain TBZ2T and its closest relatives, P. mendocina NBRC 14162T (25.3%, 81.5%) and P. guguanensis JCM 18146T (26.8%, 79.0%), rate well below the designed threshold for assigning prokaryotic strains to the same species. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genomic and phylogenetic results, it is recommended that strain TBZ2T is a novel species of the genus @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$, for which the name Pseudomonas khazarica sp.	4
Strain-level analysis of gene families showed that some genomic regions of @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$ (e.g., ABC-type multidrug transport system), Bacteroides vulgatus (transcriptional regulator), and F. praustnitzii (Class V aminotransferase) were negatively associated with IBS-D, and those of Clostridium comes (e.g., Class II aldolase/adducin family protein) were positively associated with IBS-C (Supplementary Figure S3-6). Many of the proteins containing these domains are part of @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism, including glycogen phosphorylase from Class V aminotransferase and L-fuculose phosphate aldolase from Class II aldolase/adducin family protein that is involved in fucose metabolism.	2
Structurally, it is similar to @sm$ genistein @/sm$, but it lacks a hydroxyl group on the fifth position.. To permit the absorption of daidzein through the gut epithelium, beta-glucosidase cleaves and releases sugar moiety producing the aglycone. The metabolic pathway of daidzein begins with a reduction reaction yielding dihydrodaidzein through the hydrogenation of the activated double bonds, followed by O-desmethylangolensin or S- equol production depending on gut microbes. Gut bacteria involved include the Clostridium-like strain and @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$.	2
Structures are available for butyryl-CoA (Coenzyme A) dehydrogenase (EtfAB-Bcd) from @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, caffeyl-CoA reductase (CarCDE) from Acetobacterium woodii, and Fix/EtfABCX from Thermotoga maritima.- EtfAB-Bcd and CarCDE both reduce high-potential @sm$ CoA @/sm$-derivatives (high-potential acceptors) along with the low-potential acceptor ferredoxin (Fd) via NADH oxidation and possess structures obtained through X-ray crystallography (MX; PDB IDs: 4L2I and 6FAH, respectively), whereas Fix/EtfABCX reduces the high-potential acceptor menaquinone (MQ) along with Fd and whose structure was solved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM; PDB ID: 7KOE).	2
Studies detected a greater prevalence of periodontal pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, as well as a combination of these species in HIV-infected patients compared with non-HIV-infected individuals. AIDS patients present high levels of circulating prostaglandin E2, which appears to suppress the specific antigen response of both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes. There is little information about the role of @sm$ prostaglandins @/sm$ in the etiology of periodontitis in HIV-infected patients.	3
Subsequently, the specimens were sectioned exposing the adhesive interface with a hard tissue microtome (Accuton 50, Struers A/@gm$ S, Ballerup @/gm$, Denmark) and a protocol of demineralization and deproteinization was performed in order to expose the resin tags and remove sectioning debris. Ethanol in ascending concentrations was then used (70%:20 min; 95%:20 min and 100%:30 min, 3x), followed by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) in two immersion periods of 10 min each. After 24 h of air-drying, samples were then fixed with a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ tape and sputter coated with a thin film of gold/palladium on a Q150T ES Turbo-Pumped Sputter coater (Quorum Technologies, Q150T Turbomolecular-pumped coating system, Lewes, UK) with a 15.0 kV electron acceleration beam.	0
Such strains could become effective drugs against inflammatory diseases exemplified by colitis and @sm$ LPS @/sm$-related conditions. In the case of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae infections, bifidobacteria are capable of immune system modulation via induction or suppression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A number of B. pseudocatenulatum strains have been shown to suppress TNF-alpha and IL-6 production while stimulating IL-10 production. Overall, these results corroborate the efficacy of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains as potential solutions for infectious and inflammatory diseases.	3
Sugar and methylation analyses of native @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ together with one-dimensional 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the two @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ from strains 22074 and 12254 of @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ are identical. The structure of the @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ from strain 22074 was deduced from a uronic acid degradation and by NMR spectroscopy where heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments established the pentasaccharide repeating unit as-->4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)-alpha-L- Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->.	1
Supplemental material provides figures depicting flexibility profiles of V-sensors compared with diverse TolQ proteins and sequence similarity of the TolQ-like protein from Aquifex aeolicus VF5 (UniProt ID: O67795) as well as the flagellar motor protein PomA from @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ (UniProt ID: A0A1D8SCS3) with S2 to S4 segments in @sm$ V @/sm$-sensors.	0
Supplementation of M9 minimal medium with glycerol as the sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source and glutamate as the nitrogen source did not support E. coli growth (Fig. 6). The effect of either inosine or guanosine as the supplemental nitrogen sources was examined using the WT and isogenic add and punC deletion mutant strains, measuring growth when glycerol was the @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source. The punC mutant showed a decrease in the growth rate compared to the WT strain under nitrogen starvation conditions when inosine or guanosine was present as an additional nitrogen source (Fig. 6b, c). This suggested that the PunC transporter can take up, in addition to adenosine and 2-deoxyadenosine, inosine and guanosine. Thus, the PunC uptake transporter exhibits broad specificity for purine nucleosides as revealed by these phenotypic analyses. The punC homologue deletion mutant in @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ showed a decrease in the growth fitness in defined medium when adenosine, inosine, 2-deoxyadenosine, 2-deoxyinosine and 2-deoxyadenosine-phosphate were @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources, but not for other 189 experimental conditions including different @sm$ carbon @/sm$ or nitrogen sources (fit.genomics.lbl.gov).	2
Surprisingly, and in contrast to avoidance of @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$, tax-2 but not tax-4 mutation suppressed the avoidance of P. aeruginosa of npr-1(ad609) animals (Figure 4D). The discrepancy between the double mutants is that the tax-2(p694) allele used only affects a subset of the tax-2 expressing neurons. The tax-4(p678) allele, in contrast, affects all tax-4-expressing neurons (Figure 4E). Thus, the neurons affected by the tax-4(p678) allele, but spared by the tax-2(p694) allele, most likely play a role in avoidance of P. aeruginosa independent from the @sm$ oxygen @/sm$-sensing pathway. The results from the @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ experiments, on the other hand, suggest that the tax-2(p694) allele covers additional neurons that regulate avoidance of that bacteria. To confirm this, we used single loss-of-function mutants for tax-2 and tax-4, including a strain carrying an allele that affects expression in all tax-2 expressing neurons (tax-2(p671)). We indeed found that all strains tested displayed decreased avoidance of @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ compared to wild-type animals, while only tax-2(p671) and tax-4(p678) mutants displayed decreased avoidance of P.	3
Surprisingly, the inhibitory effect was not observed in HS or HSF, which exhibited higher Enterobacteriaceae loads than in @sm$ S @/sm$ samples. The data collected on mesophilic aerobes, bacterial spores, and LAB were consistent with those reported by Wynants et al. that reflected a wide variability based on the substrate, the rearing methods and the timing of larval harvest. In frass samples, viable counts were generally higher, probably because of the accumulation effect during the rearing period. Finally, no @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ or Salmonella spp.	0
Sustainably produced H2, CO2, and @sm$ CO @/sm$ can be co-fed to microorganisms as a source for acetyl-CoA, while a small amount of an ATP-generating organic substrate helps overcome the kinetic hindrances associated with autotrophic carboxylate production. Here, we operated two semi-continuous bioreactor systems with continuous recirculation of H2, CO2, and @sm$ CO @/sm$ while co-feeding an organic model feedstock (lactate and acetate) to understand how a mixotrophic community is shaped during carboxylate production. Contrary to the assumption that H2, CO2, and @sm$ CO @/sm$ support chain elongation via ethanol production in open cultures, significant correlations (p < 0.01) indicated that relatives of Clostridium luticellarii and Eubacterium aggregans produced carboxylates (acetate to n-caproate) while consuming H2, CO2, @sm$ CO @/sm$, and lactate themselves. After 100 days, the enriched community was dominated by these two bacteria coexisting in cyclic dynamics shaped by the @sm$ CO @/sm$ partial pressure. Homoacetogenesis was strongest when the acetate concentration was low (3.2 g L-1), while heterotrophs had the following roles: Pseudoramibacter, @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, and Colidextribacter contributed to n-caproate production and Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Acidipropionibacterium spp. grew opportunistically producing n-butyrate and propionate, respectively. The mixotrophic chain elongation community was more efficient in carboxylate production compared with the heterotrophic one and maintained average carbon fixation rates between 0.088 and 1.4 g CO2 equivalents L-1 days-1. The extra H2 and @sm$ CO @/sm$ consumed routed 82% more electrons to carboxylates and 50% more electrons to carboxylates longer than acetate.	2
TCDD decreased the concentrations of 2 @sm$ BAs @/sm$, especially (T)DCA and (T)omegaMCA in liver, bile, and serum. 2 @sm$ BAs @/sm$ are formed in the intestine by the gut microbiota. The 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation of 1 @sm$ BAs @/sm$ is mainly processed by Clostridia. CDCA and MCAs inhibit the germination of @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$. It can be hypothesized that increased biliary excretion of TCDCA and the MCAs into the intestine may inhibit the bacterial 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation activity of Clostridia, and thus contribute to the reduced formation of 2 @sm$ BAs @/sm$.	2
TMAO is generated by the microbial transformation of food components, such as @sm$ carnitine @/sm$, choline or lecithin, and its increased levels has been related with tissue inflammation, impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic dysfunction. Likewise, dietary BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine and valine can also regulate glucose and lipid metabolisms, and altered BCAA levels have been associated with insulin resistance, and enhanced risk for metabolic diseases. Interestingly, different bacteria (i.e., Prevotella copri and B. vulgatus) are potent producers of BCAAs, whereas others (i.e., @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Eubacterium siraeum) are able to take up BCAAs, suggesting that microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic diseases by modulating BCAAs levels.	2
TUMSAT-Msp001 are closely related to homologues in @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$. M. bovis BCG was detected until 7 days post-injection at the injection site (muscle) and 28 days post-vaccination in spleen. Cumulative mortality of amberjack, Seriola dumerili vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) with M. bovis BCG was 32.3% and 59.5% respectively, at 24 days post-infection of Mycobacterium sp., compared to 97.8% in @sm$ PBS @/sm$-injected fish. The bacterial counts of Mycobacterium sp. in spleen of both i.m.-and i.p.-vaccinated fish (6.2 x 103 and 1.3 x 104 CFU/mg tissue, respectively) at 20 days post-infection were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those of @sm$ PBS @/sm$-injected fish (8.0 x 106 CFU/mg).	0
Table 4 shows also the numerical results of the EDA-NOCV calculations of the alkaline earth dicarbonyls M(CO)2 (M = Ca, Sr, @sm$ Ba @/sm$) using neutral and charged fragments as interacting moieties and the experimentally observed [Ba(CO)] +. The dicarbonyls have been calculated as model compounds in order to examine the suggestion that the red-shift of the alkaline earth octacarbonyls M(CO)8 (M = Ca, Sr, @sm$ Ba @/sm$) comes from interligand interaction between neighboring CO ligands rather than from M   (CO)8 pi-backdonation. The trans-relative position in the linear dicarbonyls, which are minima on the potential energy surface, effectively precludes a direct interaction between the CO ligands. The EDA-NOCV data in Table 4 show that the orbital interactions in M(CO)2 are in the same way dominated by M   (CO) pi-backdonation as in the octacarbonyls M(CO)8. This is equally true for the calculations with neutral and charged fragments. Note that the pi-backdonation in the dicarbonyls is distributed over only two CO ligands whereas it covers eight CO ligands in the octacarbonyls. This explains why the red-shift of the C-O stretching frequencies in M(CO)2 is much larger than in M(CO)8 (Table 1). Table 4 shows that the largest contribution to the orbital interactions even in the radical cation [Ba(@gm$ CO)] + comes @/gm$ from Ba+   (CO) pi-backdonation. This has been discussed in detail before. The EDA-NOCV results clearly show that the red-shift in the alkaline earth octacarbonyls M(CO)8 (M = Ca, Sr, @sm$ Ba @/sm$) comes from M   (CO)8 pi-backdonation.	0
Taking deltamethrin and @sm$ lambda-cyhalothrin @/sm$ as research objects, three strains of bacteria capable of effectively degrading two pyrethroid pesticides were obtained by enriching, separating, and purifying the strains in soil samples. These strains were @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ ZK4 (accession number: KJ806387.1), Pseudomonas sp. ZF1, and Enterobacter sp. ZW3. ZK4, as a bacterium with the ability to degrade deltamethrin and @sm$ lambda-cyhalothrin @/sm$, has not been the focus of previous reports.	2
Tatlockia micdadei and Legionella maceachernii contained large amounts of rhamnose, @sm$ fucose @/sm$, and fucosamine but not quinovosamine. These two species were the only legionellae studied that contained another unusual sugar that is referred to as X3, pending determination of its structure. Fluoribacter dumoffi, @gm$ Fluoribacter bozemanae @/gm$, and Legionella anisa were varied in their carbohydrate contents, both within and between species, but could be distinguished from L.	0
Tea saponin is also an important fungicide, composed of sugar chains, triterpenoids, and steroids or steroid alkaloids that are linked by carbon-@sm$ oxygen @/sm$ bonds. The structures of insect gut microbiomes have been significantly changed after feeding on fruits containing tea saponin. The soil microbiomes evaluated here also exhibited similar changes in response to saponin contents. Moreover, the relative abundances of Enterobacter, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Aquabacterium, and Rhodoplanes were associated with the increasing tea saponin accumulation that accrued across plantation ages (Fig. 1e and f). In addition, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ abundance was significantly and positively correlated with tea saponin accumulation (Fig. 1f). This bacterium is frequently associated with both aspen foliage and the gypsy moths that consume aspen foliage tissue, metabolizing phenolic glycosides within the foliage. Further, the species @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$ and A. oleivorans were able to degrade catechin, modulating host physiology and metabolism to improve hexadecane utilization efficiency. @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ derived from wood-fed termite guts can efficiently degrade phenolic compounds by using phenol as its sole carbon source. Community interaction networks and random forest classification analyses conducted in this study indicated that @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ was one of the core soil bacteria in old C. oleifera plantations. The relative abundance of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ was significantly and positively correlated with tea saponin accumulation, firmly suggesting that @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is closely involved in tea saponin degradation.	2
Ten patients were evaluated after taking 250 mg/day of @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ for 2 to 7 years. Ten other patients who had been on @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ for at least 2 years were evaluated 6 months to 2 years after stopping the antibiotic. Subgingival plaque was cultured anaerobically on nonselective media (ETSA) and ETSA with 1 microgram/ml of @sm$ tetracycline HCl @/sm$. Pocket depth, plaque and gingivitis were scored. Those patients on @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ had no bleeding on probing despite residual pockets ranging from 3 to 7 mm. Gram-negative anaerobic rods made up to 49.8% of the microflora of these patients, with Fusobacterium nucleatum dominating. @gm$ B. melaninogenicus @/gm$, and B. gingivalis were not detected in the samples. Five of ten patients off @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ bled on probing and had pocket depths in the same range as those on @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$. The microflora of @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-off sites was predominately Gram-negative rods (63.1% with B. gingivalis and F. nucleatum 7.3% and 3.1% of the flora respectively). In @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-on samples 76.6% of the isolates were resistant to 1 microgram/ml of @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ compared to 25.9% in the patients off @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ and 7.1% resistant organisms in 14 untreated control samples from periodontitis patients not exposed to any long-term @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ therapy. Long-term, low-dose @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ was associated with a healthy clinical condition and diverse Gram-negative anaerobic flora resistant to the antibiotic. After discontinuing @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ the clinical and bacterial status was more characteristic of disease.	4
The 16S rRNA profile-based functional prediction using PICRUSt2 demonstrated @sm$ indole @/sm$-metabolic enzymes such as tryptophanase and indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase were notably elevated in the microbiota exposed to STR ( Figure 6A ). @sm$ Indole @/sm$ metabolites are a pivotal type of URS that accumulates in the blood and tissues during acute or chronic renal diseases through human and microbial tryptophan metabolism. We addressed bacteria with genes encoding URS-producing enzymes in the present bacterial community. Based on sequence alignments of the bacterial genes, ten different species of bacteria were identified as having genes for tryptophanase (TNase) (B. acidifaciens, E. coli, Akkermansia muciniphila, B. uniformis, B. xylanisolvens, @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$, Oscillibacter, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Porphyromonadaceae, and B. faecis), aryl sulfotransferase (Bifidobacterium longum group and Lactobacillus plantarum), and choline TMA-lyase (CutC) (E. coli). In particular, bacterial TNase is the key enzyme for the conversion of tryptophan into @sm$ indole @/sm$ in the gastrointestinal tract, which is then further metabolized into renal toxic indoxyl sulfate (IS) in the liver by the hepatic CYP450 enzyme. Consistent with the microbial genetic features of @sm$ indole @/sm$ metabolism, the blood level of IS was significantly elevated by CDDP treatment in STR-exposed animals whose microbiota showed an elevated composition of B. acidifaciens ( Figure 6B ). On an assumption that B. acidifaciens is a pivotal IS producer in renal injury model, this bacterium was assessed for its ability to convert tryptophan into @sm$ indole @/sm$ in vitro. B. acidifaciens produced @sm$ indole @/sm$ in GAM broth which already includes tryptophan ( Figure 6C ). Although the bacteria displayed Ehrlich's test negative in the minimal media without tryptophan, they produced @sm$ indole @/sm$ in the presence of tryptophan ( Figure 6D ).	1
The 39 @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp. strains isolated from broiler farms were classified as MDR strains that were resistant to the four antibiotic classes of penicillins, aminoglycosides, @sm$ sulfonamides @/sm$, and cephalosporins (AM, GM, STR, SXT, CRO, and CAZ) (Table-2).	4
The 39 @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp. strains isolated from broiler farms were classified as MDR strains that were resistant to the four antibiotic classes of penicillins, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and cephalosporins (AM, GM, STR, SXT, CRO, and @sm$ CAZ @/sm$) (Table-2). Regarding the strains isolated from human subjects with gastroenteritis, the serotype Typhimurium (n=1) was classified as an MDR strain that exhibited resistance to GM, STR, chloramphenicol, and florfenicol. In total, 83.6% (41/49) of the strains were resistant to STR and 79.5% (39/49) were resistant to AM. In the case of cephalosporins, 75.5% (37/49) of the strains were resistant to CRO and @sm$ CAZ @/sm$.	4
The @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ populations from water samples of 9 different fish farming sites across Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal were investigated. Samples were collected in sterilized vials, kept at 4 C, and analyzed within 24 h of procuring. For isolation of the bacteria, 0.1 ml of ten-fold diluted samples prepared in sterile distilled water was spread plated on @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ isolation medium (HiMedia Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 C in the bacterial incubator. Altogether, 83 single colonies were selected based on the expected morphology from the spread plates, and pure cultures were maintained by streaking them on tryptone soya agar slants. Glycerol stocks of cultures were maintained in 10% glycerol at -20 C. All of the isolates were initially screened presumptively using a slightly modified key test called Aerokey II, described by Carnahan et al., to identify the genus @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$. The isolates were tested for Gram-staining, oxidase, catalase, glucose fermentation, resistance to 0/129 discs, and @sm$ esculin @/sm$ hydrolysis. The strains were labeled as presumptive @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp.	2
The @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains were able to utilise three purine and two pyrimidine nucleosides tested as a sole carbon source (Additional file 3). The enzymes suggested to complete a metabolic link between @sm$ nucleoside @/sm$ and central metabolism in B. hyodysenteriae WA1 were identified in the @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains.	2
The @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ isolate was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (@gm$ ATCC  6919 @/gm$ ). The strain was streaked from freezer stock onto Tryptic soy agar plates (TSA) supplemented with 5% sheep blood (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 37 C for 72 h prior to making liquid cultures in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) supplemented with 1% @sm$ dextrose @/sm$ (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) (additional 72 h incubation) for use in the below described assays.	2
The @sm$ G + C @/sm$ content of Massilioclostridium coli is smaller than that of Flavonifractor plautii, Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus, Oscillibacter valericigenes, Ruminococcus albus, Oscillibacter ruminantium, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$ (39.97, 61.07, 59.11, 53.19, 43.62, 54.97, 59.06 and 55.56% respectively).	0
The @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ profile of the strain differed with other species of the genus Megasphaera as it displayed presence of C20:1 omega7c, C18:3 omega6c and C17:1 is oomega5c as major @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$. Polar lipid analysis of strain DISK18 revealed amino phospholipids as the major lipids and presence of unknown lipids were also observed (Supplementary Figure S1). Further, phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DISK18 showed high identity with @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T (99.73%), however, this species was found to be an invalid species of the genus Megasphaera and not included in list of prokaryotic standing nomenclature. The next phylogenetic close relative was M. indica NMBHI10T with an identity of 96.62%. Similarly, the rpoB gene sequence analysis of strain DISK18 also displayed high identity with M. massiliensis @gm$ DSM 26228 @/gm$T. Consequently, strain DISK18 formed a coherent cluster with closely related species including M. massiliensis @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T, M. indica NMBHI10T and M. elsdenii LC1T with significant bootstrap value and shared a clade with M. massiliensis @gm$ NP3 @/gm$T in neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using 16S rRNA (Fig.	0
The @sm$ flavonol @/sm$, quercetin and the flavonone, luteolin get degraded by @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, to give 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4HPAA) (phenolic acid) and 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (cinnamic acid derivative), respectively.	2
The @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ (Table 1) for the assembly of the wild-type (wt) and the T46A-mutated 5'-UTR from the @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ prfA gene were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt/M., Germany) in a reaction containing 150 pmol of each @sm$ oligonucleotide @/sm$, 1 mM ATP and 10 U polynucleotide kinase. For annealing of the complementary @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$, 75 pmol of each phosphorylated @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ were mixed, incubated at 95 C and slowly cooled down to 35 C. For cloning, vector pBS SK(+) was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated to the annealed double-stranded @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ resulting in plasmids pBS41 (wt prfA 5'-UTR) and pBS42 (T46A mutant version; 4).	0
The @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ requirements of the isolation host for each phage also appear to influence the RNR class present, consistent with the observation that class I RNR is aerobic, class II is @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ independent, and class III is anaerobic. Regardless of isolation environment or phage family, phages infecting aerobes contain primarily class I or class II RNR genes (Figure 2). Most of the phages that infect facultative anaerobes contain class I+III genes, and all three phages that contain only class III RNR genes are known to infect strict anaerobes (@gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ spp.). In bacteria, the class II nrdJ gene can enable DNA replication and repair under @sm$ oxygen @/sm$-limiting conditions, potentially explaining the presence of class II RNR in some phages infecting facultative aerobes and facultative anaerobes. The class II+III combination was completely absent amongst the 685 phage genomes analyzed, suggesting that the combination of class I+II or class I+III is more advantageous for infection under fluctuating @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ conditions.	3
The @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA gene of @sm$ quinolone @/sm$-resistant @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ isolates were sequenced. Four types of point mutation, Ser-83-to-Phe (TCC --> TTc), Ser-83-to-Tyr (TCC --> TAC), Asp-87-to-Gly (GAC --> GGC), and Asp-87-to-Asn (GAC --> AAC), were found. PCR-RFLP and MAS-touch down PCR were performed on fifty swine clinical isolates of @gm$ S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ (NalR) collected during 1997-2002. The analysis indicated seven isolates with point mutations in codon 83, 13 with point mutations in codon 87, and 30 with double mutations in both codons 83 and 87. The MICs of enrofloxacin of the isolates with a single mutation in codon 83 or 87 were <2microg/ml, while the MICs of the isolates with double mutations in both codon 83 and 87 ranged from 2 to 64microg/ml. A class I integron comprised of dhfr, orfF and aad2 was also identified in both human and swine @gm$ S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ isolates. These results indicate that PCR-RFLP and MAS-touchdown PCR assays can be used for surveillance of gyrA gene mutations, which are important for fluoroquinolone resistance in @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$. Isolates with double mutations in gyrA codons 83 and 87 are the major type of @sm$ quinolone @/sm$-resistant @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolated from swine in Taiwan. A surveillance system may be applied to the swine industry to monitor the emergence of fluoroquinolone and/or multi-drug-resistant @gm$ S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ in Taiwan.	4
The @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ (monoterpenoids) alpha-terpineol (24) is also found in A. feddei and A. princeps Pamp with a very low to very high activity against 20 pathogenic bacteria with a MIC value of 30 to 3200 microg/mL. Likewise, borneol (31&32), commonly present in A. feddei, A. indica, A. argyi, and A. iwayomogi, showed a MIC value of 2 to 12,800 microg/mL against 44 zoonotic bacteria such as S. aureus, S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$, V. vulnificus, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, S. pyogenes, E. coli, S. sobrinus, S. epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans, S. anginosus, S. gordonii, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, S. sanguinis, S. ratti, S. criceti, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, and S. dyssenteriae. Using a bioactivity-directed fractionation and isolation strategy, beta-caryophyllene (12) was identified and this compound inhibited 36 pathogenic and clinical bacteria, particularly S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. gallinarum, H. influenzae, K. pneumonia, MRSA, methicillin and gentamycin-resistant S. aureus (MGRSA), etc. with a MIC value ranging from 25 to over 12,800 microg/mL. Furthermore, it is possible that most @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ have greater anti-bacterial activity than @sm$ terpenes @/sm$. The MIC value of one @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ (monoterpenoids), camphor (33), and one triterpenoid, ursolic acid (49), towards different bacteria was 2 to 1280 microg/mL and 32 to 1280 microg/mL, respectively. Accordingly, a @sm$ terpenoids @/sm$ (sesquiterpenoids), artemisinin (44) (MIC = 90 microg/mL), had a higher activity than a monoterpenoid, linalool (19) (MIC 250 microg/mL) against @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$, E.	3
The Ae24 pili were electrophoretically distinguishable from previously reported Aeromonas hydrophila Ae6 W pili and @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ Ae1 pili, although all three had indistinguishable morphology and shared a high degree of homology in the N-terminal amino acid sequences. Strain Ae24 and its purified pili adhered to rabbit intestine and agglutinated human and rabbit erythrocytes. Hemagglutination was inhibited by D-galactose and D-mannose, but not by @sm$ L-fucose @/sm$.	0
The CariesRisk Test (CRT) buffer was used to assess buffer capacity of saliva, while CRT bacteria were used todetermine the presence of @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ and Lactobacillus spp. Statistically significant between-groupdifferences were found for the intake of collard greens and beets (p<0.05), but not for othervegetables. As for drink consumption, patients with pigmentation reported less wine intake (p<0.05)than those without pigmentation. There was no difference according to drug intake between patientswith and without pigmentation. Patients with pigmentation were older, smoked and had lower salivapH with lower presence of @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ than those without pigmentation (p<0.05). In toothdiscoloration samples, there were traces of calcium, @sm$ magnesium @/sm$, iron, copper and zinc.	0
The Cronobacter strains resistance to @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$ and streptomycin have also been isolated from various foods in Korea and commercial PIF in China (Lee et al.,). Caubilla-Barron and co-workers reported that the @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ strains isolated from two fatal neonatal infections expressed beta-lactamase activity (Caubilla-Barron et al.,).	4
The ESI-MS/MS data revealed the presence of six bioactive compounds: phthalic acid, myristic acid, Mangiferin, 16-hydroxylpalmatic acid, @sm$ apigenin @/sm$ and oleandomycin, in fraction 23 (Fig 4 & S1-S4 Figs in S1 File). This technique has previously been used for the identification of such compounds. Phthalic acid identified from Nonomuraea species showed potent antibacterial potential against Micrococcus luteus, B. substilis, S. epidermis, S. aureus, MRSA S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi-B.	3
The ESX-5 system is the other well studied T7SS, mostly in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$. EsxN and EsxM are cognate substrates of the ESX-5. In addition, the PE/PPE family proteins are also substrates of ESX-5. These proteins are named after the proline-@sm$ glutamate @/sm$ (PE) and proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) motifs at their N-terminal homology domain, respectively. The C-terminal domain varies extensively in sequence and length. Although nonpathogenic mycobacteria only contain a few pe/ppe genes, these gene families are greatly expanded in the genome of M. tb (169 pe/ppe genes) and @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ (281 pe/ppe genes).	0
The EVs of @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ strain 6571 and L. rhamnosus JB-1 contain PGN and LTA, respectively, which are derived from the respective bacterial cell walls. PGA and LTA in these EVs are presumably involved in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via TLR2. On the other hand, cell wall-derived LTA and PGN components were not detected in L. plantarum EVs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). NF-kappaB was not activated via NLR1 or 2, which recognize iE-DAP and @sm$ MDP @/sm$, respectively, derived from PGN.	1
The GPx activity of all samples was stable from 0 to 2 d of storage regardless of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ inoculation status and @sm$ ozone @/sm$ exposure. On 3 d of storage, a significant decrease (p<0.05) in GPx activity occurred in all treatments. There was no significant (p>0.05) effect of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ inoculation and @sm$ ozone @/sm$ on the activity of the GPx enzyme from 0 to 2 d of storage. On the last day of storage, @sm$ ozone @/sm$ exposure significantly decreased the GPx activity regardless of the @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ inoculation status. These results indicate that GPx was more resistant to @sm$ ozone @/sm$ than CAT. This result is in accordance with that of. CAT and GPx, together with superoxide dismutase (SOD), are known to act to prevent the accumulation of lipid oxidation products. As the activity of CAT and GPx was reduced by @sm$ ozone @/sm$, these enzymes lost their abilities, which resulted in increased lipid oxidation rates. This outcome can be an additional explanation for the higher TBARS values found in samples under @sm$ ozone @/sm$ exposure (Table 3).	3
The GmpC protein from @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ binds specifically to the dipeptide glycylmethionine, yet is related in sequence to the E. coli methionine-binding protein, MetQ. Although this is an interesting case, it is unlikely that the cluster F SBPs would accommodate larger peptides like the cluster C SBPs. The flexibility of the cluster C SBPs that allows them to bind large ligands has also been demonstrated recently by the discovery of SBPs from this cluster that are @sm$ oligosaccharide @/sm$-binding proteins.	0
The Gram-positive, thermophilic @gm$ Bacillus methanolicus @/gm$ can utilize methanol as its sole carbon and energy source, supporting fast growth at its optimal temperature of 50 C. The wild-type (WT) strain B. methanolicus MGA3 is able to overproduce 59 g/L of L-glutamate, and it has been engineered for methanol-based production of 65 g/L of L-lysine. Introduction of genes coding for L-glutamate decarboxylase and L-lysine decarboxylase converted this strain to produce 11.3 g/L of cadaverine and 9 g/L of GABA, respectively, in fed-batch fermentations from methanol. Methanol-based production of @sm$ acetoin @/sm$ was achieved by heterologous expression of genes for two decarboxylating enzymes, acetolactate synthase, and acetolactate decarboxylase. Biochemical, genetic, and omics analyses provided a sound basis for the biochemical and genetic understanding of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$, and metabolic fluxes during growth with methanol, mannitol, and arabitol have been unraveled. However, an insight into the response of this bacterium to non-native chemical compounds, such as cadaverine, GABA, and @sm$ acetoin @/sm$ that were synthesized upon introduction of non-native enzymes, typically does not exist. Since @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ is used for the methanol-based production of proteins, amino acids, and derived chemicals, the response of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ to the non-native L-lysine-derived omega-amino acid 5AVA has been studied.	1
The IF1-P group had a significant increase in abundance of Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis and Eubacterium fissicatena group (q <= 0.007), while the IF2-P group had a significant increase in abundance of Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis and a decrease in @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ group (q <= 0.005). The plasma metabolite profile of IF2-P participants displayed significant increases in serine, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), levulinic acid, 3-aminobutyric acid, citrate, isocitrate, and @sm$ glucuronic acid @/sm$ (q <= 0.049) compared to IF1-P.	0
The L-fucose permease-encoding gene fucP and the surrounding coding region (CFT03427_1042-1047) was present in all @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ strains examined, but was absent from its closest relatives C. iguaniorum and C. hyointestinalis. Low homology orthologs (57-65% identity) were identified in C. coli and C. jejuni by an online BLASTP search against the nonredundant database. In some C. jejuni strains, fucP and the surrounding coding region (cj0480c-cj0490) are implicated in the uptake of the sugar @sm$ L-fucose @/sm$, which is released from the host's mucin glycoproteins and has been shown to be important in colonizing hosts. Noteworthy, fucP and the surrounding coding region were present in C. coli showing introgression by C. jejuni genes, suggesting that the presence of this region provides C. coli an advantage in the gastrointestinal tract. Fermentation of carbohydrates is considered uncommon in Campylobacter, which might be related to the absence of 6-phosphofructokinase needed for glycolysis and key enzymes in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. However, the presence of fucP and the surrounding coding region in @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ predicts that, besides amino acids and organic acids, @sm$ L-fucose @/sm$ can be metabolized by @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$.	2
The LPS was isolated from enzymatically digested cells of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ AH-3DeltawecP + pBAD-WecA-WzyEEc grown under arabinose inducing conditions (+ arabinose) by phenol/water extraction and purified by ultracentrifugation as indicated in Materials and Methods. After mild acid degradation and GPC fractionation on Sephadex G-50, the high-molecular-mass @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ PS @/sm$) was obtained (Fig 3). Sugar analysis of the @sm$ PS @/sm$ revealed the presence of 6-deoxy-L-talose (L-6dTal) and D-mannose in the ratios 2.1:1, as well as N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-galactose) which are characteristic of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ O34-antigen LPS (Fig 4).	1
The MIC of @sm$ PCA @/sm$ against M. luteus was 1.25 mg/mL. @sm$ PCA @/sm$ as a natural extract was found with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. For instance, the MIC of @sm$ PCA @/sm$ against Yersinia enterocolitica was 0.3125 mg/mL, the MIC against C. sakazakii was 1.25 mg/mL, and the MIC against S. aureus, @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ and E. coli was measured as 0.9, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/mL, respectively. The results of this experiment suggested that @sm$ PCA @/sm$ also exhibited high antibacterial activity against M.	3
"The O-PS, a key virulence factor in smooth @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp., remains the most studied component of this pathogen's LPS (; Figure 1). The lack of O-PS is what differentiates the LPS of @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ and B. ovis from their smooth counterparts. In other Gram-negative bacteria, the O-PS typically exhibits a high degree of variability, allowing for strain differentiation by molecular methods. In contrast, @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ O-PS is highly homogeneous, possibly due to its niche within the intracellular environment limiting horizontal transfer with other bacteria, as suggested by. The @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ O-PS is composed of homopolymers of N-formylperosamine with minor variations depending on strain, in which ""A-dominant"" strains exhibit a linear alpha-1,2-linked polymer with approximately 2% alpha-1,3 linkages while the O-PS from ""M-dominant"" strains is a linear polymer of tetrasaccharide repeating units containing one alpha-1,3 linkage and three alpha-1,2-linked monosaccharide residues. Although not sufficient for speciation, serotyping using monoclonal antibodies directed against A or M epitopes can allow for distinction of different biovars within a particular smooth @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species. Further discussion of O-PS in this review will focus on the classical smooth @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp. (B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis). Although more recently identified @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species have been characterized as smooth (B. neotomae, B. ceti, B. pinnipedialis, B. microti, B. papionis, and B. inopinata), the complete structure of their LPS, including the O-PS, remains to be elucidated. Preliminary work has suggested that some of these strains not only lack typical O-PS epitopes but also suspected alterations to the core and/or @sm$ lipid A @/sm$, possibly accounting for a lack of zoonotic potential in the majority of these species."	0
The PHA monomer compositions were @sm$ 3HB @/sm$ (@sm$ 3-hydroxybutyrate @/sm$), a short-chain-length-PHA, and the medium-chain-length-PHA e.g. 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 3-hydroxydecanoate. Both the phbC and phaC genes were characterized. The phbC enzyme had not been previously detected in a @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ species. A 2.15 g/L of an exopolysaccharide, alginate, was also produced with a similar composition to that of other @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species.	1
The abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed a significant and negative association with a cluster of clinical parameters including 1-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level in OGTT (correlation coefficient -0.39), 2-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level in OGTT (correlation coefficient -0.38), pre-pregnancy BMI (correlation coefficient -0.23), and Hb1Ac (correlation coefficient -0.21). The relative abundance of one Oscillibacter unclassified species was positively correlated with 1-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level in OGTT (correlation coefficient 0.47), 2-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level in OGTT (correlation coefficient 0.37), blood neutrophil count (correlation coefficient 0.43), and neutrophil percentage (correlation coefficient 0.31). Besides, Bacteroides finegoldii and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron showed a positive correlation with blood lymphocyte percentage (correlation coefficient 0.23 and 0.31, respectively) but a negative correlation with neutrophil percentage (correlation coefficient -0.25 and -0.30, respectively). Eubacterium rectale had a positive correlation with HOMA-IR (correlation coefficient 0.30) (Figure 5a). Correlation analysis between gut microbiota and circulating metabolites revealed a significantly negative correlation for the abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ with circulating 2-HB (correlation coefficient -0.37) and a positive correlation for the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii with circulating allantoin (correlation coefficient 0.49). Correlation analysis between metabolites and clinical phenotypes further demonstrated that blood 2-HB level was positively correlated with 2-hour blood @sm$ glucose @/sm$ value (correlation coefficient 0.60) after high @sm$ glucose @/sm$ administration in OGTT.	2
The abundance of several OTUs was nevertheless associated with the levels of serum insulin, HOMA-IR and @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ (Figure 2B and Online Supplementary Table 7). OTU 4438983 belonging to the Archaeon @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ showed the strongest significant negative correlations with these surrogates of insulin-resistance.	0
The acid resistance of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ cells was determined by subjecting them to simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH = 3.5). The SGF consisted of 8.3 g/L proteose-peptone, 2.05 g/L NaCl, 0.6 g/L KH2PO4, 0.11 g/L @sm$ CaCl2 @/sm$, 0.37 g/L KCl, 0.05 g/L oxgall, 1 g/L lysozyme, and 13.3 mg/L of pepsin.	3
The activities of DZNR and DHDR were detected in purified enzymes of @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$ as shown in Fig. 3. During incubation for 15 min, 80% of @sm$ DZN @/sm$ was converted to DHD by 5 microg DZNR in the presence of NADPH under anaerobic condition, while no detectable conversion was observed with NADH.	1
The activities of eight quinolones (ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, A-80556, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin) and three macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin and @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$) against 98 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 120 isolates of five different atypical mycobacterial species including 20 Mycobacterium kansasii, 25 @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$, 25 Mycobacterium avium/intracellulare, 25 Mycobacterium chelonae and 25 Mycobacterium fortuitum were determined with the Middlebrook 7H9 broth macrodilution method. Sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were active against M. tuberculosis (MIC90 0.06-0.5 mg/L; MBC90 0.125-2.0 mg/L). However, higher MIC90S and MBC90S of these quinolones were obtained for strains of multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis. The macrolides tested had poor activity against M. tuberculosis isolates (MIC90 > 8.0 mg/L). Furthermore, high MIC90S of the quinolones and macrolides (2.0 to 8.0 mg/L) were obtained for clinical isolates of atypical mycobacteria, with the exception of clarithromycin against M. kansasii (MIC90 = 1.0 mg/L) and sparfloxacin against @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ (MIC90 = 1.0 mg/L).	3
The activities of protease, pectinase, carboxymethyl-cellulase and xylanase responded linearly (p < 0.05), but alpha-amylase and cellobiose were unaltered with increasing @sm$ RF @/sm$ supplementation (Table 5). The protease, pectinase, and carboxymethyl-cellulase activity values were higher (p < 0.05) for MRF compared to the control. The xylanase activity was greater (p = 0.038) for MRF and HRF than for the control. The numbers of dominant cellulolytic and amylolytic bacteria, total bacteria, fungi, and protozoa linearly increased (p < 0.05), but the methanogens population was unchanged with @sm$ RF @/sm$ supply. The numbers of total bacteria, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, F. succinogenes, Rb. amylophilus and @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ were greater (p < 0.05) in lambs receiving 30 mg/kg DM @sm$ RF @/sm$ than in lambs receiving the control diet.	2
The acute formation of abscesses and osteomyelitis in this case is particularly interesting as @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ is known to be a minimally-aggressive slow-growing organism. Furthermore, our patient had no predisposing factor for systemic disease, including no evidence of @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ or drug dependence, immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, or diabetes mellitus; however, as spinal trauma is a known risk factor for vertebral infections, our patient's acutely herniated intervertebral disc may have contributed to the adjacent development of his abscess and osteomyelitis.	0
The addition of catalase or other @sm$ ROS @/sm$ scavengers, such as sodium pyruvate, to the culture medium improves the culturability of VBNC cultures of A. hydrophila (Wai et al.,), E. coli (Mizunoe et al.,), and @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ (Bogosian et al.,).	3
The addition of soluble starch had no significant effect on the morphological particle size of the @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$-embedded spheres (p > 0.5, Figure 4b). The beads' size enlarged as the concentration of sodium alginate in 0.05 M @sm$ calcium chloride @/sm$ solution increased. The augmented alginate concentration led to higher viscosity, resulting in larger microspheres and greater entrapment of bacteria, thus causing a high degree of cross-linking. Moreover, @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ showed high activity at the experimental sodium alginate concentrations of 3%, 4%, and 5% (Figure 4c).	3
The adhesive property of LAB strains was evaluated by cell surface hydrophobicity using n-hexadecane, toluene, and @sm$ xylene @/sm$. As shown in Figure 3, these strains exhibited high adhesion rates in which the hydrophobicity of @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ strains was 57.34-71.46% with n-hexadecane, 58.89-70.76% with toluene, and lastly 37.52-65.31% with @sm$ xylene @/sm$, respectively.	3
The administration of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp to mice for 8 weeks resulted in higher concentration of ARA and @sm$ DHA @/sm$ in their brains.	1
The administration of @sm$ indomethacin @/sm$ to rats, at the dose of 10 mg/kg once daily for three days, caused a loss of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 in the liver, and a fall in drug-metabolizing enzyme activities (i.e. aminopyrine N-demethylase, NADP cyt. c. reductase). @sm$ Indomethacin @/sm$ also induced intestinal lesions and a significant increase in @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ enterotoxin levels in the feces at 24 hours after both the second and third day of treatment. The above findings suggest that the development of intestinal lesion and the accompanying release of @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ enterotoxin, as well as hepatic enzyme alterations in the rat, result from @sm$ indomethacin @/sm$ administration.	3
The aim of the current study was to inhibit @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ biofilm formation, as assessed using crystal violet staining and FITC-ConA fluorescence microscopy. @sm$ VCM @/sm$ was used as positive control.	3
The aim of the current study was to investigate the biological function of the MCRA-encoding gene of @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ in the hydration of @sm$ oleic acid @/sm$ into 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and its possible role in CLA production.	1
The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of a Cu/@sm$ CaOH2 @/sm$-based endodontic paste, against bacteria and fungi, such as @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.	3
The aim of this work was the development of an immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) method based on the use of beads coated with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) of @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ for the rapid and efficient isolation of @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ from milk samples.	0
The aims of this work were therefore to study the growth potential of @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ @gm$ FR/62/B/3 @/gm$ compared to B. bifidum BBA1 in culture media supplemented with whey or 3'SL and to evaluate the effects of CFSM on virulence expression of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Because of its bovine origin, the hypothesis is that @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ @gm$ FR/62/B/3 @/gm$ can metabolize components present in whey, especially BMO, as explained previously. B. bifidum BBA1, a strain isolated from breastfed children feces, was chosen to provide a comparison with a strain of human origin as this strain should be able to use BMO or 3'SL as a source of carbon, due to their similarity with HMO (Zivkovic and Barile,). Tanimomo et al. developed a culture medium answering to the specificities of @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ @gm$ FR/62/B/3 @/gm$. This formula, more suited to bifidobacteria from bovine origin, was used in this study as an optimized medium in which different sources of @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ have been tested.	2
The alpha-galactosidase selection marker was used to replace the chloramphenicol resistance gene initially contained in the pRAF301 plasmid by using the alpha-galactosidase gene (aga) isolated from @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ ATCC 43,920 strain. It was also transferred into S. thermophilus, and after incubation at 37  C in medium with melibiose and @sm$ raffinose @/sm$ as the main carbon source, the transformants were screened as effectively as chloramphenicol resistance markers.	2
The amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence revealed two @sm$ heme @/sm$-binding sequences, Cys-X-X-Cys-His (diheme cytochrome c). The amino acid sequence of cytochrome c-551 exhibited similarity with that of @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ cytochrome c 4 (gene accession number in Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ:ABP82931; 98.0% identity).	0
The amino acids liberated from bile salt deconjugation could potentially be used as carbon, nitrogen, and energy sources, since glycine may be metabolized to ammonia and carbon dioxide, and @sm$ taurine @/sm$ may be metabolized to ammonia, carbon dioxide, and sulfate. Bile salt deconjugation may therefore confer a nutritional advantage on hydrolytic strains. In support of this hypothesis, Huijghebaert et al. and Van Eldere et al. observed that certain BSH-positive strains of @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ utilized the released @sm$ taurine @/sm$ as an electron acceptor, and growth rates were improved in the presence of @sm$ taurine @/sm$ and @sm$ taurine @/sm$-conjugated bile salts.	2
The analyzed strains demonstrated a mosaic distribution of the predicted @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/AOS utilization phenotypes, and even phylogenetically closely related strains might significantly differ in their utilization capabilities (Supplementary Table S3). The most extreme examples were B. longum subsp. longum and subsp. infantis. The strain ATCC 15697 (B. longum subsp. infantis) lacks the araBDA genes, and is thus not expected to utilize any form of @sm$ arabinose @/sm$. In contrast, the NCC2705 and NCIMB8809 strains (B. longum subsp. longum) contain the largest number of genes associated with @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/AOS utilization, and are thus assigned the U123 phenotype. In several cases, the related strains were assigned the same phenotype (e.g., U2), yet were shown to possess different alpha-AOS utilization regulons (e.g., AauU2 in @gm$ B. stellenboschense @/gm$ and AauR in B.	2
The ankB mutant of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ is severely defective in intracellular proliferation in amoebae and human macrophages due to the defect in assembly of K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins decorating the LCV (Fig. 1). Due to lack of proteasomal degradation of K48-linked polyubiquitin during infection by the ankB mutant, cellular levels of amino acid do not increase. This triggers a bacterial starvation response, mediated by the induced expression of RelA and SpoT, and results in elevated ppGpp levels. Intracellular growth can be restored to the ankB mutant within amoebae and human cells by supplementing excess amino acids. Thus, higher levels of cellular amino acids are needed for intracellular replication of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$. Remarkably, supplementation of infected cells with certain single amino acids, such as @sm$ cysteine @/sm$, reverses the growth defect of the ankB mutant in amoebae and human cells. Interestingly, in human cells @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ is semi-essential and is the least abundant amino acid, but in amoebae @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ is essential. Similar to @sm$ cysteine @/sm$, supplementation of infected cells with pyruvate or citrate to feed the TCA cycle, rescues the ankB mutant for intracellular proliferation. Interestingly, in vitro growth of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ in rich medium requires supplementation with 3.3 mM @sm$ cysteine @/sm$. Therefore, AnkB is a remarkable example of an effector involved in exploitation of multiple host processes that are highly conserved in unicellular eukaryotes and mammals. By promoting proteasomal degradation in amoebae and human cells though the AnkB F-box effector, @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ generates a gratuitous supply of cellular amino acids (Fig. 2), particularly the limiting ones such as @sm$ Cys @/sm$, which is a metabolically favorable source of carbon and energy for @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ to power intracellular growth within amoebae and human cells.	2
The anti-microbial effect of @sm$ endocannabinoids @/sm$ depends on the strain studied and the @sm$ endocannabinoid @/sm$ used (Table 2). Among the tested organisms, @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis were the most susceptible bacteria to AEA and N-Linoleoylethanolamine (LEA).	3
The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine, vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, @sm$ methotrexate @/sm$, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.	3
The antibacterial effect of the lactoperoxidase/thiocyanate/hydrogen peroxide system (lactoperoxidase system) was tested against strains of Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ isolated from poultry. The effect was studied at different pH-values and temperatures in UHT-milk (control); UHT-milk containing lactoperoxidase, @sm$ sodiumthiocyanate @/sm$ and hydrogen peroxide (lactoperoxidase system); UHT-milk containing lactoperoxidase, @sm$ sodiumthiocyanate @/sm$, hydrogen peroxide and sodiumpyrosulfite (inactivated lactoperoxidase system). The lactoperoxidase system had a strong bactericidal effect against C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$.	3
The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt @sm$ L- @/sm$Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$ and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method.	3
The antibiotic (erythromycin, chloramphenicol, @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$, ampicillin, clindamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin) and biocide (peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, and benzalkonium chloride) resistance of clinically relevant bacteria was determined as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Macrococcus caseolyticus, Bacillus sp., Kocuria varians, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter pasteurii, Klebsiella oxytoca, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter sichuanensis, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica.	3
The antibody response specific to the 25-kDa major outer-membrane protein (Omp25) of @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ expressed in Escherichia coli was assessed in BALB/c mice. Groups of mice were immunised and boosted either with sonicated E. coli carrying plasmid pAC2533-E. coli (pAC2533)-expressing the gene coding for Omp25 (omp25 gene) of @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$, or with E. coli carrying plasmid pUC19-E. coli (pUC19). One control group received saline. The evolution of antibody responses was investigated by indirect ELISA with whole rough (R) B. melitensis H38 cells as antigen. Serum antibody titres of mice immunised with E. coli (pAC2533) were appreciably higher than those of mice immunised with E. coli (pUC19). The specificity to Omp25 of murine antibodies induced by E. coli (pAC2533) was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of five @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ strains. Binding of antibody in E. coli (pAC2533) immune sera to the surface of @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ strains differing in their smooth @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (S-LPS) expression was also studied by whole-cell ELISA and by flow cytometry. Antibody reactivity to R and smooth-rough (S-R) was much stronger than that to smooth (S) @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ strains, indicating a much better accessibility of Omp25 to antibody on strains lacking or expressing less O-polysaccharide on their surface. The antibodies to Omp25 were predominantly of IgG2a isotype. The capacity of E. coli (pAC2533) to induce protective immune responses against four challenge strains of @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ was further evaluated in mice. Significant reductions in splenic infections, in comparison with mice immunised with E. coli (pUC19) and unimmunised (saline injection) mice, were observed in R B. melitensis B115, S-R B. melitensis EP and S B. melitensis H38 infected mice. Protection against S @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ 16M was not significant.	0
The antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme, sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (Escherichia coli, @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi A @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus). The major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, @sm$ linalool @/sm$ and linalyl acetate.	3
The antimicrobial potential of the compound was estimated on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter jejuni, @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria strains. Yamogenin showed the strongest cytotoxic effect on AGS cells (IC50 18.50 +- 1.24 microg/mL) among the tested cell lines. This effect was significantly stronger in combinations of yamogenin with oxaliplatin or @sm$ capecitabine @/sm$ than for the single compounds.	3
The antioxidative properties of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains have been demonstrated in different animal models. L. plantarum KSFY02 and B. animalis RH demonstrated AO properties in aged mice. Both strains were found to increase the activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX in this model. The strain L. brevis MG000874 was tested on a murine model of @sm$ D-galactose @/sm$-induced OS.	2
The bacteria most frequently involved in joint prosthesis infections are Staphylococcus aureus oxacillin-resistant (ORSA), methicillin-resistant negative coagulase staphylococci such as oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ORSE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hominis, @sm$ vancocin @/sm$ resistant enterococci (VRE) such as Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multi-resistant @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$.	4
The bacterial @sm$ prodigiosin @/sm$ extracted from strain HDZK-BYSB107 had the antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$, with inhibition zone diameters of 24.02 +- 0.18, 22.74 +- 0.21, 18.32 +- 0.30, 14.52 +- 0.05 and 10.10 +- 0.17 mm, respectively, when 0.1 mg of extract was applied. As shown in Figure 3A, the strongest inhibition was seen against S. aureus, and the weakest was against @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$.	3
The bacterial community in fermented buttermilk makes the final product nutritionally improved and safer to consume due to the production of bioactive compounds such as short chain fatty acids (Butyric acid, @sm$ Lactic acid @/sm$ and Propionic acid), amino acids (Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine and Tryptophan), vitamins (Vitamin B1, B6, and B12), enzymes like lipase, lactase and beta-galactosidase. The fermented buttermilk product also known as cultured milk product which a group of probiotic bacterial members ferments belong to the genera of Lactococcus Lactis, @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.	1
The bacterial production of lactate from @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ involved the catalysis of stereospecific lactate dehydrogenase. The genome of B. thetaiotaomicron encoded only for a d-lactate dehydrogenase (BT_1575), leading to d-lactate production. The lactate-utilizing butyrate-producing bacteria (LUB) could subsequently convert acetate and lactate into butyrate. Our model organism, @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$, was reported to metabolize both d- and l-lactate. Despite the phenotypic observation, @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ possessed two l-lactate dehydrogenases (ANACAC_01148 and ANACAC_03769) while no d-lactate dehydrogenase or lactate racemase were found in the genome. The homologous protein check against d-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus helveticus (UniProt identifier P30901) showed no match in the @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ genome except the general NAD-binding domain. Besides, no domain matching the lactate racemase from Lactobacillus plantarum (UniProt identifier F9USS9) was found in the @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ genome.	2
The bacterial strains EM56 and EM09 were isolated from the rhizosphere of Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke (State of Para, Amazon region, Brazil) and identified by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene as Enterobacter asburiae strain EM56 and @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ strain EM09. These microorganisms were used in this study because of their potential for @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ fixation, phosphate solubilization and plant-growth promotion.	1
The bacterial strains used in this study were @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC25586 @/gm$ (@gm$ FN @/gm$), Actinomyces naeslundii X600 (AN) and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 903 (SM). These bacterial strains were cultured anaerobically in BHIS broth using the AnaeroPack System (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.). BHIS broth is Brain Heart Infusion medium (Eiken Chemical Co.) supplemented with 5 microg/ml hemin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% yeast extract (Becton Dickinson and Company) and 0.375% @sm$ D-glucose @/sm$ (Nacalai Tesque).	2
The basis for there being differences in attachment with different @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains is not known. All four strains were actively motile, were at a similar passage number, and were used at the same multiplicity of infection. Differences amongst the strains in their specific surface proteins and/or @sm$ glycans @/sm$ that may interact with receptors on the Caco-2 cell surface could help to account for their different ability to attach. Strains of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ also have been shown to vary in their attraction to mucin in vitro, and it was of interest that strain Cof-10 that did not attach in the current study also was not attracted to mucin.	0
The bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase (EC 1.17.98.1) that carries out the removal of the 7alpha-hydroxy group from primary bile acids, encoded mainly by @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, was enriched in participants with low MedDiet adherence, especially those with high red/processed meat intake (Fig. 4b). The products of the enzyme, deoxycholate and lithocholate, are among the most well-studied secondary bile acids and can be hepatotoxic at elevated levels. Interestingly, the @sm$ lactose @/sm$ and galactose degradation pathway I (LACTOSECAT-PWY) and a constituent enzyme of the pathway (EC 3.2.1.85: 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase) showed lower abundance in individuals with a higher MedDiet index (Fig.	2
The binding of TNF to the extracellular domains of TNFR1 bridges the receptors, thus gathering the death domains of the cytoplasmic moiety and initiating the signaling cascade ending either in apoptosis or in the production of many inflammatory mediators (@sm$ eicosanoids @/sm$, proteases, free radicals, adhesion molecules...). TNF also induces the release of other cytokines, which can act in synergy with TNF within an amplificatory feedback loop (e.g. interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)), or which drive TNF-induced lethal shock (i.e. type I interferon, Huys et al,). In TNFR1 KO mice, both the negative impact of the deletion of the receptor in @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ infection, and the beneficial consequence when mice were injected with endotoxin or a Gram-positive-derived exotoxin were demonstrated (Pfeffer et al,).	3
The biofilm was incubated under anaerobic conditions (85% @sm$ N2 @/sm$, 10% H2, 5% CO2) at 37  C in an anaerobic chamber (Don Whitley Scientific Limited, West Yorkshire, UK). The culture medium was replaced after 48 h and selected species (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$) were added again.	0
The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and @sm$ gallic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ GA @/sm$) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and @sm$ GA @/sm$ produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, @sm$ GA @/sm$ did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.	3
The biosynthesis of @sm$ ansamycin @/sm$ was the only and slightly enriched pathway with Anaerotruncus spp., which has previously been reported in patients with lung, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Ansamycins such as rifamycin, ansamitocin, and geldanamycin are an important class of polyketide natural products. @sm$ Ansamycin @/sm$ antibiotics include important antibacterial agents, such as rifamycin, and anticancer agents such as ansamitocin. Previous studies have shown high expressions of Hsp90 in lung cancer specimens and that this is associated with a poor survival rate and lymphatic metastasis in lung cancer patients, indicating that the upregulation of Hsp90 can potentially facilitate the proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer. Ansamycins have also been shown to be able to bind to a conserved pocket in the NH2-terminal adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding domain of Hsp90, inhibiting its activity. A positive correlation between the biosynthesis of @sm$ ansamycin @/sm$ and Anaerotruncus spp. may represent a compensatory impact on lung cancer formation. However, the biosynthesis of @sm$ ansamycin @/sm$ was not significantly different between the lung cancer and normal groups in this study. Although the role of Anaerotruncus spp. in the development of lung cancer requires further investigation, the enrichment of @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ has been found in PD-1 blockade non-responders.	1
The blood @gm$ Typhimurium @/gm$ isolate S1027072 was resistant to the beta-lactams tested (@sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$: MIC 32 mg/L, ceftriaxone: MIC >256 mg/L), except for cefoxitin and imipenem, to gentamicin, to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and tetracyclin, and susceptible to amikacin, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin.	4
The bud exudates contain aromatic acids, @sm$ chalcones @/sm$, flavones, flavanone, terpenes, and fatty acids. This chemical profile was similar to propolis, with the only difference being the amount of these compounds. It is known that one of the propolis functions in the hive is the antibacterial activity exerted to protect the bees from different microbial invaders. Testing of the antibacterial activity of the poplar bud extracts and propolis found similar activities, mostly against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, L.	3
The catabolism of @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ by Roseburia produces hydrogen. However, as outlined above, it seems that butyrate-producing species were active without hydrogen formation. @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ perform the oligofructose degradation producing butyrate and CO2, but not H2 (Falony et al., 2009).	2
The changes in the percentage of Lactobacillus reuteri, Megasphaera cf, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ and Lactobacillus johnsonii were positively correlated with the changes in serum total bilirubin and the ratio of albumin and globulin, while were negatively correlated with the changes in serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, @sm$ potassium ion @/sm$, alkaline phosphatase and albumin. The changes in the percentage of Lactobacillus amylovorus, Kineothrix alysoides, Turicibacter sanguins and Treponema porcinum were positively correlated with the changes in serum chloride, alkaline phosphatase, @sm$ potassium ion @/sm$, alanine transaminase and creatinine, while were negatively correlated with the changes in serum globulin, total carbon dioxide, total bilirubin and the ratio of albumin and globulin ( Figure 9B ). Besides, abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri, Megasphaera cf, and Lactobacillus amylovorus have negative correlation with calcium ions, lactic acid, creatine kinase, amylase, inorganic phosphorus and total bilirubin; the abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii, Treponema porcinum, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ and Terrisporobacter mayorrbei have negative correlation with serum pH, total protein, total cholesterol; while negatively correlated with glucose, lactate and creatine kinase.	3
The changes of @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content of the tray packed sturgeon inoculated with different strains during ice storage are shown in Figure 2G the @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content of the fish in each experimental group showed an upward trend during storage. In the early stage of storage, @sm$ histamine @/sm$ production was less. On the 9th day, the @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content of fish in each treatment group was significantly different from that in the blank control group. This was mainly due to the small number of microorganisms, less histidine decarboxylase production and slow change of @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content. However, with the gradual adaptation of microorganisms to the storage environment, microbial growth and metabolism were vigorous. The increase of @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content in each experimental group was accelerated. After 9 days of storage, the @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content of Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Pseudomonas mandelii group increased significantly. On the 15th day, the @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content of Pseudomonas fluorescens group was significantly different from other experimental groups, reaching 24.170 +- 58 mg/100 g, while the @sm$ histamine @/sm$ content in Pseudomonas deceptionensis group and Pseudomonas sp. J-10 group increased slowly during storage, and reached 15.650 +- 0.41 mg/100 g, 14.76 +- 0.39 mg/100 g. This indicated that the ability of different microorganisms to promote @sm$ histamine @/sm$ production in fish was different, among which @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ was the strongest and Pseudomonas sp.	1
The clinical periodontal parameters @gm$ PI @/gm$, PD <3, 5 and 6 mm and BOP before and post-therapy in the PG were compared by paired Student's t-test, as well as lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, total white blood cell and blood glucose. In both periods evaluated for this group, a nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used for the following variables: number of teeth (NT), PD=4 and >7 mm, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), triglycerides, total @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$, HDL and LDL, eosinophils and basophils.	0
The clones of two types (T+ and T-) have been identified among the strains of @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$. The difference in the morphology of the clones is based on the ability of T+ clones to agglutinate in the process of growth. The identified clones are different in @sm$ calcium @/sm$ dependence, in the ability to agglutinate and in their virulence for the laboratory animals.	3
The control culture @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ [pMTL83251_PbgaL_AdhE2] that produced the non-tagged version of AdhE2 showed similar characteristics regarding growth rate and production patterns. Cells were grown with @sm$ glucose @/sm$ as a carbon source and reached a maximal OD600 of 2.5 with a growth rate of 0.17 h-1 when adhE2 gene expression was induced. Non-induced cells showed improved growth with a maximal OD600 of 2.8 and a growth rate of 0.2 h-1. The acetate:butyrate ratio was 6:1 in the case of the induced and 5:1 in the case of the non-induced cells. Gene expression of adhE2 in an inducible manner resulted in the production of up to 1.9 mM ethanol and 1.6 mM butanol at the end of the exponential growth phase. Non-induced cells only produced traces of ethanol and butanol (0.3 mM) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A, Table S1, Table 2). Both, the induced as well as the non-induced cells of @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ [pMTL83251_PbgaL_AdhE2] were cultivated with methanol and showed a growth rate of 0.05 h-1 with maximal OD600 values of 1.5 and 1.7, respectively.	2
The conventional Fmoc synthetic protocol was used for the synthesis of @sm$ peptides @/sm$. The @sm$ peptides @/sm$ were cleaved from the support using TFA. The @sm$ peptides @/sm$ were purified by HPLC, and characterized by amino acid analysis and MALDI TOF MS. The secondary structures of the @sm$ peptides @/sm$ were revealed by CD measurements. The synthesis of these @sm$ peptides @/sm$ illustrates the utility of the new support for the synthesis of long-chain bioactive @sm$ peptides @/sm$. The synthetic @sm$ peptides @/sm$ were tested for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli Mos blue, E. coli 2, Bacillus brevis, B. megaterium, Pseudomonas HTL, and @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$. The antibacterial activity of the @sm$ peptides @/sm$ was explained on the basis of the helicity and charged nature of the sequences.	3
The corresponding gene tetA located on the chromosome encoding TetA efflux protein (generally associated with MF superfamily) frequently observed in @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. isolates has been described to leave the host bacterium unharmed by actively transporting intracellular @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ out of cell cytoplasm.	4
The culture consisted of five types of bacteria; Bacillus sporogenes, Bacillus licheniformis, Capnocytophaga ochracea (presumably), Acinetobacter sporogenes and @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ which enriched with @sm$ Phenanthrene @/sm$ in our previous study.	2
The cysteine adducts of iso-MGS, NK30424A, and NK30424B could also inhibit the PLS-induced TNF-alpha production by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway, while 9-methylstreptimidone could inhibit NO production and iNOS expression in @sm$ LPS @/sm$-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Like 9-methylstreptimidone, we found glidofungin derivatives (2 and 4) from @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 10248 @/gm$ also had significant anti-inflammatory activities, which showed the potential for the development of leads for anti-inflammatory agents.	3
The cytokine release-inhibiting capabilities of @sm$ LPS @/sm$ from B. fragilis and @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ are notable as previous studies emphasize the pro-inflammatory activities of CRC-associated microbiota.	3
The degradation and fermentation of microcrystalline cellulose were studied in monoculture of the polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces joyonii and in co-cultures with the rumen bacteria @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ and Eubacterium limosum. More than 25% of cellulose hydrolysis products (@sm$ glucose @/sm$ and cellodextrins) were released by the fungus into the medium after 8 d of cultivation. These products were metabolized by bacteria in mixed cultures. In co-culture with the fungus @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ and E. limosum increased the extent of microcrystalline cellulose degradation by 10.12% and 7.96%, respectively. Biomass yield in co-cultures was increased by 89.9% and 59.4% for @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ and E. limosum. Y cellulose for fungus alone was 52.29 g dry matter mol-1 @sm$ glucose @/sm$. These values were 64.93 and 55.92 g mol-1 @sm$ glucose @/sm$ unit in co-culture with @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ and E.	2
The determination of enzymatic activities in cell-free extracts of @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus led to a refined scheme for the pathway of glutamate fermentation via (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate to @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate.	1
The diameter of selenium species referred to as lactomicroSel produced from yoghurt and @sm$ sodium selenite @/sm$ by probiotic bacteria (L. acidophilus, L. casei, and @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$) after isolation and purification estimated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was somewhat higher (100-500 nm) (Figure 3) than the size of the nanoparticles produced by L. casei alone (150-400 nm). This difference could come from the manipulation during isolation and purification or from the different particle size produced by different probiotic bacteria. To determine the size of nanomicroSe particles inside different probiotic bacteria we have used transmission electron microscopy. These TEM measurements in bacteria provided information regarding size and number of the lactomicroSel nanopartilces measured in lactobacilli in situ. The suicide production of thermophilomicroSe particles by @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ resulted in necrotic cell disruption.	1
The differences observed at 10 C may relate to differences in the expression of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ genes at cold versus warm temperatures, and to changes in @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) structure that occur at cold temperatures. For instance, it is possible that the upregulation of hms and the yersina murine toxin (ymt) gene, which is necessary for @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ survival in the flea gut, allows for the extensive bacterial growth observed in the flea at 10 C. It is also possible that the @sm$ LPS @/sm$ and extracellular matrix that forms at low temperatures may be more resistant to digestion, thus decreasing the chances that bacteria will be dislodged and transmitted during the early-phase period. However, if components of the host blood meal act to digest the @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ biofilm (e.g.,) then over time, the biofilm may begin to break-up, providing aggregates that may be subsequently transmitted or defecated.	4
The different ESVs included reduction of keystone resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ degrading, insulin sensitivity-associated and anti-inflammatory species, such as Ruminococcus bromii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus rogosae Anaerostipes hadrus, Blautia luti, and @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, as well as the enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria.	2
The differential gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and @sm$ lipids @/sm$ between the HR and NHR groups are found to be related to the development of T1D or other human autoimmune diseases in previous studies. In our study, we found that HR patients were characterized by enriched Prevotella copri, Desulfovibrio piger, Eubacterium siraeum, Sanguibacteroides, Gabonibacter timonensis, Puniceicoccaceae, Opitutales, Allisonella, @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$, and Holdemania.	0
The difficulty in making probiotics containing @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ may be due to its sensitivity to @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ and low pH, the strict oxalate demand for growth, and intolerance to the processes, which are commonly involved in the manufacture, storage, and distribution of probiotic products.	3
The diluted fecal sample was plated onto Brucella agar supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) horse blood for 2 to 4 days of incubation at 37 C in an environment containing an H2/CO2/@sm$ N2 @/sm$ (1:1:8, by volume) gas mixture. By screening the bacterial colonies with partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit with the Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously, @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ strain 2BBH45 was identified and isolated after plating three times.	0
The dominant genera in the duodenum of STH were @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ 1, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Ruminococcus 2, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group, Saccharofermentans, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, and Prevotellaceae UCG-001. Relative abundances of Prevotella 1, Ruminococcus 2, and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group were significantly higher in BLW, DLW, and DLW than in the other group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ 1 can degrade fiber-derived feeds such as hemicellulose or xylan. In addition, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ can use starch, monosaccharides, and other noncellulosic @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$. Ruminococcus 2 belongs to Ruminococcus, which primarily inhabits the rumen and hindgut of ruminants and contributes to the degradation of cellulose and starch. Ruminococcus also produces acetic acid, formic acid, and a small amount of lactic acid. Short-chain fatty acids, including formic acid and acetate, have key roles in regulating gut microbiota balance and maintaining the morphology and function of intestinal epithelial cells. The Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group functions in converting cholesterol to coproitol, which can further affect the fat metabolism of a host. We found that supplementation of EOZB increased significantly the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ 1 in the BLW group, Ruminococcus 2 and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group in the DLW group.	2
The drug susceptibility profiles of the tested organisms revealed that Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium simiae were the least susceptible to the tested drugs, whereas Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium asiaticum, @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium branderi, and Mycobacterium holsaticum were the most susceptible (Table 3 and Figure 1). Among the Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium avium was the most resistant to the tested drugs, whereas Mycobacterium intracellulare was the most susceptible (Figure 2). @sm$ Azithromycin @/sm$ was identified as the most effective antimicrobial agent against SGM species among the drugs tested, and dapsone was the least effective.	3
The drugs used were always a triple combination of the following drugs: doxycycline, @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$, streptomycin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and ceftriaxone. Diazepam and valproate were used for managing associated seizures (if any). In 20% of the cases, neurobrucellosis was confused with and misdiagnosed as disseminated tuberculosis. In 90% of the cases, the patients became asymptomatic after the respective course of treatment; though in one case, a patient died due to misdiagnosis and late starting of antimicrobials against @gm$ Brucella @/gm$.	3
The effect of fluoride in caries control may be due to disruption of the ecological balance in the mouth, through prevention of adsorption of salivary glycoproteins to hydroxyapatite or perhaps by inhibiting growth of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ directly. Fluoride caused inhibition of growth rate of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ with glucose as the primary energy and @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source. Metabolism of glucose or lactose requires enolase enzyme. It is the most fluoride-sensitive enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Fermentative growth which is dependent upon glycolysis is inhibited by fluoride and thus blocks phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) synthesis. Since PEP is used for both energy and transport in @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$, fluoride is detrimental to growth for @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$.	3
The effect of proteolytic starter cultures of Staphylococcus carnosus and @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ on biogenic amine production was examined during the fermentation process of dry sausages. Microbial counts (lactic acid bacteria, Micrococcaceae and Enterobactenaceae), pH, moisture and proteolysis-related parameters were also studied. The polyamines spermine and spermidine were the main @sm$ amines @/sm$ found in the raw material and they only showed slight fluctuations during the fermentation. The four elaborated batches presented a significant (P < 0.001) formation of tyramine and putrescine. The main rate of @sm$ amine @/sm$ production was during the first three days, when a sharp pH decrease and the development of lactic acid bacteria occurred. Sausages fermented with starters had lower amounts of tyramine than naturally fermented sausages (control), but differences in the Micrococcaceae counts were only significant during the first week of the ripening process. A slight formation of diaminopropane, cadaverine, agmatine, tryptamine and phenylethylamine was observed. The amounts of histamine were constant and remained below 0.5 mg/kg of dry matter, while serotonin, octopamine and dopamine were not detected. The sausages with @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ as starter culture showed strong proteolysis that was correlated with higher pH values than those of the control sausages. However, no positive correlation was found between the proteolysis index and biogenic amine production. Since proteolysis was stronger during the second half of the ripening process, the release of free amino acids as @sm$ amine @/sm$ precursors occurred later than the early @sm$ amine @/sm$ production.	1
The effect of the laser irradiation (532 nm) on films prepared from @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ mixed with erythrosine dye was investigated by using atomic force microscopy. It was observed that morphological changes of bacterial surfaces after irradiations, which were attributed to cellular damage of the outer membranes, are a result of a photodynamic effect. The results suggested that the combination of @sm$ erythrosine @/sm$ and laser light at 532 nm could be a candidate to a photodynamic therapy against @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$.	3
The effects of hydrated clay minerals on @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ growth and wound progression in infected mice are likely due to a combination of both physical and chemical characteristics of clay minerals. Clays are small phyllosilicate minerals that are commonly grouped into three main classes - smectite, illite and kaolinite - based on their overall crystal layer structure and expandability. Smectite minerals, which include @sm$ montmorillonite clay @/sm$, exhibit high expansion (swelling) capabilities in the presence of water. Conversely, illite and kaolinite are non-expanding clays. We have previously assessed the ability of different hydrated clays to treat MRSA-infected superficial, cutaneous wounds in mice. We demonstrated that natural and ion-exchanged illite clays performed best, as measured by bacterial load, inflammatory response and gross wound morphology with significant decreases in bacterial viability and dermatitis. Topical application of kaolinite clay was the least effective, resulting in the lowest decrease in bacterial load and exhibiting severe dermatitis. Although the CB09 clay mixture used in this study is a heterogeneous mixture of illite-smectite, @sm$ montmorillonite @/sm$, kaolinite, and non-clay minerals with different structural and expansion properties, daily application and removal of the clay poultices could diminish @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ growth due to an unfavorable chemical environment and could result in physical removal of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ and/or mycolactone via adsorption. Mycolactone plays a central role in the pathogenesis of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ and is thought to be responsible for most of the tissue destruction that occurs in a Buruli ulcer wound.	3
The emergence of ESBL-producing @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ spp. has been observed in many countries. In the current study, only 3 ARG genotypes (bla OXA-1, bla TEM-1 and bla CTX-M-14) were detected. Among them, the bla TEM-1 gene was detected in all 19 cephalosporin-resistant isolates. In total, 174 bla TEM variants resistant to @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ and other ss-lactamase antibiotics have been recorded.	4
The environmental changes may be attributed to arecoline which increases saliva secretion, stimulating sympathetic nerve and choline M receptor, nicotine, carbon monoxide, @sm$ hydrogen cyanide @/sm$, benzene, formaldehyde, phenol, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tobacco-specific nitrosamines modulating pH. Reports point out that saccharolytic metabolism produces acids lowering the pH and allowing transitory acid tolerant and acidophiles including cariogenic bacteria to grow leading to dysbiosis. Based on the tree clade, it can be stated that P. aeruginosa (141C Intox), P. cedrina, (387C)-unidentified organism, Serratia marcescens (168B Intox), Bacillus sp (OS1 Intox), @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (162A Intox) are possible colonizers replacing the commensal microbes.	0
The enzyme stability at 10% polar solvent concentrations have also been reported in few cases such as Serratia marcescens (Zhao et al.), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus megaterium, and @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ (Gaur et al.). Water-miscible hydrophilic solvents with log P < 2 such as methanol, @sm$ acetonitrile @/sm$, and ethyl acetate are usually incompatible with the activity of a protein; whereas, water-immiscible lipophilic solvents, such as hexane, cyclohexane, isooctane, and n-hexadecan retain the enzyme's high catalytic activity due to this fact that they do not remove the crucial bound water from the enzyme's surface leading to its unfolding and reducing stability of the biocatalyst.	0
The enzyme was solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 in 0.5 M @sm$ NaCl @/sm$ and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-Sepharose. The activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on Na+ (Km = 3 mM) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. The glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ and Clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent Km for Na+ (1 mM) and were not stimulated by phospholipids.	3
The evidence suggests that this pathogenic gut-brain circuit involves: (i) @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) from the GI-tract resident enterotoxigenic Gram-negative bacteria @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (BF-@sm$ LPS @/sm$); (ii) @sm$ LPS @/sm$ transit across the GI-tract barrier into the systemic circulation; (iii) transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic BF-@sm$ LPS @/sm$ across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain-parenchyma and neuronal-cytoplasm; (iv) activation and signaling via the pro-inflammatory NF-kB (p50/p65) transcription-factor complex; (v) NF-kB-coupling and significant up-regulation of the inducible pro-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) and microRNA-155 (miRNA-155); each containing multiple NF-kB DNA-binding and activation sites in their immediate promoters; and (vi) subsequent down-regulation of miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 regulated mRNA targets such as that encoding complement factor H (CFH), a soluble complement control glycoprotein and key repressor of the innate-immune response. Down-regulated CFH expression activates the complement-system, the major non-cellular component of the innate-immune system while propagating neuro-inflammation. Other GI-tract microbes and their highly complex pro-inflammatory exudates may contribute to this pathogenic GI-tract-brain pathway. We speculate that it may be significant that the first Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species intensively studied as a potential contributor to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that being the bacillus @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ appears to utilize damaged or leaky physiological barriers and an activated NF-kB (p50-p65) - pro-inflammatory miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 signaling circuit to convey microbiome-derived pathogenic signals into the brain.	1
The experiment had a completely randomized block design with the following treatments: control soil (C), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil:VA1), soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil:VA10), soil inoculated with @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ (1.6 x 107 cells/g soil; @gm$ Cit @/gm$), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil) and with @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$ (1.6 x 107 cells/g soil; VA1+@gm$ Cit @/gm$), and soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil) and @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$ (1.6 x 107 cells/g soil; VA10+@gm$ Cit @/gm$). There were three replications of each treatment for each sampling time, which produced a total of 90 pots in the experiment (i.e., six treatments x three replications x five sampling times). In order to ensure an even distribution of the antibiotic in the soil, the VA solution was prepared in sterile pure water and then added to sterile @sm$ quartz @/sm$ sand (<0.5 mm).	0
The experiments were performed at different temperatures (37, 42 C; Figures 2A,B), in different media (Supplementary Information), supplemented with an amino acid mixture containing alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and serine (Figure 2C), and also individually supplemented with alanine (Figure 2D), @sm$ asparagine @/sm$ (Figure 2F), tryptophan (Figure 2E), or salts such as 0.2 M CH3COONa (Figure 2G) and 0.25 M NaCl (Figure 2H). The growth rate of the bacteria varied between species when the temperature was increased. All the species reached stationary phase after 36-48 h, at 37 C and after 42-60 h, at 42 C (Figures 1B,C). Rather than considering all 63 different species of Bifidobacterium, we selected species representative of the groups of: B. animalis (DSM 10140), @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ (@gm$ DSM 20083 @/gm$), and B. longum (DSM 20219). We subjected them to different conditions, and observed any morphological changes with SEM. Figures 2, 10 clearly demonstrates the effects of each condition on the Bifidobacterial morphology. @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$ (@gm$ DSM 20083 @/gm$) metamorphosed from a bifid to a rod when grown on medium supplemented with alanine (A), @sm$ asparagine @/sm$ (N), or 0.25 M NaCl. When B. longum (DSM 20219) was grown on medium supplemented with the four amino acids (Ala, Asp, Glu, and Ser), or separately with alanine (A) or @sm$ asparagine @/sm$ (N), its morphology changed from elongated rods to bifids.	2
The fermentation pattern of @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ of T. medium resembled that of @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ and Treponema denticola, but T. medium was clearly differentiated from @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ in the production of indole, and from T.	2
"The final evidence that they represent a new order of methanogens was recently given with the isolation of Methanomassiliicoccus luminyenis B10 from human feces  and the culture in consortia of several strains of this order: ""Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus""  and ""@gm$ Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$""  from human feces samples, MpT1 and MpM2  from termite gut and ""Candidatus Methanogranum caenicola""  from waste treatment sludge. All the culture-based studies agreed on a common methanogenic pathway relying on the obligate dependence of the strains on an external @sm$ H2 @/sm$ source to reduce methyl-compounds into methane. The restriction to this metabolism was previously only observed in two methanogens from digestive tract (Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanomicrococcus blatticola) and considered an exception . The apparently large distribution of this obligate metabolism among this novel order of methanogens turns this exception into one of the important pathways among the overall methanogens. It also highlights the need for a more cautious utilisation of the term of ""hydrogenotrophic methanogens"" which is generally used to refer to methanogens growing on @sm$ H2 @/sm$ + CO2, but also fits for an increasing number of described methanogens growing on @sm$ H2 @/sm$ + methyl-compounds."	2
The first IncQ plasmid group was isolated from @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ and included two identical plasmids, pHP18 and pAB4, and one variant pHP1. Plasmid pHP18, the sole plasmid found in this study, which was capable of mobilization through conjugation, was 6,388 bp in size with a G+C content of 57%. It contained 6 ORFs: repA and repC genes for plasmid replication, mobA and mobC genes for plasmid mobilization, the qnrS2 gene for @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance, and a repressor gene (Table 2). The qnrS2 gene was 100% identical with its @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp.	4
The first environmental condition provided benzyl alcohol, producing a symbiotic interaction between the two species in which @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ metabolized benzyl alcohol and secreted @sm$ benzoate @/sm$, the nutrient source for Pseudomonas putida. The second condition provided citrate, producing a competitive interaction, as citrate can be directly consumed by both species, that favored P. putida in co-culture. In 6-day-long experiments in which the nutrient source fluctuated on 1-3-day timescales, oscillations in community composition maintained both species throughout the experiment, whereas fluctuations on 4-5-day timescales led to the extinction of @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$. These longer fluctuation timescales exceed the timescale required for @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ to go extinct in citrate.	1
The first microbial CHI enzyme was discovered in @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$; its role is the isomerization of naringenin chalcone to @sm$ naringenin @/sm$.	1
The first of these studies addressed temporal changes in gene expression during a temperature transition from 26 to 37 C mimicking transmission of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ from the flea vector to its mammalian host (Motin et al.,). Transcriptional profiling revealed that about 10% of the chromosomal genes were influenced by temperature of which the majority encodes important metabolic functions. The thermal induced global changes caused an inhibition of glycolysis while terminal oxidation of a variety of carbohydrates, amino acids, and @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ known to exist in the host was favored. This suggested that plague bacilli might favor fermentative pathways during slow growth within the flea, whereas they prefer oxidative catabolism during rapid proliferation in mammals (Motin et al.,). Another analysis addressing differential protein expression in @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ following a thermal upshift also demonstrated that several enzymes involved in sugar metabolism (e.g., alpha-enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase) are under thermal control (Chromy et al.,).	2
The first one was a SelD gene in @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ that could not be identified due to a sequence error in the genomic data. The second one was the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) domain protein in Geobacter sulfurreducens. Here, the @sm$ selenocysteine @/sm$ residue is situated too close to the carboxyl terminus, thus causing a very low RSA Z-value (1.8).	0
The flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) system from @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ is composed of the electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd). alpha-FAD binds to domain II of the A-subunit of EtfAB, beta-FAD to the B-subunit of EtfAB and delta-FAD to Bcd. @sm$ NADH @/sm$ reduces beta-FAD to beta-FADH- , which bifurcates one electron to the high potential alpha-FAD - semiquinone followed by the other to the low potential ferredoxin (Fd).	2
The flavone apigenin (66) showed the strongest XO inhibitory activity while @sm$ oleuropein @/sm$ (1), caffeic acid (119), luteolin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (64), and luteolin (68) also showed significant contribution in XO inhibition. Water extract of the fresh terminal branches of O. europaea ssp. africana inhibited peptidase and glycosidase enzyme activities which are produced by the periodontopathic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$.	0
The following @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ strains were used: M90T AfaI, expressing the adhesin afaI (Figs 1B, 2, 3C-3E and 4A-4C), the invasive DeltaipgD AfaI (Figs 1B and 5B), M90T (Figs 1C and 4D), DeltaipgD (1C) and M90T expressing dsRed (Fig 1A and 1D). For the two mutant library screens (Fig 3A and 3B) all @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ strains used were kindly provided by JR. Rohde (Dalhousie University): the strains do not express afaI and are a part of a pwR100 collection. The parent strain for this collection is a streptomycin-resistant strain of @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ serotype 5a (M90T-Sm). Growth medium was supplemented with ampicillin (50 mug/ml) for all strains except for DeltaipgD supplemented with @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (5 mug/ml).	4
The following correlations between OTUs and VOCs were found: i) negative correlations (genus-level) with Dorea and @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$ for 1-propanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, heptanal, hexanal, nonanal, octanal, propyl butyrate, and treatadecane (all p<=0.05) (S9 Table). Similarly, at the species level, D. formicigerans and @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ were significantly negatively (p<=0.05) correlated with 1-propanol, ethanol, ethyl butyrate, heptanal, hexanal, nonanal, octanal, propyl butyrate, and treatadecane. At the genus level, Clostridiaceae, Propionibacterium, and Pediococcus all were positively correlated with most detected molecules, including alcohols (i.e., ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-octanol), @sm$ esters @/sm$ (i.e., ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, propyl butyrate), aldehydes (i.e., heptanal, hexanal, octanal), phenols (i.e., 4-methylphenol), and pyridine; however, only Pediococcus and Propionibacterium had statistically significant correlations (p<=0.05).	3
The full-length @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$ LUSH protein fused with the His6-GST tag was used for the assay. The L. pneumophila ubiquitin ligase LubX with C-terminal truncation (residue 1-186) was used as the positive control for the in vitro ubiquitination assay. The human E2D2 was used as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. The experiment was conducted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM @sm$ dithiothreitol @/sm$, overnight at 25  C.	0
The genera Anaerotruncus and Oscillibacter as well as Ruminococcus torques and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ were relatively enriched in patients with AMD, whereas Bacteroides eggerthii was enriched in controls. Patient's intestinal microbiomes were enriched in genes of the L-alanine fermentation, @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ degradation and arginine biosynthesis pathways and decreased in genes of the fatty acid elongation pathway.	2
The genera Christensenellaceae R-7_group, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ were positively involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (KO 00400). The pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (KO 00770) was positively associated with the genera Bacteroides. Moreover, the genus unclassified Lachnospiraceae also positively participated in starch and sucrose metabolism (KO 00500), lysine biosynthesis (KO 00300), and valine, @sm$ leucine @/sm$, and isoleucine biosyntheses (KO 00290) while the genus @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ was positively correlated with cysteine and methionine metabolisms (KO 00270).	2

The genes coding the putative thiocyanate hydrolase have a GC content of 41-43%, which is significantly higher than the average @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content of the @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ genome, which is 38%. When searching for the closest homologues according to BLAST searches we identified them in the genomes of Rhodococcus opacus strain B4 and Nocardia farcinica spp. These two are high G+C Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Actinomycetales, which are phylogenetically not closely related to Legionella suggesting that @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ acquired these genes by horizontal gene transfer.	0
The genes for @sm$ fucose @/sm$ catabolism were present in only V. vulnificus, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, V. nigripulchritudo, V. shilonii, V. harveryi HENC-01 and Vibrio sp EJY3. Our examination of the fucA gene from this pathway shows that its closest homologue is present in enteric species. In V. vulnificus YJ016, the @sm$ fucose @/sm$ catabolism gene cluster is present within a 117 kb island. The genomic island is inserted at a tRNA serine locus, contains an integrase and has an overall GC content of 43%. The island region encompasses VV2149 to VV2262 in YJ016 and is largely absent in MO6-24/O and CMCP6 but the @sm$ fucose @/sm$ catabolism cluster is present in MO6-24/O.	2
The genes responsible for making the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ exopolysaccharide matrix are located in two clusters (vpsU, vpsA-K) and vpsL-Q on @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ chromosome I. These clusters comprise two operons in which vpsA and vpsL are the first genes of operon I and II, respectively. A third gene cluster, rbmA-F, located between the vpsA-K and vpsL-Q operons and bap1, encodes protein components of the biofilm matrix. When the intracellular concentration of @sm$ c-di-GMP @/sm$ is elevated, VpsR and VpsT enhance the expression of vps and rbm genes required to make the biofilm matrix.	1
The genes that were related to @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance in ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates were detected using previously described primers (Table 1), including gyrA, ParC, PMQR genes qnrA, qnrB and qnrS, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase-encoding enzyme variant aac(6 )-Ib-cr, and efflux-pump-encoding qepA. Amplicons of gyrA and ParC were sequenced and their mutations were determined via aligning the sequenced amplicons against the counterpart sequence of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2. Additionally, beta-lactam-resistant @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ isolates were tested for beta-lactamase gene blaTEM that was previously found in beta-lactam-resistant Salmonella isolates using primers listed in Table 1.	4
The genome comprises two large chromosomes of 2.24 and 0.73 Mbp, leading us to propose the name @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$ for this new species. Analysis of the carbohydrate active enzyme complement suggests an ability to utilize certain hemicelluloses, especially beta-glucans and xyloglucan, for growth that was confirmed experimentally. The enzymatic machinery enabling the degradation of cellulose and xylan by related cellulolytic ruminococci is however lacking in this species. While the genome indicated the capacity to synthesize purines, @sm$ pyrimidines @/sm$ and all 20 amino acids, only genes for the synthesis of nicotinate, NAD+, NADP+ and coenzyme A were detected among the essential vitamins and co-factors, resulting in multiple growth requirements.	2
The genomes of @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ and Treponema pallidum contain a gene, licCA, which is predicted to encode a fusion protein containing choline kinase and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activities. Because both organisms have been reported to contain phosphatidylcholine, this raises the possibility that they use a CDP-choline pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine. This report shows that phosphatidylcholine is a major phospholipid in @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$, accounting for 35-40% of total phospholipid. This organism readily incorporated [14C]choline into phosphatidylcholine, indicating the presence of a choline-dependent biosynthetic pathway. The licCA gene was cloned, and recombinant LicCA had choline kinase and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. The licCA gene was disrupted in @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ by erythromycin cassette mutagenesis, resulting in a viable mutant. This disruption completely blocked incorporation of either [14C]choline or 32Pi into phosphatidylcholine. The rate of production of another phospholipid in @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$, phosphatidylethanolamine, was elevated considerably in the licCA mutant, suggesting that the elevated level of this @sm$ lipid @/sm$ compensated for the loss of phosphatidylcholine in the membranes. Thus it appears that @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ does contain a licCA-dependent CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.	1
The genomic DNA @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content of the strains was estimated at 27.5 mol% using the Geneious R10 software package. Comparisons of genome size and @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content were performed relative to 3210 genomes available in the NCBI RefSeq database that are assigned to the genus ' @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ '. Genomes were downloaded using the NCBI genome download tool (available at https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download). NCBI-assigned species taxon identifiers were used to group the data. Analysis and visualizations were performed in RStudio. The genome sizes of the  C. novaezeelandiae  isolates fell within the range of  @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$  (Fig. 2), however the  C. novaezeelandiae  isolates possessed the lowest @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content of all current members of the genus  @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$  (Fig.	0
The genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ contains anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that present a bifurcated, termed 'bifid', morphology under certain growth conditions in some species. Bifidobacteria are commonly found in animal gastrointestinal tracts including mammals, birds, and insects. These bacteria have been extensively characterized regarding their ability to metabolize host-indigestible @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, which often enables their persistence within the gut environment.	2
The genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ represents one of the most important bacterial group in human and animal feces. This organism has stringent nutrient requirements and grows poorly outside of the animal gut, making this bacterial group a potentially useful indicator of fecal pollution as previously described. In addition, an advantage in using bifidobacteria instead of other fecal contamination indicators is the host specificity, human or animal, of some groups of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species contrary to coliforms, which are ubiquitous. For example, @sm$ sorbitol @/sm$-fermenting bifidobacteria are associated with human fecal pollution, while B.	2
The genus @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ has been associated with both negative and positive health outcomes in the wider human population. Increases in the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ genus have been associated with diets high in plant-based fiber and lower in animal-based fats, as well as with the production of anti-inflammatory fecal short chain fatty acids. As such, gut microbiota dominant in the genus @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ may be linked to potential health benefits. In particular, P. copri has been associated in several studies with improved @sm$ glucose @/sm$ metabolism or overall anti-inflammatory effects of diet.	2
The genus Lactobacillus exhibited a positive correlation with the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (KO 00010) while it exhibited a negatively correlation with the glycine, @sm$ serine @/sm$, and threonine metabolisms (KO 00260). The genus Bacillus was positively involved in the propanoate metabolism (KO 00640) and butanoate metabolism (KO 00650) pathways but was negatively correlated with both galactose metabolism (KO 00052) and methane metabolism (KO 00680). The genera Christensenellaceae R-7_group, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ were positively involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (KO 00400). The pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (KO 00770) was positively associated with the genera Bacteroides. Moreover, the genus unclassified Lachnospiraceae also positively participated in starch and sucrose metabolism (KO 00500), lysine biosynthesis (KO 00300), and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosyntheses (KO 00290) while the genus @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ was positively correlated with cysteine and methionine metabolisms (KO 00270).	3
The glucose concentration in the dark chamber gradually decreased due to consumption by @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ B49. The glucose diffused spontaneously from the photo to the dark chamber for further consumption by @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ B49. Consequently, the glucose concentration in the photo chamber was slightly higher than that in the dark chamber, but glucose concentration in both chambers decreased following the same trend. Acetate diffused into the photo chamber through the membrane and was converted by RLD-53 into @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ and carbon dioxide. The acetate production rate by B49 was much faster than the consumption rate of R. faecalis RLD-53. Consequently, acetate accumulated in the reactor, and reached maximum value at about 72 h. The maximum accumulation of acetate decreased from 34.95 mmol/L to 26.72 mmol/L with the increase of photo chamber working volume. A previous study showed that acetate has been proved to have an inhibitory effect on @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production by E. harbinese B49. In the IDPFR, acetate consumed by R. faecalis RLD-53 could alleviate the inhibition of acetate on @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production and also facilitate a stable pH of the coupled system.	2
The green tea extract showed IC50 of 0.088 mg/mL and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.05 mg/mL for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.025 mg/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.04 mg/mL for Escherichia coli, and >1.0 mg/mL for @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$. The formulation with 15% (w/v) of gelatin and 30% (w/w) of @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ showed better adhesion and appearance in the coating of the product.	4
The green tea extract showed IC50 of 0.088 mg/mL and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.05 mg/mL for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.025 mg/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.04 mg/mL for Escherichia coli, and >1.0 mg/mL for @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$. The formulation with 15% (w/v) of gelatin and 30% (w/w) of glycerol showed better adhesion and appearance in the coating of the product. When using 1.0% of green tea extract, the lowest IC50, was obtained and the antioxidant activity was maintained for 35 days. There was a more accentuated decrease in pH and an increase in acidity and @sm$ peroxide @/sm$ index in fresh sausages without film compared to those coated with the active film (1.0% of green tea extract) during storage.	3
The growth curves of @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ strains cultured in minimal medium (MM) supplemented with a sole carbohydrate were measured as previously described with the following modifications (Martens et al,). The wells of a non-tissue culture flat bottom 96-well were loaded with 100 microl sterilized carbohydrate stocks (2x concentration). Each carbohydrate was added into at least three wells. @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ was grown in MM + @sm$ Glucose @/sm$ to an OD600 value of approximately 0.6.	2
"The growth of Methanobrevibacter is supported by fermenters such as Gastranaerophilales and butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaereostipes via interspecies formate/@sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ transfer. A study in mice determined that @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ facilitates Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron capacity to digest glycans resulting in increased production of short-chain fatty acids. The same study defined @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ as a ""power broker"" that regulates polysaccharide fermentation efficiency that influences the fat stores. The lower prevalence of methanogenic archaea in farm A could be explained by the high presence of SRB that outcompete with methanogens for @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ consumption."	2
The gut microbiota includes probiotics (mainly @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacteria) and opportunistic pathogens (members of the Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, etc.). @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ collaborates with other endogenous, beneficial bacteria to maintain gut homeostasis. Through competition and the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites, these microbes also play an important role in preventing pathogen colonization. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ secretion (@sm$ lactic acid @/sm$) is converted to butyric acid by other bacteria in the gut, preventing @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ accumulation. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ has also been shown to maintain intestinal barrier integrity by acting on epithelial cells. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ also stimulates adaptive immune responses by activating macrophages and lymphocytes, indicating its role in the host's immune response. In addition, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ has been shown to bind to mucosal epithelial cells easily and to play an immunomodulatory role by lowering the expression of proinflammatory interleukin and toll-like receptors. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, which is normally beneficial in healthy people, can be invasive and fatal in people with gut dysbiosis. For example, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ can cause severe infection in immunocompromised people. Over 200 @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$-infected cases with various disorders have been reported. Additional probiotic formulations containing @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ were linked to increased mortality in pancreatitis patients.	1
The gut microbiota of humans are dominated by the genus Bacteroides, and can be split into enterotypes, based on the amount of Bacteroides and whether a decrease in Bacteroides is accompanied by an increase in @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae, or Prevotella. The Prevotella-dominant enterotype is associated with a long-term diet high in @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, like the Malawi diet.	2
The hemagglutination activities were commonly inhibited by the glycoproteins bearing high-@sm$ mannose @/sm$ N-glycans, but not by monosaccharides examined, including @sm$ mannose @/sm$. In a direct binding experiment with pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, an isolectin EDA-2 exclusively bound to high-@sm$ mannose @/sm$ type N-glycans, but not to other glycans that include complex types and a core pentasaccharide of N-glycans, indicating that it recognized the branched oligomannoside moiety. Its binding activity was subtly different among the oligomannoside structures examined, showing that the lectin has preference affinity for high-@sm$ mannose @/sm$ type N-glycans with an exposed (alpha1-3) mannose residue in the D2 arm. Interestingly, EDAs, the mixture of three isolectins inhibited the growth of shrimp pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, although it did not affect the growth of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ and V. harveyi. Growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus with EDAs was not observed in the presence of yeast mannan bearing high-@sm$ mannose @/sm$ N-glycans, suggesting that EDAs caused the activity through binding to the target receptor(s) on the surface of V.	0
The human-associated methanogen @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ is found in roughly 95% of individuals. This microorganism plays an important role in the gut ecosystem by consuming hydrogen produced by fermentative members of the intestinal microflora, preventing the stalling of metabolic processes due to high product concentrations. @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ obtains energy by reducing CO2 with electrons from hydrogen; however, other methanogens are known to utilize other substrates found in the human gut, such as methanol or methylamines. To gain insight into the diversity of human-associated methanogens, we isolated @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ WWM1085 from a human stool sample (Mayo Clinic, biome number 101159) in the presence of CO2-H2 as a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and energy source.	2
The important biochemical features of this organism include conversion of nitrate to nitrite, do not cleave L-lysine or @sm$ ornithine @/sm$, activate arginine dihydrolase, produce indole but not acetoin, ferment sucrose, D-mannitol, L-arabinose, maltose, trehalose, D-galactose, and D-galacturonate. Most of the vibrios, including V. fluvialis occur widely in the aquatic milieu,mostly in the seas, estuaries and brackish waters. Even though more than 100 spices have been reported in the Genus Vibrio , about 13 of them have been reported to cause several human diseases. Among the pathogenic vibrios, V. alginolyticus, V. cholerae, V. costicola, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, V.	0
The in vitro activities of the N,N-dimethylglycylamido derivatives of minocycline (DMG-MINO) and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline (DMG-DMDOT) were compared with those of minocycline, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, clindamycin, and metronidazole by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth agar dilution method. The MICs of DMG-MINO, DMG-DMDOT, and metronidazole at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (0.5, 1, and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively) were lower than those for clindamycin, minocycline, and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (4, 8, and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). All of the strains of anaerobes tested, except one strain of @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$ (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml), were susceptible to DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT at 8 micrograms/ml.	3
The in vitro activity of @sm$ rifampin @/sm$, rifabutin, rifapentine, and levofloxacin against planktonic and biofilm states of 126 Streptococcus and Enterococcus PJI isolates was tested. Isolates were collected between 1996 and 2018 from separate patients with infected arthroplasties managed at the Mayo Clinic and included 61 isolates of E. faecalis, 6 E. faecium, 23 S. agalactiae, 1 S. pyogenes, 6 S. dysgalactiae, 17 @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ group, 6 S. anginosus group, 4 S. salivarius group, 1 S. mutans group, and 1 S. gallolyticus. E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 were used as quality control strains. @sm$ Rifampin @/sm$, rifabutin, rifapentine, and levofloxacin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) MICs were determined by broth microdilution by following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. @sm$ Rifampin @/sm$ and levofloxacin were prepared following CLSI guidelines. Rifabutin and rifapentine were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol, respectively, per the manufacturer's instructions. Current CLSI @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ breakpoints for enterococci are <=1  mug/ml susceptible, 2  mug/ml intermediate, and >=4  mug/ml resistant. There are no @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ breakpoints defined by the CLSI for beta-hemolytic or viridans group streptococci. No rifabutin or rifapentine breakpoints are defined for any of the tested bacteria. EUCAST @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ breakpoints for Streptococcus groups A, B, C, and G are <=0.06  mug/ml susceptible and >0.5  mug/ml resistant, and the EUCAST epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) for viridans group streptococci is 0.125  mug/ml.	3
The in vitro antibacterial activity of FK-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three Spanish hospitals. FK-037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC90 1 microgram/ml), @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ and Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml). In cefotaxime- and @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing SHV-2 and SHV-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (MIC range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). In Enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, FK-037 (MIC90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ but two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. FK-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ and cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with MIC90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. The activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$-resistant derepressed Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants.	4
The in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was compared with those of @sm$ clotrimazole @/sm$, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (BV) or skin infections by agar dilution MIC determinations. BV-associated @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ isolates of the @gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$-B. oralis group, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, @sm$ clotrimazole @/sm$, and miconazole; but Bacteroides spp. not associated with BV, Bacteroides ureolyticus and the Bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. All @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G.	3
The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of all identified @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolates to the commonly prescribed antibiotics in Nigeria were investigated by disk diffusion method, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The following antibiotic discs were used: cefpodoxime (CPD) (30 microg), cefoxitin (FOX) (30 microg), cefotaxime (CTX) (30 microg), ceftazidime (CAZ) 30 microg, ampicillin (AMP) 10 microg, ciprofloxacin (CPR) 5 microg, augmentin (AUG) 30 microg, ofloxacin (OFL) 5 microg, imipenem (IMP) 10 microg, ertapenem (ETR) 10 microg, doripenem (DOR) 10 microg, @sm$ amikacin @/sm$ 30 microg (AMK), and gentamycin (GEN) 10 microg (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). Each of the antibiotic's discs was placed aseptically on Mueller Hinton agar (HIMEDIA, Mumbai, India) plates that were previously inoculated with the @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ suspension equal to 0.5 McFarland standard and the plates were incubated aerobically at 37  C for 18-24 h.	3
The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, @sm$ ornidazole @/sm$, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and @sm$ ornidazole @/sm$. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, B.	3
The in vitro susceptibility test showed that @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ H7 exhibited resistance to eight of the 23 antibiotics tested. It showed higher MIC levels (>=64mug/ml) for ribostamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, and nalidixic acid. It was susceptible to many other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides (such as kanamycin, neomycin, and @sm$ tobramycin @/sm$) and all the beta-lactams tested (except aztreonam; Table 3).	4
The increase in adiposity could be rescued when co-housing animals with lean HMA mice, and the most prominent invading species were Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides uniformis, @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$, and Parabacteroides merdae. The presence of the last three Bacteroidetes species positively correlated with cecal @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate levels.	1
The inflammatory manifestations of acne result from @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ colonization, and are of particular relevance as they can develop into nodules and cysts, potentially leading to permanent scarring. Acne severity is classified according to different scales. It is widely agreed, however, that the mild and moderate forms of acne display primary lesions only, while severe acne also includes nodules, cysts, and eventually open lesions. It is noteworthy that acne severity and scarring have been related to @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ inflammatory factors, bacterial growth metabolites such as allergens, toxins, or @sm$ porphyrins @/sm$, and enzymes.	1
The intracellular life of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ in the DC is very interesting. @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ does not get killed or proliferate in the DC population. Intracellular survival of @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ in murine DC was independent from the function of virulence factors known to be important for survival in macrophages, such as the SPI2-T3SS. Surprisingly, the bacterial LPS O antigen is found to be very crucial to maintain bacterial steady burden in the DCs. As known from previous studies, the effect of CpG mediated TLR-9 activation on @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ proliferation is a cell line dependent phenomenon. In the case of cultured hepatocytes, @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ growth is inhibited by the CpG DNA treatment, whereas in the case of human monocyte-derived macrophages it has no effect. In hepatocytes, an enhanced @sm$ ROS @/sm$ production after the CpG DNA treatment has been attributed to be the cause of decreased @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ burden. However, in bone marrow derived macrophages CpG-antagonist act in a TLR-9 independent manner to inhibit @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ killing. Our study is the first report which indicates that in the dendritic cells CpG DNA enhances @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ killing. We went ahead to check the exact mechanism behind, and noticed that CpG induction leads to an enhanced generation of @sm$ ROS @/sm$ from the infected cells. To look into the mechanism behind this phenomenon, we blocked the @sm$ ROS @/sm$ production in the ligand treated infected dendritic cells. Under that condition this enhanced killing was no more observed. This finding clearly demonstrates that the CpG treatment allows better killing of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ in a @sm$ ROS @/sm$ dependent manner.	3
The isolated strains belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Limosilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Lacticaseibacillus, Staphylococcus and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ were grown overnight at 37  C under static conditions as previously described on MRS basal medium containing: bactopeptone (Difco), 10 g l-1; yeast extract (Pronadisa), 4 g l-1; sodium acetate, 5 g l-1; tri-ammonium citrate, 2 g l-1; magnesium sulphate 7-hydrate, 0.2 g l-1; manganese sulphate monohydrate, 0.05 g l-1; Tween 80, 1 ml l-1 and l-cysteine 0.1%. Overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 595 nm of 0.1 in 100 microl of MRS basal medium containing 2 mM @sm$ lactose @/sm$, l-fucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL), 3-fucosyllactose (3FL), 2',3-difucosyllactose (DFL), lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) or lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT). All the oligosaccharides were obtained from Biosynth Carbosynth (Compton, Berkshire, United Kingdom). Bacterial growth was tracked by measuring at 595 nm during 24 h at 37  C in 96-well plates in a POLARstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The growth of the isolated Bifidobacterium strains in the presence of @sm$ lactose @/sm$, l-fucose, galactose, GlcNAc, 2'FL, 3FL, DFL, LNT, LNnT, lacto-N-triose (LNTII), lacto-N-biose (LNB) or N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) at 2 mM was tested in MRS basal medium as previously described with some modifications.	2

The isolates were biochemically identified as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria or @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ and AMR was determined by the standard disk diffusion method. All isolates were resistant to cloxacillin, spiramycin and tilmicosin. High AMR frequencies (> 95%) were detected for tylosin, penicillin and sulfadiazine. AMR to danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, flumequine, ceftiofur, aminosidine, colistin, doxycycline, gentamicin, marbocyl and florfenicol was observed at low levels (< 10%). No AMR to cefquinome was found. Logistic regression showed several differences in antimicrobial activity between complexes. According to the source of aeromonads, only few differences in AMR between isolates from farmed and wild fish were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed an increasing trend of AMR to neomycin and apramycin among Aeromonas isolates during the study period, while resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline and thiamphenicol decreased. All isolates were multidrug resistance (MDR), but @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ showed the highest number of MDR per isolate. In most isolates, various degrees of MDR were detected to macrolides, @sm$ quinolones @/sm$, fluoroquinolones, polymyxins and cephalosporins (third and fourth generations), which are listed, by the World Health Organisation, to be among the highest priority and critically important antimicrobials in human medicine.	4
The left pars triangularis is commonly referred to as Broca's area and is a central area for speech production Members of the family Eggerthellaceae are able to convert the isoflavone @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ (a soy product) into equol, an estrogen. Specific members of this family, including Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Asaccharobacter celatus, and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$ all have negative associations with these same areas responsible for language circuits, in addition to areas of the brain responsible for memory, learning, and reward processing.	1
The level of Dopaquinone was causally related to the variation of PGLYRP4 (rs148195147, c.G602A, p.R201Q) and the abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ (Figure 5(b)). Also, the @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ is associated with the level of the @sm$ 2'-Deoxyguanosine @/sm$, a metabolite involved in the folate biosynthesis pathway.	0
The ligand is the @sm$ mannose @/sm$-capped lipoarabinomanan (LAM), absent from atypical mycobacteria. M. smegmatis, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M.	0
The ligand was prepared by refluxing benzalidene-4-iminoantipyrine with @sm$ tyrosine @/sm$. All the five complexes exhibited octahedral geometry with two NNO tridentate ligands binding to the metal center in a facial manner. All the compounds were duly characterized by analytical, spectral and microscopic methods. Biological analysis of ligand and complexes showed that complexes exhibit better antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity than the free ligand. Among the compounds tested, the manganese(II) complex 167 showed higher antibacterial activity against E. coli, @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$, S.	3
The limited number of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ antigens makes the identification of sialidase as a novel target of the human immune response notable. Like CT, @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ sialidase is secreted by a type II secretion system and interacts directly with the host enterocyte. @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ sialidase converts higher-order gangliosides into GM1, the receptor for CT, by removing @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ residues. The sialidase-encoding nanH gene is located on Vibrio pathogenicity island 2 (VPI2), a genomic island uniformly present in pathogenic @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ but typically absent in nonpathogenic Vibrio. While these features suggest a key role of the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ sialidase in the pathogenesis of cholera, sialidase was not shown to potentiate the effects of CT in a rabbit ileal loop model of cholera and had a modest effect on cholera pathogenesis in a suckling mouse model. These studies have led to speculation that sialidase may play a limited role in the pathogenesis of cholera. In our study, sialidase augmented CT responses in vitro, a potentiating effect that, importantly, could be fully neutralized by sialidase-specific human monoclonal antibodies. Thus, our findings support a role for @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ sialidase in host-pathogen interactions in human cholera.	1
The lipid A part of both LPSs contained 2,3-dideoxy-2,3-diamino-D-glucose as major constituents and @sm$ D-glucosamine @/sm$ and glycerol as minor constituents of the sugar backbone structure. Both LPSs exhibited a very complex fatty acid composition. Twenty amide-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids were detected in LPS of L. longbeachae, whereas seventeen were encountered in LPS of @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$. Both LPSs contained nine ester-linked nonhydroxy fatty acids and the unique long-chain fatty acids 27-oxo-octacosanoic acid, 29-oxo-triacontanoic acid, heptacosane-1,27-dioic acid and nonacosane-1, 29-dioic acid. SDS-PAGE showed that @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ produced smooth-form LPS, whereas L. longbeachae LPS was mainly of the R-type. Composition analyses were in accordance with these electrophoretic patterns. D-Quinovosamine and L-fucosamine constituted 80 mol% of the polysaccharide part of @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ LPS. Other sugars identified were @sm$ D-glucosamine @/sm$, D-mannose, D-glucose, L-rhamnose, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonic acid and glycerol.	1
The lowest resistances were to chloramphenicol, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, gentamicin and streptomycin (Table 4). In poultry, resistance to azithromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, nalidixic acid, and tilmicosin was significantly higher in @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ than Campylobacter jejuni (Table 4). The majority of the recovered turkey isolates (13/19) were resistant to more than 7 antimicrobials. Ge, et al. found that the most common resistantce in retail chicken and turkey was to tetracycline (82%), @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ (54%), nalidixic acid (41%) and ciprofloxacin (35%). Cui, et al. also found the highest resistance among chicken isolates to be to tetracycline (78%), followed by @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ (46%), and ciprofloxacin (8%) and that all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Ge, et al. found that turkey isolates showed significantly higher rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, nalidixic acid, and doxycycline than chicken isolates.	4
The main treatment approach is oral rehydration whenever possible, however intravenous fluids that include sodium, @sm$ potassium @/sm$, glucose and bicarbonate may be required in severe cases. A lactose free diet is recommended since Cryptosporidium destroys mature epithelial cells that are located in the villi resulting in loss of enzymes such as lactase. The disease is associated with high intestinal transit that may interfere with fluid, electrolyte, and drug absorption. Antimotility agents may be used once other causes of diarrhea such as @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ or dysentery are ruled-out.	0
The main-components of CS-EO were limonene, beta-myrcene, and @sm$ alpha-pinene @/sm$ (81.32%, 7.55%, and 4.20%) in prototype, compared to (60.23%, 5.33%, and 2.10%) in the conventional-method, respectively. The prototype CS-EO showed natural antibacterial-potentials, and inhibited the bio-film formation by Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, and E.	3
The major aetiological agents are Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ (@gm$ Tf @/gm$) and Treponema denticola (Td), the Gram-negative organisms in subgingival plaque biofilm., The destruction of the periodontal tissues is mainly due to the host defence against the dysbiotic biofilm. Among the major periodontal pathogens, Pg appears to be a keystone pathogen in the development of chronic periodontitis. Colonisation of the host tissues could only happen in the presence of virulence factors such as capsules, fimbriae, @sm$ LPS @/sm$, gingipains, outer membrane proteins and outer membrane vesicles.	1
The major virulence factors of @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ such as @sm$ LPS @/sm$, fimbriae, and gingipains facilitate colonization in the oral cavity. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with catechin (40 microM) inhibited the pro-IL-1beta expression induced by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ through the NF-kappaB, MAPK, and TLR signaling pathways.	3
The majority of patients received pembrolizumab with a platinum-based doublet of chemotherapy (one patient received atezolizumab combined with @sm$ paclitaxel @/sm$). The authors analysed the gut microbiome with 16S rRNA sequencing at baseline prior to ICI treatment. The baseline GM of healthy controls demonstrated higher alpha diversity than those with NSCLC. Specific bacterial species in abundance in the GM of patients who did not experience irAEs were @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (p = 0.001) and Desulfovibrio (p = 0.0002).	0
The mean @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$, fiber, protein, and fat intake was not significantly different between POMS and controls (Fig. 4). The ASVs with relative abundance significantly associated with different levels of macronutrients intake (p < 0.05, q > 0.2) are represented in Figure 5. The larger effects on relative abundance were associated with higher fiber intake driving lower relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae (ASV 66) and Methanobrevibacter (ASV 86) and higher abundances of Ruminoclostridium (ASV 62), Bacterioides uniformis (ASV 20), and Bifidobacterium (ASV 41). In addition to Ruminoclostridium (ASV 62), Ruminococcaceae (ASV 151) also belonged to the pink module and was associated with fiber intake levels, but with a less pronounced difference. Further ASVs associated with diet in the pink module included Subdoligranulum (ASV 8) and @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$ (ASV 58) both had higher relative abundances with higher fat and protein intake. From the purple module, only Dorea longicatena (ASV 22) abundance was associated with diet, slightly increasing with @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ consumption.	2
The meat curing processing involves using either nitrite and/or @sm$ nitrate salts @/sm$ to improve meat products' preservation due to the pronounced inhibitory effects of nitrite on anaerobic bacteria, namely @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$. Aside from acting as an antibotulinal agent, nitrite is also a strong oxidizer and is quickly transformed into nitric oxide, which reacts with the Fe3+ and Fe2+ of both myoglobin and metmyoglobin, respectively. It forms heat stable red-colored complexes, developing the appealing cherry-red color of cured meat, which consumers are used to. However, there has been a growing demand for healthy foods with fewer additives, especially curing salts that may lead to carcinogens formation. No replacement has yet been available on the market that may be capable to present both antimicrobial and color-forming effects in either raw or cooked meat products. Studies have been carried out to inhibit @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ genus bacteria in meat products without using any @sm$ nitrates @/sm$ and nitrites.	3
The mechanism of protection induced in mice against challenge with a virulent strain of @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ by porcine antiserum to the culture filtrate (CF) of an attenuated strain was investigated. Death and bacterial growth in the spleens of mice challenged with the virulent strain were completely prevented by treatment with the antiserum. The protective effect of the serum was markedly decreased in mice in which polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) were depleted by cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment but not in mice in which macrophages were blocked selectively by @sm$ carrageenan @/sm$ (@sm$ CG @/sm$). The phagocytic rate of PMN and the number of bacteria ingested by PMN were significantly higher in mice treated with the antiserum than in mice treated with normal serum. These results indicate that anti-CF serum exerts its protective effect by opsonic activity and that opsonized @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ are eliminated mainly by PMN.	3
The medium was composed of blood agar base n  2 (40 g/l) supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood (50 ml) (Oxoid, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), beef extract (3 g/l), Bacto-peptone (5 g/l), (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and spectinomycin (0.2 g/l), spiramycin (0.025 g/l), rifampicin (0.012 g/l) @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ (6.2 g/l), and colistin (6.25 mg/l) (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 810 ml distilled water. The plates were incubated for 4-7 days at 42 C in an anaerobic jar with CO2 produced by an AnaeroGen TM 3.5 L (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The colonies were examined by phase contrast microscopy (40x). The isolates were characterized by PCR using species-specific primers for nox (B. hyodysenteriae) and 16S rRNA (@gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$) as previously described (Casas et al.,) and stored at -80 C.	3
The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS supplemented with @sm$ Tween-20 @/sm$ (PBS-T, 0.1% @sm$ Tween-20 @/sm$). The membrane was probed with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T supplemented with rabbit antiserum raised against @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ FimA (1:200) protein, which is cross-reactive with SsaB.	0
The metagenomic data of SCAD patients showed higher abundance for genes involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ biosynthesis (PFDR = 3.01e-06), while lower abundance for genes in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (PFDR < 0.01) (Fig. S3 and 4). The major microbial contributors were Betaproteobacteria spp. (Ralstonia pickettii), Actinobacteria spp. (R. mucilaginosa, B. dentium), Bacteroidia spp. (Bacteroides clarus, Bacteroides massiliensis, Bacteroides nordii, @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$), Bacilli spp.	2
The mice in the @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$-treated group were given 200 muL of bacterial suspension via intragastric infusion each day, including the bacteriocin-producing @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ CCFM28 and CCFM18 strains, and non-bacteriocin-producing @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ NT17-3 and 102H8 strains. In contrast, 200 muL of physiological saline and @sm$ phenolphthalein @/sm$ (70 mg/kg body weight) were given to the negative and positive control groups, respectively.	0
The mice were provided drinking water containing 0.9 mug/L @sm$ formic acid @/sm$ throughout the challenge. Fecal pellets were collected 5 days post-gavage, and bacterial loads and CI were as before. A second group of Sm+/+ mice was treated similarly, but inoculated with the wild-type/mutant mixture and A. caccae Strr or @gm$ D. formicigenerans @/gm$ Strr.	0
The mice were then prepared for inoculation by the oral delivery of antibiotics (low aspartame-based sweetener added for good taste to mice) or water in the drinking water (1.0 g L-1 neomycin, 1.0 g L-1 ampicillin, 1.0 g L-1 metronidazole, and 0.5 g L-1 @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$) for 14 days. Such duration of 14 days antibiotic treatment was chosen based on bacteria absent (<1 CFU mg-1 in 107-fold dilutions) from feces aerobes (37 C for 48 h) and anaerobes (37 C for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber) incubation plated on blood agar medium. The antibiotic cocktail was freshly prepared every 36 h. After 14 days, all antibiotic-treated mice were randomly divided into five groups: the Antibiotic group (administrated water, n = 10); the K6 group (administered the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ strain K6 isolated from the feces of the control mice, n = 10); the Z5 group (administered the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ Z5 strain isolated from the feces of the AMO-treated mice, n = 10); the K6D group (7 days DSS treatment and then administered the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ strain K6 isolated from the feces of the control mice, n = 10); and the Z5D group (7 days DSS treatment and then administered the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ strain Z5 isolated from the feces of the AMO-treated mice, n = 10).	3
The microbes identified in our study have potential roles with respect to wheat such as productivity, health, components like carbon, nitrogen fixation, @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ solubilization, resistance to diseases, and so on. @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ is relatively more abundant in MW (2.7%) than in all other samples. It is an endophytic bacterium that benefit plants by their colonization and acts as a barrier against pathogenic microbes. It plays role in plant growth regulation through nitrogen fixation, siderophores, root growth, and @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ solubilization. Bacillus species like B. badius (Bur, 0.9%, and TCPF, 0.6%), B. firmus (Org, 3%; TCPF, 2.5%; Bur, 1.7%; and WAPC, 1.2%), B. flexus (highly expressed in Org [73%] and TCPF, WAPC, and TS [all 16%]; MW, 10.9%; and Bur, 4.9%), B. foraminis (Org, 5.7%; TS, 1.6%; TCPF, 1.4%; and WAPC, 0.8%), and B. selenatarsenatis (Bur, 2.9%; Org, 2.3%; and TCPF, 1.5%) expressed in the samples are described, along with their relative abundances. Apart from the above Bacillus species list, there are few species that were very specific to a single sample only, which may be of significant interest. They are B. cereus and B. horikoshii, which were expressed only in the MW (2.4%) and Bur (1%) samples, respectively. All these Bacillus species have wider roles in plant regulation like @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ solubilization, zinc and silicate solubilization, salt tolerance, siderophore, nitrogen fixation, as producers of phytohormones like cytokinin, as biofertilizers for micronutrients, and as biocontrol agents against pathogens.	1
The microbiological analysis consisted of the enumeration of total bacteria, total coliforms, Staphylococcus species, Salmonella species and @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$. Chicken litter from layers reared under intensive and free range systems showed lower mean total bacterial count than the litter collected from chicken broilers reared under either of the two systems (P=0.0291). The litter from intensive layers had the lowest mean total coliform counts (P=0.0222) while the lowest Staphylococcus species count was observed in the litter from free-range layers (P=0.0077). The @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ count was the lowest in chicken litter from intensively raised broilers and layers (P=0.0001). The chemical properties of litter from the different chicken types and production systems were compared based on determination of pH, electrical conductivity, carbon, nitrogen, @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$, potassium, cadmium and zinc. Litter from free-range broilers showed the highest pH value (P=0.0005); however, the electrical conductivity was higher in the litter from both intensive and free-range layers compared to the litter from both broiler production systems (P=0.0117). Chicken litter from intensive systems had higher nitrogen content than litter from free-range systems (P=0.0000). The total @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ was the lowest in free-range broiler litter (P=0.0001), while the total potassium was the lowest in litter from intensively managed broilers (P=0.0000).	0
The microbiota can produce @sm$ indoles @/sm$ by metabolizing tryptophan using the tryptophanase (TnaA) enzyme. Alternatively, @sm$ indoles @/sm$ can be synthesized via phenylalanine metabolism using phenylacetate dehydratase. Genetic variations in these enzymes lead to different @sm$ indoles @/sm$, such as indole-3-acetamide, indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptamine. Examples of bacteria that produce such indolic compounds include the @gm$ Peptostreptococcus @/gm$, Clostridium, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium species. Reductions in tryptophan to indole ratios in CRC patients are correlated with the reduced presence of Asaccharobacter, Parabacteroides, Fusicatenibacter, Anaerofilum, Clostridium XIVb and Anaerostipes. Additionally, it has been shown that @gm$ Peptostreptococcus @/gm$ is a key producer of indoleacrylic acid and indole-3-propionic acid.	1
The microbiota, especially Bacteroidetes, are believed to complement eukaryotic genomes with degradation enzymes targeting resistant dietary polymers, such as plant cell wall compounds (e.g., cellulose, @sm$ pectin @/sm$, and xylan), and phylum Bacteroidetes possessed the highest potential of fiber degradation compared to other phyla. In the present study, we noted that P. jiangxiensis, C. fastidiosus, B. coprocola CAG:162, B. barnesiae, and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ (five members belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes) expressed the largest number of GH-encoding genes and had the largest number of GH families in DGS.	2
The mineral composition of the finished product, expressed in parts per million, was @sm$ calcium @/sm$, 150; phosphorus, 157; magnesium, 43; potassium, 1166; sodium, 286; iron, 17; copper, 8; and zinc, 3.4. @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, Salmonella dublin, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae grew well when they were inoculated into unacidified, hydrolyzed permeate.	0
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, rifampin, amikacin, clindamycin, fosfomycin, PEN, MEM, LNZ, @sm$ VAN @/sm$, and TMP/SMX were determined by agar dilution method, and the susceptibility to tigecycline and daptomycin was tested by the broth dilution according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. The control strain @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ ATCC 49619 was included. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoint recommendations were chosen for erythromycin, PEN, MEM, @sm$ VAN @/sm$, and TMP/SMX.	3
The model shows that oxalate is likely to be absorbed in the stomach, although it can be also absorbed in the small intestine, particularly at the distal end (after the absorption of calcium), and in the colon, since, on a normal intake of calcium and phosphate, most of the calcium in the large bowel would be anticipated to be precipitated as @sm$ calcium phosphate @/sm$ under the prevailing alkaline conditions and high concentration of phosphate. The amount of free oxalate in the colon is also controlled by the presence or absence of @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$, an anaerobe that has an obligate requirement for oxalate as a source of energy and cellular carbon.	2
The modified actin distribution was shown to reduce internalization of Bordetella pertussis, @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella hadar in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/ml. The magnitude of reduction at a PMA concentration of 1,000 ng/ml was greater than the reduction elicited by @sm$ cytochalasin B @/sm$ at 2.5 micrograms/ml but was less than that elicited by cytochalasin D at 2.5 micrograms/ml.	3
The monocytes were cultured with the @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ (BEI Resources) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. pyogenes (Sigma) in the presence of @sm$ cocaine @/sm$ (Sigma) for 48 hours. The final concentration of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, LTA from S. pyogenes, and @sm$ cocaine @/sm$ were 1.25 x 106 bacterial cells/mL, 1.25 x 106 bacterial cells/mL, and 1 muM, respectively. The dose of @sm$ cocaine @/sm$ was used based on a previous study.	3
The most common facultative isolates were Klebsiella oxytoca, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ and Enterobacter agglomerans. Treatment of E. posticus with metronidazole caused a dedifferentiation of the different regions of the hindgut. One region of the hindgut is characterized by its visibly black color, a unique microbiota, and electron dense deposits in electron micrographs. Chemical determinations showed high concentrations of ferrous and sulfide ions in the region. X-ray microprobe analysis showed that some of the electron dense deposits consisted of iron, sulfur and lower amounts of @sm$ copper @/sm$, aluminium, and chromium associated with ruthenium red staining material.	0
The most common organic acids found in the fermentation broth include lactic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$, and propionic acid in the case of L. plantarum and @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ strains.	1
The most commonly used microorganisms in probiotics are @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$-producing bacteria belonging to the Lactobacillus and Bifibacterium species, bacillus strains and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Enterococcus bacteria, more precisely Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, are also commonly used as probiotics. @sm$ Lactic acid @/sm$-producing bacteria, or LAB, complexes are often produced as probiotic blends and can comprise various genera of LAB such as Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, and Streptococcus. Bacillus strains are not referred to as LAB, but several Bacillus species have a strong capacity to produce @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$.	1
The most frequent etiologic organism was @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$ (91%). CIP was empirically used as initial treatment regimen in 33% of 334 patients. The third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or @sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$) was used in 40.4%.	0
The most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial species between the adenoid surface and core. The above common bacteria were more sensitive to cephalosporins and @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ antibiotics, and significantly resistant to penicillin antibiotics and non-beta-lactamase inhibitors.	3
The mucin protein is heavily O-glycosylated and has multiple structures of repeating alpha- and beta-linked N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and galactose (Gal) residues, terminated with alpha-linked fucose (Fuc), and @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ (Neu5Ac) residues. Mucus-degrading bacteria harbor specific glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) that enzymatically degrade mucin glycans. After cleavage, the released glycan oligosaccharides can feed the bacteria or other microbes in the vicinity. In order to degrade mucin glycans, intestinal bacteria must possess GH33 sialidases (also known as neuraminidases), which cleave terminal @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ residues. For efficient glycan cleavage, bacteria can also generate GH29 or GH95 to remove fucose residues. Once the terminal sugars are removed, the underlying GalNAc, GlcNAc, and galactose residues can be removed. Bacteria can have GH101 or GH129 to remove GalNAc, GH84, GH85, GH89, or GH20 to remove GlcNAc, or GH2, GH35, GH42, and GH98 to remove galactose residues. Some bacteria also encode for GH16, endo-acting O-glycanases that remove larger glycan structures. A recent genome analysis confirmed that B. bifidum harbored the largest repertoire of mucus-degrading GHs among the Bifidobacterium species. All B. bifidum genomes had GH33, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH42, GH101, GH129, GH89, and GH84, suggesting that this species was capable of cleaving @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$, fucose, GalNAc, GlcNAc, and galactose from mucus glycans. B. breve, B. longum, and B. scardovii were also found to possess multiple mucus-associated GHs. This finding is consistent with other genome studies and in vitro studies, which report that B. bifidum, B. longum, and B. breve can degrade mucus. In contrast, B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. animalis, B. dentium, B. pseudolongum, and @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ possessed few mucus-associated GHs.	2
The multienzyme complexes system can efficiently degrade @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ or resistant starch by interacting with dockerins and cohesins domains. This system has been found in @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ in human feces; dockerin is a small domain found in enzyme components and cohesin is a beta-sandwich domain found in non-catalytic scaffold proteins that provides carbohydrate binding and/or cell wall anchoring functions. These findings show that at least some Firmicutes in the microbiome have evolved to use @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ in the human gut.	2
The mycolic acids give mycobacteria a @sm$ lipid @/sm$-rich Raman spectral profile, a feature that has been reported for 26 mycobacterial species (including @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$) and used to distinguish mycobacteria from other bacterial genera. To further characterize the infection, we inspected the mycobacterial lesions using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4b). This ultrastructural analysis revealed clustered, intracellular mycobacteria containing a number of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ droplets, a feature that is typical of mycobacteria during infection.	0
The nan cluster of @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$, a food-borne pathogen, consists of two divergently transcribed operons, nanT(PSL)AR and nanEK nagA, required for transport and catabolism of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A mutation of nanR abolished the extensive lag phase observed for the bacteria growing on Neu5Ac and increased transcription of nanT(P) and nanE, suggesting that NanR is a transcriptional repressor of both nan operons. Intracellular accumulation of Neu5Ac was dependent on the @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source, implying that the nan operons are also subject to catabolite repression. Hence, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) appeared to activate and repress transcription of nanT(PSL)AR and nanEK nagA, respectively. Direct bindings of NanR and CRP to the nanT(P)-nanE intergenic DNA were demonstrated by EMSA. Two adjacent NanR-binding sites centered at +44.5 and -10 and a CRP-binding site centered at -60.5 from the transcription start site of nanT(P) were identified by DNase I protection assays. Mutagenesis approaches, in vitro transcription, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate specifically binds to NanR and functions as the inducer of the nan operons. The combined results propose a model in which NanR, CRP, and N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate cooperate for precise adjustment of the expression level of the @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ nan cluster.	2
The natural susceptibility of 54 @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$-like strains of Y. bercovieri (formerly @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ biovar 3B, n = 17), Y. mollaretii (formerly @gm$ Y enterocolitica @/gm$ biovar 3A, n = 12), Y. aldovae (formerly @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$-like group chi2, n = 10) and 'Y ruckeri' (n = 15) was tested to 69 antibiotics. MIC values were determined with a microdilution procedure in IsoSensitest broth for all strains and in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth for some strains. All yersiniae tested showed uniform MIC distributions to most antibiotics and were naturally sensitive or intermediate to aminoglycosides, several cephalosporins, and penicillins, carbapenems, @sm$ aztreonam @/sm$, quinolones, tetracyclines, antifolates, chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin, and naturally resistant to benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, all macrolides except azithromycin, lincosamides, streptogramins, glycopeptides, rifampicin and fusidic acid.	3
The new isolate produced a low content of lactic acid of 0.5 g/L in overnight culture, while @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production was approximately 0.28 g/L. During the production of organic acids, the pH in the fermentation broth gradually decreased to 3.51 +- 0.02 in the first 2 days of biofilm development and it was constant during 7 days biofilm maturation. Interestingly, pH values lower than those in the control were found in the first 2 days of exposing Lb. plantarum PA21 biofilm to all of the above-mentioned pathogens except @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$.	1
The nine human gut commensals that encode the Nan cluster include @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, Dorea formicigenerans, D. longicatena, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Ruminococcus gnavus, Lactobacillus sakei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius. Thus, the majority of the bacteria that encode the Nan cluster colonize mucous regions of the human body, such as the gut, lung, bladder, or oral cavity, where sialic acid is highly abundant and it can serve as a source of energy, @sm$ carbon @/sm$, and nitrogen.	2
The objective of this study was to develop a novel @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production mode by coupling dark and photo-fermentation to take full advantage of the complementary capabilities of DFB and PFB and reduce operating costs. The kinetic characteristics of growth and @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production of the DFB, @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ harbinese B49, and the PFB, Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53, were determined. Based on the kinetics of DFB and PFB, we designed a novel integrated dark and photo-fermentative reactor (IDPFR). The @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ production of this novel reactor was also investigated under different operating conditions.	1
The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the combination of the photosensitizers (PSs) erythrosine/@sm$ methylene blue @/sm$ activated by a white halogen light device on Streptococcus mutans biofilm. METHODS: Two separate experiments were conducted, the first using the PSs at the concentration of 100 muM, and the second 250 muM. The PSs were tested on @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ biofilms cultured for 24 h in isolation, in combination, with and without light activation for 2 min fractionated in 4 periods of 30 s. After treatment, biofilms were diluted and plated on BHI medium and incubated for 24 h for colony forming units (CFU) counting. The results (log10) were analyzed with ANOVA followed by Tukey test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The erythrosine/@sm$ methylene blue @/sm$ combination activated by white halogen light at 100 and 250 muM, and erythrosine at 250 muM, @sm$ methylene blue @/sm$ at 250 muM presented significantly reduced cell counts (3.2 log10, 5.3 log10, 4.5 log10, 4.3 log10, respectively) when compared to controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PDT with the combination of erythrosine/@sm$ methylene blue @/sm$ demonstrated better results that the PSs in isolation regardless of the concentration.	3
The obtained suspension (addition of 0.9% NaCl solution (1 ml/mg of biofilm) was diluted in decimal series and inoculated in triplicate in blood agar culture media to determine total microorganisms (TM), and MSKB (90 g mitis salivarius dehydrated agar; 1 ml 1% potassium tellurite; 20% w/v @sm$ sorbitol @/sm$; 1ug/ml kanamycin monosulfate; 0.1 U/ml bacitracin) for counting @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ and Man Rogosa Sharpe agar for counting Lactobacillus acidophilus (kept for 48 h in an oven at 37  C with a partial pressure of 5% CO2) for 48 h, the ratio of colony forming units (CFU) per milligram of biofilm was established (CFU/mg).	2
The other dominant genera for L-conditioning tests were @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ (class Clostridia, ~2.3%) and Acetoanaerobium (class Bacilli, ~5.3%), which can, respectively, ferment several kinds of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides to form HAc and produce HAc from @sm$ H2 @/sm$ and CO2.	2
The other way to produce VFCs, such as benzene acetaldehyde and @sm$ benzaldehyde @/sm$, is through the action of decarboxylase, which finally forms ester compounds such as ethyl phenylethyl ester. Studies have shown that L. lactis, @gm$ L. delbrueckii @/gm$ and Streptococcus thermophilus produce decarboxylase to decompose tyrosine to produce tyramine and aldehydes.	1
The pathways also included triglyceride and glycoprotein degradation and conversion of @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ and glutamate degradation, both leading to crotonyl-CoA, a possible precursor of butyrate metabolism (online supplementary table 7). Although only 6% variation was observed after 8 weeks, enrichment in glutamate degradation to crotonyl-CoA was maintained in the MedD group. This pathway was significantly linked to the levels of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ msp_0388 (Spearman's rho=0.73, p<10e-6, online supplementary figure 30).	2
"The patterns of Prevotella and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ in prediabetes and T2D are highly inconsistent across cohorts as shown in our and other studies. Higher abundance of P. copri in the gut microbiota has been suggested to be both conducive and detrimental to @sm$ glucose @/sm$ homeostasis and host metabolism in different studies, and its role in human health is still under investigation. Tett et al. found no association between the prevalence and abundance of the four P. copri clades and the etiology of several diseases, including T2D. However, the two cohorts of T2D included in the Tett et al.'s study are from the Chinese and European populations that generally have low prevalence of P. copri dominated by clade A. Therefore, the potential clade-specific effects of P. copri in T2D require further investigation in Prevotella-rich populations with non-Westernized P. copri clades using metagenomic sequencing. Additionally, we propose a scenario where some of the observed microbiota signatures in Pakistani T2D patients, namely the reduction in Prevotella and expansion in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and butyrate production capacity, are reflective of their transitioning gut microbial ecosystem toward the industrialized one. Supporting this, the microbiota profiling of non-industrialized/non-urbanized African communities suggests a different ecological layout supporting SCFA production with little or no contribution from @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and typical butyrate producers, corresponding to their ""high-propionate and low-butyrate"" SCFA profile. In general, the effects of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and butyrate in promoting human health have been understudied in non-Western populations, where human-microbe associations may need to be interpreted in an entirely different context."	0
The pellet was observed by scanning electron microscopy and FISH in the presence of a pure culture of @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ strain VD9 (demonstrated to be nanoarchaea-free by PCR) used as a nanoarchaea negative control, using methods above described. After observation of pelleted methanogens and nanoarchaea, the pellet was deglycosylated as described above prior to its inoculation in SAB medium supplemented with a vitamin cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, Merck) (SI Appendix, Table S2), 0.1 g @sm$ D-fructose @/sm$ (Sigma Aldrich), a fatty acid mixture (1 mL of a solution of isobutyric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid) (Sigma Aldrich) and 5% of 0.22 microm-filtered bovine rumen.	2
The pellets consisting of the cell membrane fractions were resuspended into 10 mL of the same @sm$ glycan @/sm$ containing media and incubated in the anaerobic chamber at 37 C for 16 hr. The cell membrane treated @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media as well as the respective fresh @sm$ glycan @/sm$ containing media were filtered with 0.2 mum filter (Whatman). Butyrate producers were grown in ABB (AC, CC and ER) or BHI (@gm$ RI @/gm$) at 37 C anaerobically for 16-24 hr, and passaged in the same media with a dilution of 20-fold until they reached exponential phase (OD600~1.0). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,200 x g for 10 min and washed with DM29 and resuspended in DM29 to an OD600 of approximately 1. Cultures were then inoculated into fresh media supplemented with different @sm$ glycans @/sm$ and cell membrane treated @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media to an initial OD600 of 0.05 and incubated at 37  C without shaking in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One).	2
The permease and ATPase subunits (Wzm and Wzt) are encoded by the first two ORFs of the OAg locus and are closely related to enzymes encoded by @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ biosynthesis gene clusters in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, also members of the Pasteurellaceae family. Modal chain length regulation in ABC transporter dependent OAg systems is poorly understood; in some E. coli serotypes, chain termination and transport occurs upon methylation of the terminal sugar. No methylated sugars were found in the @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ 13 OAg by structural analysis (Twelkmeyer et al., manuscript in preparation) and none of the proteins encoded by its OAg locus is predicted to contain the coiled coil motif that is typical of methyltransferases, suggesting that the tight OAg chain length distribution in this strain is controlled by a different mechanism. Following the ABC transporter nucleotide-binding domain classification scheme of, the @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ strain 13 Wzt protein falls into phylogenetic group D. Members of this group lack C-terminal extensions and the @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ that they transport do not typically contain chain-terminating modifications.	1
The phyto-pharmaceutical products based on Geranium sps., Mentha sps, Ocinum sps., Matricaria sps., Salvia sps., Lavandula @gm$ sps @/gm$., and Rosmarinus sps. are widespread, and the plants are based from organic crops. Janvi Pandey reported that certain medicinal plants are very good @sm$ Cd @/sm$, Pb, Zn, and Cr accumulators.	0
The polar lipids were found to be @sm$ diphosphatidylglycerol @/sm$, phosphatidylglycerol and four unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content of strain CAT-2(T) was 68.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities showed that strain CAT-2(T) belongs to the genus Gordonibacter, sharing the highest level of sequence homology with @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$ @gm$ DSM 19378 @/gm$(T) (97.3 %).	0
The polyphosphate glucokinases can phosphorylate @sm$ glucose @/sm$ to glucose 6-phosphate using polyphosphate as the substrate. ORF all1371 encodes a putative polyphosphate glucokinase in the filamentous heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Here, ORF all1371 was heterologously expressed in @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, and its purified product was characterized. Enzyme activity assays revealed that All1371 is an active polyphosphate glucokinase that can phosphorylate both @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and mannose in the presence of divalent cations in vitro. Unlike many other polyphosphate glucokinases, for which nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP or GTP) act as phosphoryl group donors, All1371 required polyphosphate to confer its enzymic activity. The enzymic reaction catalysed by All1371 followed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with kcat = 48.2 s(-1) at pH 7.5 and 28  C and KM = 1.76 microM and 0.118 mM for polyphosphate and @sm$ glucose @/sm$, respectively.	2
The possible use of combinations of LAB strains (@gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ LUHS183 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides LUHS242, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ LUHS183 and Lactobacillus brevis LUHS173, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ LUHS183 and Enterococcus pseudoavium LUHS234, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ LUHS183 and Lactobacillus curvatus LUHS51, Lactobacillus plantarum LUHS135 and L. curvatus LUHS51, L. plantarum LUHS135 and @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ LUHS183) isolated and characterised from spontaneously fermented wheat sourdough for the preparation of wheat sourdough has been reported, and prepared sourdoughs were tested for wheat bread production. Most of the tested LAB starters possessed versatile carbohydrate metabolism, and most of them were able to ferment L-arabinose, @sm$ D-ribose @/sm$, D-galactose, D-fructose, and D-maltose. Additionally, most of the selected LAB starters showed high tolerance to acidic conditions (high viability at pH 2.5 for 2 h). This characteristic is very important to ensure sourdough stability during processing. Different LAB combinations led to different bread sensory properties, and the highest overall acceptability was shown for bread samples prepared with sourdough fermented with the L. plantarum and @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ combination. Despite this sourdough starter combination increasing the specific volume and porosity of bread samples, the lowest acrylamide concentration was found in bread fermented with the @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ and L.	2
The potential for either d-lactate or @sm$ l-lactate @/sm$ production via lactate dehydrogenase (K00016, K03778) was detected in 55.3% of the MAGs. Genes for the production of both enantiomers of @sm$ lactate @/sm$ were carried by 172 MAGs and over half (n = 92) of these were members of the @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ genus or Lachnospiraceae or Lactobacillaceae families.	1
The prebiotic action of @sm$ (poly)phenols @/sm$ on the gut microbiota may directly stem from the activation of PAZymes like tannase, quercetinase (family of cupin-type dioxygenases: flavonol 2,4-dioxygenase, quercetin 2,3-dioxygenases), gallate decarboxylase, esterase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase enzymes, leading to both the generation of bioaccessible phenolic metabolites and microbial cross-feeding interactions in the gut. @sm$ (Poly)phenol @/sm$-rich powders and high molecular-weight polymeric fractions significantly increased the proportion of Eggerthellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae families (i.e., Adlercreutzia equolifaciens) in the gut microbiota of humans and animals, two families displaying unique ability to break down @sm$ (poly)phenols @/sm$ and transform them into trophic growth factors. Among the species belonging to these families, @gm$ Gordonibacter @/gm$ spp., Eggerthella lenta, and A. equolifaciens have been identified as @sm$ (poly)phenols @/sm$-degrading gut bacteria. These species are known to metabolize ellagic acid and flavan-3-ols and have the capacity to cleave the C-ring of all (epi)catechin stereoisomers and other derivatives. Similarly, the growth-promoting activity of blueberry @sm$ (poly)phenols @/sm$ on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli strains has been linked to their @sm$ (poly)phenol @/sm$-metabolizing abilities.	2
The predominant SCFAs derived from bacterial fermentation are acetate, propionate and butyrate (3:1:1 ratio), which can be oxidized to feed the intracellular @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ pool and histone acetylation. The fluctuation in the fermentation products is dependent on the fiber source and bacterial pathways dictated by microbial community composition of the intestine. The most investigated SCFA in this matter is butyrate synthetized by butyrate-forming bacteria from butyryl-CoA through butyryl-phosphate or using various transferases, with one of them using exogenous acetate. Duncan et al. showed that while Faecalibacterium prausnitizii and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp.	1
The presence of cca in the ypjD operon, along with bshA and bshB1 suggests the intriguing possibility that CCAase may be involved in the response of @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ to oxidative stress. Evidence supporting this possibility was recently presented by Cruz Hernandez et al.. In that study, @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ was subjected to oxidative stress generated by exposure to mercury, and the integrity of six tRNAs was then examined by electrophoretic mobility on Northern blots, finding that mercury exposure had no effect on the mobility of five of the six tRNAs, i.e., those for alanine, @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$, valine, leucine, and threonine.	3
The presence of lactic acid is key to a healthy homeostasis of the vagina and its production comes from two different sources: by the vaginal epithelium (mainly L-lactate representing 20% of the total lactic acid) and by the microbiota, responsible for metabolizing approximately 80% of @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ producing the two isoforms of lactic acid with a predominance of D-lactic acid. When the squamous epithelium requires energy in the form of ATP, the @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ from the vaginal epithelial cells is converted to glucose, then to pyruvate, and from this to lactic acid, which is released into the vaginal lumen as the epithelium undergoes desquamation. This production of lactic acid is performed under the control of the estrogen levels present in the blood, as these promote maturation and deposition in the vaginal epithelial cells. Therefore, due to the known change in estrogens production throughout the woman's life cycle, the vaginal ecosystem can be subjected to modifications. The second and main mechanism for producing lactic acid comes from the @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ found in the vaginal lumen, which is catabolized by alpha amylases to produce maltose, maltotriose and alpha dextrins, which are subsequently converted into lactic acid, due to the action of the @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$-stimulated lactic dehydrogenase.	2
The present clinical trial has been carried out in order to evaluate the efficacy of @sm$ benzydamine @/sm$ in treatment of vaginitis caused by @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$. Fifty women affected by this specific pathology have been submitted to topical treatment with 0.5% @sm$ benzydamine @/sm$ vaginal cream. The treatment has been carried out for 9 consecutive days using a local application of @sm$ benzydamine @/sm$ twice a day. The clinical result was evaluated after 12 and 60 days. The following parameters were taken into consideration: symptoms (leucorrhea, itching, burning), clinical signs (oedema, hyperemia, vaginal secretion), instrumental data (pH, colposcopy, sniff test) and microbiological findings (searching of clue cells, Lactobacillus and @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$). At the first check point after 12 days 84% of patients have been considered healed; at the second check the percentage of healing rose to 92%. Therefore @sm$ benzydamine @/sm$ was considered highly effective in 92% of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis.	3
The present experiments revealed that @sm$ NADH @/sm$ consumption by PH and ToMO is retarded in the absence of the regulatory protein when hydrocarbon substrate is not present (Table 2). Similar studies have been reported for sMMO. These results implicate the regulatory protein in the ET process, although the molecular details of this process are not understood. X-ray crystal structures of hydroxylase/regulatory protein complexes from Pseudomonas sp. OX1 PH and @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ KR1 T4mo show that the regulatory protein binds to the hydroxylase at the proposed docking site of the cognate electron-transfer protein.	3
The primary members within the complex microbiota that were directly involved in GOS fermentation were shown to be @gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$, B. bifidum, B. catenulatum, Lactobacillus gasseri, and L. salivarius, in line with the prebiotic effect of GOS, although some other species incorporated (13)C label also. GOS fermentation led to an increase in @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (+49%) and lactate (+23%) compared with the control.	1
The principal infection exhibiting this structural similarity is @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$, which displays mimics of GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and other gangliosides on its surface lipo-oligosaccharide. Autoantibodies thus induced bind @sm$ glycan @/sm$ epitopes on peripheral nerve gangliosides where they activate complement and recruit macrophages, causing structural and functional disorganization of nerve conduction.	3
The principal products of endogenous metabolism of the obligate anaerobe @gm$ Peptococcus prevotii @/gm$ were carbon dioxide, ammonia, @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate, which are also produced by fermentation of nucleosides, purines and ribose, thus supporting our previous finding that RNA is the only cellular component to undergo substantial degradation under starvation conditions. Minor products were hydrogen, formate and propionate. The stoicheiometries of fermentation of xanthine, adenine, adenosine and ribose were determined. The ability to ferment exogenous nucleosides, purines and ribose declined rapidly on starvation, as did the ability to generate ATP from xanthine, and was paralleled by the loss of viability. However, addition of pulses of xanthine or adenine to organisms in the early stages of starvation sustained their adenylate energy charge and prolonged their viability. Evidence suggests that @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$ dies when its principal energy source (RNA) is depleted, and a possible explanation is that the transport function of the cytoplasmic membrane decays rapidly under these conditions so that, on transfer to a recovery medium, uptake of nutrients is inadequate to support growth.	1
The production of 2-methylpropanal, 2-methylbutanal, and @sm$ 3-methylbutanal @/sm$ is respectively due to the transamination of valine, isoleucine, and leucine, while the transamination reaction in which the substrate is represented by aspartic acid, is responsible for the release of oxaloacetate, which is in turn further converted into acetoin, diacetyl, or 2,3-butanediol. Recently, the pivotal role of the aspartic acid transamination was demonstrated in the production of diacetyl in Lactobacillus paracasei. Previously, in @gm$ Lactococcus lactis var @/gm$.	1
The production of @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and propionate was consistently increased with supplementation across all donors. Levels of butyrate production were not apparently affected by NUTRIOSE  supplementation. A preclinical study of NUTRIOSE  supplementation in rats demonstrated increased production of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate with supplementation versus without. The difference in butyrate production between these studies may be explained by the different experimental methods. Both propionate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ have beneficial effects on the host. Propionate alters inflammatory gene expression in colonic epithelial cells, downregulating IL-8 and MCP-1 expression and potentially contributing to local containment of immune responses. Additionally, it is well established that propionate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ promote gut barrier function and intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and that SCFAs induce the expression of tight junction proteins, including occludin. The enrichment of succinate- (an intermediate metabolite in propionate synthesis), @sm$ acetate @/sm$-, propionate-, and/or butyrate-producing bacterial species, including P. distasonis, @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$, and members of the Bacteroidetes phylum with NUTRIOSE  supplementation supports the metabolic findings. Indeed, metabolite-taxa correlation analysis demonstrated a link between @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production and the enrichment of the strictly anaerobic Blautia and Parabacteroides genera, and between propionate production and the enrichment of the Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ genera.	1
The production of compounds in the internal part of these cheeses evolved over time from 24h to 8 days, with an increase in the levels of compounds such as 2-methyl propanal, 2,3-butanedione, 3-methyl butanol, and @sm$ dimethyl sulfide @/sm$. This last was observed inside cheeses, although in many cases, these levels were comparable to those induced by strains of other species of enterobacteria such as Serratia liquefaciens, @gm$ Enterobacter sakazakii @/gm$, E.	1
The proposed strategy combines the main elements of the two approaches through the covalent binding of the @sm$ PS @/sm$ to the Poly (as a cationic agent), which can alter the organization of the bacterial outer membrane (Table 4). The antimicrobial outcomes of both conjugates displayed a high efficiency in MRSA killing. Later, the same group repeated the conjugates as PSs on solid media of bacteria irradiated by a 630 nm LED. Both were accumulated in significant amounts by Prevotella intermedia, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, but not by Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, as final conclusions, Lauro and co-workers deliberated that aPDT based on GlamTMPn-Poly exhibited a higher affinity for bacterial cells. In 2017, Chen et al. used a fabric coated with a epsilon-polylysine (EPL) to introduce a second layer of a metallophthalocyanine, the zinc(II) complex of a mono-substituted beta-carboxyphthalocyanine (CPZ). The complex obtained, named as Fabric-EPL-CPZ was tested as @sm$ PS @/sm$ against drug-resistant bacteria with a pre-incubation period of 10 min.	3
The protective effects of Caulis Spatholobi polysaccharide (CSP) on immune function, intestinal mucosal barrier, and intestinal microflora in @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$ (@sm$ CY @/sm$)-induced immunosuppressed chickens have been rarely reported. This study was designed to investigate the cecal microbiota in chickens and to elucidate the immune mechanism involved in the CSP effect on @sm$ CY @/sm$ induced-immunosuppressed chickens. A total of 288 cocks were equally divided into six groups and used to evaluate the immune effect of CSP. Results showed that the CSP increased the body weight and immune organ index of immunosuppressed chickens, significantly increased the secretion of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) in sera of chickens, and restored the body immune function. The CSP reduced intestinal injury of the jejunum and ileum, increased the ratio of the intestinal villus height to crypt depth (V/C), improved the expression of tight junction protein, and protected intestinal health. The CSP activated the toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway and enhanced the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-kappaB, Claudin1, and Zo-1, protecting the intestinal tract. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that CSP increased species richness, restored @sm$ CY @/sm$-induced intestinal microbiome imbalance, and enhanced the abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in the intestinal tract.	3
The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in poultry carcasses at slaughter in Poland. For the isolated strains, resistance to selected antibiotics and the associated genetic determinants were identified. A total of 498 @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ isolates were obtained from 802 poultry samples during the 2-year study period. Strains were identified to species with the PCR method; 53.6% of the strains were Campylobacter jejuni and 46.4% were @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$. A high percentage of the tested @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (74.1 and 73.5%, respectively) followed by @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (47.4%) and streptomycin (20.5%). Only one C. jejuni and two @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Seventy-nine (15.9%) of the 498 strains were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics examined. Higher levels of resistance, irrespective of the antimicrobial agent tested, were found within the @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ group. Almost all strains resistant to quinolones (99.5%) and to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (99.6%) carried the Thr-86-to-Ile mutation in the gyrA gene and possessed the tet(O) marker, respectively. All isolates resistant to erythromycin had the A2075G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. These results reveal that poultry carcasses in Poland are a reservoir of potentially pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ strains for humans, which may pose a public health risk.	4
The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$-like material in the intestinal spirochaete @gm$ Serpulina pilosicoli @/gm$ and the extent of antigenic cross-reactivity of this material in different strains of the species. Hot water-phenol, aqueous-phase extracts from five porcine and three human strains of @gm$ S. pilosicoli @/gm$, and from seven strains of four other Serpulina spp., were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained profiles were obtained. All @gm$ S. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains had a predominant band at c. 16 kDa. Some also had a partial ladder-like profile, consistent with the presence of semi-rough lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS); this was more obvious in Western immunoblot analysis. LOS from each @gm$ S. pilosicoli @/gm$ strain was serologically distinct in immunoblot analysis and there was no cross-reactivity with other Serpulina spp. The serological diversity found amongst the LOS of @gm$ S. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains may help to explain why individual people and animals can suffer repeated infections with different strains of the organism.	1
The putative ethanol-H2-coproducing bacteria comprised 11 novel phylotypes closely related to @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$, Clostridium thermocellum, and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum. Furthermore, analysis of the alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzyme also pointed to an @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$-like organism, which is known to have a high conversion rate of carbohydrate to H2 and ethanol. We also found six novel HPB that were associated with @sm$ lactate @/sm$-, propionate-, and butyrate-oxidizing bacteria in the acidophilic H2-producing sludge.	1
The reasons as-yet-uncultured bacteria remain unclear are speculated to include the following: (i) anaerobic culture techniques require special training for investigators 25, 26; (ii) most of the microorganisms in the human intestinal tract are highly @sm$ oxygen @/sm$-sensitive anaerobes 27, 28, 29; and (iii) multiple interbacterial communications exist in the gut microbiota. Ohno et al. 30 reported that the growth of Symbiobacterium thermophilum is accelerated by the addition of supernatants from Bacillus cultures. Watanabe et al. 31 reported that the growth of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ spp.	3
The relative abundance of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Acinetobacter, Alloprevotella, Howardella, and Oxalobacter were enriched by EPS-m2 compared with another two groups (Figure 4). Previous studies have suggested that @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ are involved in the fermentation of polysaccharides; for example, Alistipes putredinis could degrade fiber and glucosinolates and @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ was involved in the metabolism of glycans. In this study, the genus @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ was significantly increased after EPS-m2 treatment at 24 and 72 h. The more abundant @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ might be linked to EPS-m2 degradation in the human intestine. It has been reported that Acinetobacter can degrade and use benzyl alcohol, black liquor, and kraft lignin as carbon sources. However, there is no report that Acinetobacter was related to degrading bacterial polysaccharides. Fermentation in vitro revealed that @sm$ fucoidan @/sm$ modulates gut microbiota and an increased abundance of Alloprevotella. Also, the abundance of genera Alloprevotella increased during in vitro fermentation of bee-collected pollen of Chinese wolfberry. Recently, studies have revealed that the high-fiber group is associated with increased abundances of Oxalobacter compared with the low-fiber group. However, there is no report that Howardella is enriched by EPSs before. It has been well-characterized that different resources of polysaccharides have different chemical structures, which might influence the profiles of populations and metabolites of bacterial groups. Although EPS-m2 and EPS-RB share a similar monosaccharide composition, their molecular proportion is significantly different and, given their different chemical structures, they are proposed to exert diverse functions. As expected, the fermentation of EPS-m2 enriched the microbiota of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Acinetobacter, Alloprevotella, Howardella, and Oxalobacter compared with Collinsella, Butyricimonas, and Hafnia for EPS-RB.	2
"The relative abundance of Weissneria and @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$ increased, and they gradually became the dominant microorganisms. This was similar to the results of ""three-phase evolution,"" which has been discussed in recent studies. Regardless of the type of flour, naturally fermented sourdoughs go through three stages in the fermentation process, which were comprised of ""the three-phase evolution."" They are (i) dominance of LAB species belonging to the genera Enterococcus, @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$, and Leuconostoc; (ii) increasingly important presence of sourdough-specific LAB, such as Pediococcus and Weissella; and (iii) dominance of well-adapted sourdough strains, including heterofermentative species. The microbial community changes of LAB were mainly related to the degree of microbial tolerance to acidic environments and the way the microorganisms used @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ and nitrogen sources in the fermentation substrate."	2
The relative abundance of fiber consuming and beneficial microbes including Prevotella (@gm$ P. dentalis @/gm$, P. enoeca, P. oris, P. meloninogenica), Bifidobacterium bifidum, and a @sm$ sulfur @/sm$ reducer Desulfovibrio piger increased after MTT-10wks in children with ASD compared to Baseline (consistent at genus level with the previous 16S rRNA gene study). Metabolic pathway analysis at Baseline compared to typically developing (TD) children found an altered abundance of many functional genes but, after MTT, they became similar to TD or donors. Important functional genes that changed included: genes encoding enzymes involved in folate biosynthesis, @sm$ sulfur @/sm$ metabolism and oxidative stress.	1
The relative abundance of groups Anaerostipes and Eubacterium hallii increased, while that of groups Calditerricola, @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$, Lactobacillus mucosa and Clostridium paraputrificum significantly decreased in the CKD-LPD versus the CKD-NPD samples. The metabolomics analysis indicated significant increases in the secondary bile acid glyco lambda-muricholic acid, significant decreases in the fatty acid @sm$ nonanoic acid @/sm$ and no difference in the uremic toxins IS and pCS in CKD-LPD versus NPD patients, whereas, when CKD patients were compared to healthy controls, an enrichment of bacterial metabolites related to D-alanine, ketone bodies and glutathione metabolism was observed.	2
The relative mRNA expression levels of genes encoding IgA and IL-6 were quantified in liver samples collected from turkeys 2 days after vaccination against @gm$ ORT @/gm$. The protocol of qRT-PCR analysis was described by Ognik et al.. The liver samples were immediately frozen in liquid @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$.	0
The response surface (Figure 4) gives us an indication for optimization similar to the previously described microorganism: less time, temperature, and concentration of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ predicting a microbial growth of about 7-7.5 for @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ 4452 (4A) and L.	2
The resultant list comprises 19 organisms/groups of organisms divided into five categories: single pathogenic species (@gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes); genera containing pathogenic species (Bacillus, Clostridium, Listeria, Salmonella; Staphylococcus); broad taxonomic groupings (Coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, fecal Streptococci, @sm$ sulfite @/sm$ reducing bacteria/@sm$ sulfite @/sm$ reducing Clostridia [SRBs/SRCs], yeasts and molds); organisms displaying certain growth preferences or resistance as regards temperature (endospores, psychrotrophs, thermodurics, thermophiles); indicators of quality (total plate count, Pseudomonas spp.).	2
The results from the ZOI test of the SNAP-PEG coating unveiled a significant difference in the diameter of the inhibited zone of growth for each tested formulation containing 1, 5, and 10 wt % of @sm$ SNAP @/sm$, and no zone of inhibition was observed for the control PEG sample, which was expected since the PEG control coating lacked any inherent antibacterial mechanism of action. The lack of a zone and the subsequent absence of antibacterial activity in the control PEG samples confirmed that the observed antibacterial effects were primarily attributed to the presence of @sm$ SNAP @/sm$ in the coating. The increased zone of inhibition was observed to be directly proportional to the increasing concentration of @sm$ SNAP @/sm$ present in the coating (Figure 4B,C). On average, the ZOI against @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ for the 5 wt % samples was 3.2 +- 0.54 mm2 and 7.5 +- 0.28 mm2 for 10 wt %. Similarly, the ZOI for E. coli was 7.5 +- 0.67 mm2 for 5 wt % and 14.8 +- 0.46 mm2 for 10 wt %. The ZOI for @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ against the 10 wt % SNAP-PEG coating had approximately 2x more than the 5 wt % (p < 0.05). Comparatively, the zone of inhibition for E. coli against the 10 wt % SNAP-PEG coating had approximately 2x and greater ZOI than the 1 and 5 wt %, respectively (p < 0.05). The antibacterial assay results align with the NO release data from each formulation (Figure 3B), showing a direct correlation between higher @sm$ SNAP @/sm$ concentrations and increased levels of NO release.	3
The results revealed that Parvimonas was positively correlated with the production of @sm$ adrenic acid @/sm$, and Fusobacterium was negatively correlated with indoleacrylic acid, which are both CRC-associated oral pathogens that have been known for a long time. @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$, a new Firmicutes species belonging to the dominant human colonic microbiota, was negatively correlated with arachidonic acid and tryptophan.	2
The results showed that @sm$ putrescine @/sm$, tyramine, histamine, cadaverine, tryptamine, spermidine, spermine, and total BAs were positively correlated with Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. In addition, @sm$ putrescine @/sm$, tyramine, histamine, and cadaverine had highly similar associations with the microbiota, showing significant positive associations with Salmonella enterica, unclassified_f_Enterobacteriacea, and most Klebsiella (including @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), but negatively correlated with Pediococcus acidilactici, Sphingomonas spp., Kosakonia cowanii, and Klebsiella cf.	1
The results showed that in the presence of hypertension in untreated B-CS individuals, including those in IVCHT+ PHT-, IVCHT- PHT+, and IVCHT+ PHT+ groups, the @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ population significantly increased and showed a significant positive correlation with taurocholate. In particular, taurocholate showed significant positive correlation with K00925: acetate kinase [EC: 2.7.2.1] of @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ in the IVCHT+ PHT+ population ( Figure 4 ). Further analysis of KEGG pathways revealed that taurocholate and dysregulated @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ are mainly associated with primary bile acid biosynthesis, @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis, and @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ metabolism, which are the key metabolic pathways involved in the development of liver diseases ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). Thus, @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ may affect taurocholate in serum, which in turn is involved in the development of hypertensive symptoms in patients with B-CS.	1
The results showed that the average isolation rates of @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ (@gm$ SS @/gm$), Haemophilus parasuis (HPS), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Brodetella bronchiseptica (Bb), Salmonella enteria (SE), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (E. rhusiopathiae) were 16.9%, 9.7%, 6.3%, 3.4%, 0.3%, 1.5%, 2.3% and 0.9%, respectively. The isolate rates of E. coli, APP and SE showed an increasing trend from 2013 to 2017. The seasonal prevalence characteristics of @gm$ SS @/gm$, HPS and Pm were obviously higher from April to August for first two bacteria and higher at February, March, April, and October for Pm. The dominant serotypes for @gm$ SS @/gm$, HPS were serotype 2 and serotype 5 (changed from serotype 4), respectively. The @gm$ SS @/gm$, HPS, and Pm showed very high antibiotic resistance rates to almost 8 common antibiotics (beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline, quinolone, polymyxin, and @sm$ sulfonamide @/sm$) and an obvious increasing trend of antibiotic resistance rates from 2013 to 2017.	4
The scattered dot plot, showing associations of gut microbiota species with glucose, @sm$ lipid @/sm$, and water-electrolyte metabolism in different groups, is shown in  Figure 2 . The abundance of Coprococcus_comes ( Figure 2B ), @gm$ Parabacteroides_merdae @/gm$ ( Figure 2C ), Roseburia_intestinalis ( Figure 2D ), Roseburia_inulinivorans ( Figure 2E ), and Bifidobacterium_adolescentis ( Figure 2F ) were significantly decreased in NASH patients. The detailed co-occurrence associations between glucose, @sm$ lipid @/sm$, and water-electrolyte metabolism (controlled for other anthropometric, demographic, and clinical data) and microbial are listed in  Appendix 6 .	0
The sequences of MDD proteins from organisms (Enterococcus faecalis; @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes; Listeria monocytogenes; Homo sapiens; Trypanosoma brucei; Mus musculus; Xenopus tropicalis; Bos taurus; Arabidopsis thaliana) were aligned using EBI Clustal Omega. The secondary structure elements were drawn using ESPript3.0 based on the structural model of MDDEF in complex with MVAPP, ADP, cobalt, and @sm$ sulfate @/sm$ (MDDEF-MVAPP-ADP-SO42-Co2+) in this study.	0
The sequential actions of threonine deaminase (TD) and hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (HO-HxoDH) convert the L-Thr product of TS to alpha-ketobutyrate (alpha-KB) and then to 2-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, and are monitored as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm resulting from the concomitant oxidation of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (@sm$ NADH @/sm$) to @sm$ NAD(+) @/sm$ by HO-HxoDH. The effect of pH on the activities of Escherichia coli TD and @gm$ Lactobacillus delbrueckii @/gm$ HO-HxoDH was determined to establish this continuous assay as suitable for steady-state characterization and to facilitate the optimization of coupling enzyme concentrations under different assay conditions to enable studies of TS across phyla.	2
The silver staining and the western blotting probed by anti-O2 and O4 were performed to determine the @sm$ LPS @/sm$ profiles of these mutants (Figure 1). The phage P22 infections were performed to further examine the biological changes due to O-antigen structure alteration, as the attachment of P22 to @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ is mediated by the binding of its tailspike protein to the O repeating units of groups B1, D1 and A1 in a different efficiency. Other phenotypes were also evaluated to investigate the effects posed by alteration of @sm$ LPS @/sm$ in the mutants (Table 2 and supplementary Figure S3). The results showed that the strain S1049 (Deltaabe::prt-tyvA1) produced a short @sm$ LPS @/sm$ containing only one or two O2 antigen O-units, and its growth rate were seriously affected (Supplementary Figure S3). Compared with the wild-type S. Typhimurium, the number of P22 transductions obtained from its derivatives were all significantly decreased (Table 2). In accordance with that observation, the MICs of deoxycholate and polymyxin B of S1049 were eight and two-fold lower than those of the wild-type S. Typhimurium, respectively. Meanwhile, the swimming mobility and the virulence attribute of S1049 were all severely affected (Table 2). A similar result was also observed for the strain S1071 [Delta(abe-wzxB1)::(prt-wzxA1)]. However, unlike S1049 and S1071, the strain S1072 (Deltaabe::prt-tyvA1 DeltawbaVB1::wbaVA1) could synthesize a better length of O-antigens, although not as well as S1074. The @sm$ LPS @/sm$ profile from S1074 [Delta(abe-wbaVB1)::(prt-wbaVA1)] was similar to that of the wild-type @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ (Figure 1).	3
The six isolates were tested for their susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds representing beta-lactams (ampicillin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), tetracyclines (tetracycline) and macrolides (erythromycin) plus @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ and the non-ribosomal peptide vancomycin using disc diffusion. The bacteria showed variation in their resistance profiles (Table 2) with Chryseobacterium species found to be the most resistant to the drugs including ampicillin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline whereas they were susceptible to erythromycin and vancomycin with >=18 mm zones of inhibition. @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ was susceptible to vancomycin, ampicillin, and @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ but resistant to kanamycin and tetracycline. A. johnsonii was sensitive to kanamycin, tetracycline and @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ but was resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin and erythromycin. E. ludwigii was erythromycin sensitive (17 mm zone of inhibition) but gentamicin, kanamycin and tetracycline resistant. P. stutzeri had intermediate resistance against four different drugs, susceptibility to @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ and resistance to kanamycin and tetracycline (Table 2).	3
The six species, Tpal, Tpar, Tde, Tpu, Tpe, and @gm$ Tsu @/gm$, possess relatively few transport proteins of ABC sugar uptake systems (TC#3.A.1.1), with an average of 3.2 per species compared to an average of 39 in the others. Transport proteins for sugars and @sm$ nucleosides @/sm$ (TC#3.A.1.2), however, are more balanced in their distributions (average of 8 compared to an average of 14). Proteins of ABC uptake systems primarily for amino acids (TC#3.A.1.3 and 3.A.1.4) are not as robustly represented, but are most prevalent in Taz, Tpr, and Tca. As for ABC uptake systems specific for amino acids, Tpal and Tpar have no representatives of peptide uptake systems (TC#3.A.1.5) whereas Tde, Tpu, Tpe, Taz, Tpr have at least two, each consisting of 5 proteins. Further analyses of ABC uptake systems reveal the continued deficiency of these transporters in the syphilis-causing Tpal and Tpar as well as the avirulent @gm$ Tsu @/gm$.	0
The spleen and the genital organs were analysed for @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ by culture. The spleen and genital tissues (2 g of each) were pooled, 2.5 mL sterile @sm$ water @/sm$ was added and the sample was homogenised for 2 min in a Stomacher  laboratory blender.	0
The statistical test to determine the probable enrichment of such protein domains on @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ genomes recovered 87 domain associations, and 54 of which had reliable functional annotations (Table 4). This analysis corroborated some previous observations during the CAZy gene survey. Thus, several domains associated with different GH and PL enzymes listed in Table 3, and related to xylan and @sm$ glycosaminoglycan @/sm$ degradation were also retrieved (e.g., GH10, GH79, GH43, PL8) (Table 4). Moreover, we also observed that other domains linked to xylan binding and degradation were enriched in @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ genomes (e.g., Glyco_hydro_30, CBM_6, Glyco_hydro_3, Bac_rhamnosid). Nevertheless, the glycan metabolism domains enriched in @gm$ B. cellulosilyticus @/gm$ in comparison with other Bacteroides species is also accompanied by a higher abundance of polysaccharide degradation functions as well as of sensor and kinase subunits of several two-component systems specialized on carbohydrate uptake.	2
The strain had nine antimicrobial resistance genes mediating resistance to beta-lactams (blaKPC-2, blaLAP-2, blaOXY-6-4), fosfomycin (fosA), quinolones (oqxA, oqxB, qnrS1), @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ (catA), and tetracycline [tet(A)]. There are seven Klebsiella genomes containing blaOXY-6 available in the GenBank(Table 2). Although these strains were commonly reported as K. oxytoca or @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ in their records in GenBank, they had >99% ANI values with K.	4
The strain shows high similarity values (95.8 to 96.4%) with Klebsiella species, and the closest known relative was found to be @gm$ K. ornithinolytica @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 31898 @/gm$. The result indicates that species of the genus Klebsiella were the closest phylogenetic relatives of the investigated strain. This is the first known report of a member of Klebsiella that is capable of utilizing thiocyanate as sole source of @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and nitrogen.	2
The strains were cultivated at 37  C for 24 h without @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ limitation. Afterward, the bacterial monocultures grown on specific prebiotic were mixed in the amount of 1 mL of cultures of all probiotic strains with each pathogen separately. An initial number of bacteria was assessed by preparing serial decimal dilutions of each mixture, which were then used in the pour plate technique with MRS agar, Salmonella Shigella agar (SS agar; Merck Millipore), and PALCAM agar (Merck Millipore) for probiotics, Salmonella spp., and @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, respectively. Next, the co-cultures of probiotics and pathogens were incubated at 37  C without @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ limitation.	2
The strains were highly resistant to the four first-line antituberculous agents tested on them, especially @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, M. abscessus, and M. fortuitum. We found that aminoglycoside antibiotics including amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, and @sm$ tobramycin @/sm$, were effective antimicrobials for the RGM species. However, M. abscessus was resistant to @sm$ tobramycin @/sm$ and @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ was resistant to kanamycin and capreomycin. Fluoroquinolones (including ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and moxifloxacin) also exhibited favorable in vitro activities against the standard RGM strains. However, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ was resistant to all four of the fluoroquinolones we tested. @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M. abscessus were not susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline, but were susceptible to tigecycline. Clarithromycin, azithromycin, and roxithromycin all exhibited favorable in vitro activities (except for azithromycin) against M. septicum. The reference species were not susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid but were susceptible or moderately susceptible to cefoxitin and cefmetazole, apart from @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M. septicum, which were not susceptible to cefoxitin. Unlike @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, the RGM species were susceptible to meropenem. Rifapentine had a more favorable MIC than rifabutin against @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, M.	4
The study emphasizes that both the conditions are associated with decreased Firmicutes populations, with a specific reduction in @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ cells, which produces different kinds of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) under anaerobic conditions. The study also examines how gut dysbiosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and energy demand affect key metabolites such as tryptophan, @sm$ phenylalanine @/sm$, histidine, glutamine, succinate, and citrate levels in the gut.	1
The sugar phosphate utilizing microcompartments (SPU) are emerging as one of the most widespread types of BMCs; they are predicted to be involved in DNA catabolism via the @sm$ deoxyribose @/sm$/deoxyribulose 5-phosphate degradation pathway. The degradation of exogenous DNA, a common component of detritus, is a source of carbon and energy. Organisms containing SPU4 BMCs such as @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, Clostridium sp.	2
The suitable growth conditions of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ NDRMN001 for PHB synthesize were optimized by following the procedure of and with some modifications. Hence, the appropriate growth (one at a time) conditions such as percentage (2.5, 5, 7.5,10, 12.5, and 15%) of inoculum (2 x 108 CFU mL), 20 g L-1 of carbon sources (sugar molasses, rice bran, and sago molasses), 2 g L of @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ sources (peptone, NaNO3, and yeast extract), physical factors like temperature (25; 30; 35; 40; and 45  C), pH (5.5; 6.5; 7.5; , 8.5; and 9.5), and incubation time (12; 24; 36; 48; 60, and 72 h) were assessed. The simple PHB production medium was used with the amendment of test carbon and @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ sources with different physical parameters. Triplicates were performed with each parameter to get reproducible results and incubated on a shaker incubator for three days with 150 rpm, and the quantity of PHB and cell biomass produced under optimized conditions were studied. The growth kinetics of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ NDRMN001 in PHB synthesize was studied by following the protocol of. Briefly, the growth of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ (600 nm) and PHB synthesis (400 nm) were analyzed in a spectrophotometer with respective wavelengths in a day interval basis.	2
The suppressive effects of THC on IDO1 expression were systemic and not restricted to the gingiva as metabolomic profiling revealed significantly reduced plasma concentrations of the IDO1 catalyzed metabolite @sm$ kynurenine @/sm$ and its downstream metabolites kynurenate and quinolinic acid. Finally, chronic THC successfully ameliorated HIV/SIV induced salivary dysbiosis of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and reduced Gammaproteobacteria abundance in saliva. Further, chronic THC preserved the relative abundance of the commensal @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria and reduced the relative abundance of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas cangingivalis and Porphyromonas macacae.	0
The surgical procedure for retrograde pancreatic ductal infusion of the @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$ was as previously described. Briefly, 100 muL of purified @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$ (titer 2 x 1012 plaque-forming units) was infused into the biliopancreatic duct at a rate of 10 muL/min for 10 minutes using a P33 peristaltic syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Surgical anesthesia was achieved by inhaling isoflurane and @sm$ oxygen @/sm$. A single injection of the analgesic buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg) was given immediately after the surgery. Mice recovered on a heating pad for 30 minutes and were housed for 4-6 weeks with free access to food and water before induction of PEP. To verify the efficacy of the @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$ infusion, LSL-Tm mice were used.	0
The survival of single strains of @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4  C) aerobic storage conditions. When the matrices were cross-linked with @sm$ calcium @/sm$ (45 mM), 102-103 cfu/ml of L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of B. breve and B. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. Following refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mM), butyric (0-2 mM), propionic (5-16 mM) and lactic acids (1-48 mM) were produced during the growth of probiotics in BHI broth at 37  C, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed. When @sm$ calcium @/sm$ cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the @sm$ calcium @/sm$ cross-linked matrix.	3
The survival of virB mutants, of the complemented mutants virB10::Gm and DeltavirB11::Gm and of wild-type @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ was determined by quantitating the CFU of each strain in mouse spleens at different time intervals post-infection. Groups of 15 7-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with 1.4 x 108 CFU of the virB10::Gm strain or the DeltavirB11::Gm strain in 0.1 ml of @sm$ PBS @/sm$. At 7, 21, 35, and 45 days post-infection (p.i.), animals were sacrificed, and spleens were removed and homogenized in @sm$ PBS @/sm$. Tissue homogenates were serially diluted with @sm$ PBS @/sm$ and were plated onto tryptic soy broth-agar with the appropriate antibiotics to determine the numbers of CFU per spleen.	0
The susceptibility of 424 bacterial isolates causing diarrhoea were tested by agar dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton Agar against amoxicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, norfloxacin and ofloxacin. The bacterial species included were Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, @gm$ Pleisomonas shigelloides @/gm$, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.	3

The synthesis of butyrate in SCFAs is orchestrated from diverse precursors such as @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, organic acids, glutamic acid and lysine, facilitated predominantly by microbial communities within the gut. Renowned producers of butyrate include bacterial families Lachnospiraceae (including Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia inulinivorans and others) and Ruminococcus (spanning species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$).	1
The tet gene is known to be responsible for @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance. Most tet genes originated from periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. The percentage of @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-resistant isolates in dental plaque-associated bacteria is high in children from South Asia and Japan. Isolates of T. denticola that are resistant to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ have also been reported. Resistance to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ is a frequent co-marker among penicillin-resistant species of oral origin. Resistance to erythromycin usually occurs due to acquiring two significant genes, ermF and erm. Major periodontal bacteria such as T. forsythia and P. gingivalis can carry both emr and tet resistance genes. Clindamycin resistance shows a high prevalence among periodontal isolates of F. nucleatum (36%), P. gingivalis (23%), and @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ (22%) in Columbia.	4
The therapeutic effects of @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$ administration are decreased by some particular bacterial organisms, such as @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$, which drives Treg effects and SFBs that, in turn, drive Th17 responses. In response to @sm$ cyclophosphamide @/sm$, certain types of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus hirae and Lactobacillus johnsonii, have been reported to increase and carry Th1 memory cells into the lumen.	3
The tissue culture of specimen of mycotic aneurysm also revealed @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$. Parenteral ceftriaxone (2g) ivd q12h was administered for eight weeks after surgery. After discharge from the hospital, oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid and @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ 600 mg qd were administered for another eight-week course.	3
The transport of protons and potassium ions across the membranes of the bacteria @gm$ Enterococcus hirae @/gm$ growing in an alkaline medium (pH 8.0) or under experimental conditions (pH 7.5) during @sm$ glucose @/sm$ fermentation accomplished by a KtrI-system of absorption of potassium ions, which can interact with F0F1-ATPase to form at H(+)-K(+)-pump, has been studied.	2
The use of amoxicillin has also been shown to reduce the abundances of Neisseria, @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$, and Veillonella in the oral microbiota. In another study, a group of neonates was enriched in @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ biosynthesis and amino-acid-related metabolic functions after maternal antibiotic exposure, whereas the group of unexposed neonates was enriched in carbohydrate metabolic pathways.	3
The use of tricyclic antidepressants was associated with an increased abundance of Clostridium leptum and intake of @sm$ levothyroxine @/sm$ was associated with a higher abundance of Actinomyces in the IBD cohort (linear regression, t-test, FDR = 0.005 and 0.005, respectively, Supplementary Data 47). In addition, the 17 steroid inhaler users in the IBS cohort showed a higher abundance of Streptococcus mutans and @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$ in their gut microbiome (linear regression, t-test FDR = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively, Supplementary Data 40).	0
The validated species-specific primer sequences used were: Roseburia intestinalis F-CGAAGCACTTTATTTGATTTCTTCGG, R- TTTTTCACACCAGGTCATGCG; Roseburia hominis F- AAGTCTTGACATCCCACTGACA, R- CACCACTGCTCCGAAGAGAA; Roseburia inulinivorans F- GACATCCTTCTGACCGGACAG, R- GGCTACTGGGGATAAGGGTTG; @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$ F- CGCAACCCCTGTCCTTAGTAG, R- AGATTTGCTCGGCCTCACG. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Real-time PCR reactions were prepared in a 10 microL volume containing 5 microL 2x SYBR Green, 3 microL nuclease free @sm$ water @/sm$, 1 microL primer mix (a mixture of forward and reverse primer of 5 microM each), and 1 microL DNA template.	0
The within-module connectivity (Zi) and the between-module-connectivity (@sm$ Pi @/sm$) of species revealed that only A. putredenis from module3-HC and F. saccharivorans from module1-HC were identified as module hubs in the AggCN (Figure 5D). In the AggMN, only F. prausnitzii was identified as a module hub (Figure 5E), indicating that F. prausnitzii has increased connectivity to other species within module1-ME. Many of the species that were identified as connectors in either group (asterisks in Figure 5C: i.e., @gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$, R. gnavus, E. coli, and T. nexilis) shuffled between modules. This suggests that many connectors, with low Zi and high @sm$ Pi @/sm$, are more prone to module shuffling, driven by establishment of unique between-module interactions or the loss of unique within-module interactions.	0
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most established organism for ethanol production, efficiently converts @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and other hexoses to ethanol. In addition, the yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis and the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis can produce ethanol under industrial conditions (Blomqvist and Passoth; Gupta et al.); it has for instance been shown that B. bruxellensis can ferment oat straw hydrolysate to ethanol (Tiukova et al.). Those industrial ethanol producers have a high ethanol tolerance and they can adapt to inhibitors present in lignocellulose hydrolysate (e.g. Blomqvist et al.; Tiukova et al.). However, these microorganisms cannot assimilate xylose and other pentoses derived from hemicellulose. To obtain an economically feasible ethanol process from lignocellulose, it is also desirable to convert the hemicellulose sugars to ethanol. Substantial efforts have been made to obtain xylose-fermenting, inhibitor-tolerant S. cerevisiae strains (Passoth; Passoth). Finally, by a combination of metabolic and evolutionary engineering of industrial S. cerevisiae isolates, strains were obtained that can ferment both @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and xylose in lignocellulose hydrolysate. These strains overexpress specific transporters for xylose, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the xylose assimilation pathway:either xylose reductase/xylitol dehydrogenase of the xylose-fermenting yeast Scheffersomyces stipitis (Garcia Sanchez et al.) or a codon-optimised xylose isomerase from @gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$ (Demeke et al.; Demeke et al., Fig.	2
Theglass slide with immobilized @gm$ S. paratyphi @/gm$ was brought into contact with the monomer solution on the chip. Polymerization was initiated by UV light (100 W and 365 nm) and lasted for 20 min under @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ atmosphere.	0
Then, 5 mul of @sm$ LPS @/sm$ reaction samples were loaded onto methanol-activated PVDF membrane using a Bio-Rad Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus. The protocol for @sm$ LPS @/sm$ detection with O:5 serotyping antibodies and @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ core antigen was followed as per immunoblotting, following removal of the membrane from the apparatus after sample loading.	0
Then, peroxide II is in equilibrium with @sm$ TEMPO @/sm$ and  OH radicals, given the energy difference between both states (Delta = -1.12 kcal mol-1). On the other hand (route B), TMP-H combines with n-BuLi producing TMP-Li and n-butane (Delta = -21.53 kcal mol-1). The TMP-Li anion can transfer an electron to the  OH radical leading to TMP  radical and OH- spontaneously (Delta = -12.89 kcal mol-1). Both @sm$ TEMPO @/sm$ and TMP  radicals do not combine in solution to derive TMP2O according to the calculated energy (Delta = +20.27 kcal mol-1). However, because of the harsh conditions carried out during the HRMS technique, it is very possible that the TMP2O can be detected as a single molecule. Also, an aside reaction (route @gm$ C) comes @/gm$ from the possibility that  OH radical absorbs one electron not only from TMP-Li anion but from the initial Bu- of n-BuLi. This reaction is more exergonic (Delta = -24.33 kcal mol-1) than the previous ones. And the reaction between @sm$ TEMPO @/sm$ and Bu  radicals that gives TMP-O-nBu is also more favorable (Delta = -32.03 kcal mol-1). Thus, this product is mostly obtained than @sm$ TEMPO @/sm$ and TMP  radicals, according to our calculations.	0
There are studies supporting the idea that peaks in estrogen during the menstrual cycle (periovulatory and luteal phases) enhance vaginal microbiota stability, and promote @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ predominance, by regulating @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ availability in the vaginal epithelium.	1
There is also an increase in the levels of other microbial groups that can metabolize smaller compounds that are either present in the feed (e.g., plant monosaccharides such as tagatose) or produced as end products from other microbial symbionts (e.g., @sm$ lactate @/sm$) into SCFAs. These specialists include members of families such as Veillonellaceae (e.g., Megasphaera) or Oscillospiraceae (e.g., Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$).	2
There were 3 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (carbon metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and sesquiterpenoid and @sm$ triterpenoid @/sm$ biosynthesis) and 7 antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) (macrolide lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), tetracycline, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, fosmidomycin, lincomycin, and vancomycin) that showed significant differences between the 2 groups (all P < 0.05). The abundance of Actinomycetes was enriched (about 2.4-fold) in young adults. Bifidobacteria dominated in both young adults and elderly subjects, with overall higher abundances in young adults (P > 0.05). Only the @gm$ Bifidobacterium_dentium @/gm$ species showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P = 0.013), with a higher abundance in elderly subjects but absent in young adults. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that there were 3 KEGG metabolic pathways and 7 ARGs as well as enhanced @gm$ Bifidobacterium_dentium @/gm$ species abundance in elderly compared to young subjects.	0
There were approximately 1.6 million new cases of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGI), with about 1.29 million death cases after lung cancer in the world according to GLOBOCAN 2018.1 Both stomach and esophageal cancers are among the top five leading causes of cancer deaths in China.2 Human vulnerability to UGI cancer is influenced by environmental factors including @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ drinking and tobacco smoking for squamous cell carcinoma, and @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ and tobacco smoking for adenocarcinomas.3, 4 It is thought that diet plays an important role in the etiology of UGI cancer, although there is not yet any convincing evidence.	3
There were significant differences in the age, diabetes, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), C-reactive protein (CRP) between infection and no infection group (all P < .05), and there were not differences in the sex, body mass index, @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ drinking, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, length of hospital stay between 2 groups (all P > .05). Logistic regression analyses indicated that age >=70 years, diabetes, NYHA grade III, LVEF <=55%, and CRP >=10 mg/L were the independent risk factors of pulmonary infections in patients with heart failure (all P < .05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (34.48%), Staphylococcus aureus (19.57%), and @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ (15.22%) were the most common 3 pathogens in patients with pulmonary infection.Heart failure patients with age >=70 years, diabetes, NYHA grade III, LVEF <=55%, and CRP >=10 mg/L have higher risks of pulmonary infections, preventive measures targeted on those risk factors are needed to reduce pulmonary infections.	0
Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the GT-EO in vitro and food systems, the antimicrobial impact (AI) of its individual compounds, and interactive effects of major active compounds (@sm$ linalool @/sm$, 4-terpineol, alpha-terpineol, rho-cymene) on selected Gram-positive (S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ and S. sanguinis) and Gram-negative (E. coli O157:H7, V. parahaemolyticus and S. enterica) pathogens. RESULTS: The minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) of the GT-EO ranged from 0.75 to 12 mg mL(-1) against the test bacteria in vitro. Except for L. monocytogenes, the GT-EO exhibited more inhibitory effect on the selected Gram positive than against the Gram negative bacteria at the GT-EO concentrations <= 12 mg mL(-1) . The interactive effects of major active compounds (@sm$ linalool @/sm$, 4-terpineol, alpha-terpineol, rho-cymene) are additive instead of synergistic via the checkerboard analysis.	3
Therefore, the differential effects of @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ inoculation on NILs is not due to the total amount of digestible sugars in the NILs, but rather the accessibility of those @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ to enzymatic digestion, which is therefore strongly influenced by lignin content. Fermentation of the same material by S. cerevisiae after dilute acid pre-treatment and cellulase and beta-glucosidase enzymatic digestion produced improvements in ethanol-conversion efficiency of 11% and 17% for the single and double mutants, respectively. The differences in ethanol production by NILs digested by S. cerevisiae were far less pronounced than those digested with @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$. Considering that xylose yield was roughly constant across the NILs, and that S. cerevisiae is capable of fermenting hexoses only, it is likely that the differences in ethanol yield were due to differential enzymatic release of glucose. @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ digests plant biomass with secreted cellulolytic enzymes, and subsequently imports and metabolizes pentoses and hexoses.	2
Therefore, two kinds of spontaneously acidified Belgian sausages were prepared (Belgian-type salami and Boulogne sausage), but with addition of a @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$ culture. The Belgian-type salami was made from pork and beef, whereas the Boulogne sausage contained pork and horse meat. In all cases, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant LAB species present on the raw materials and during fermentation, whereas enterococci remained present in the background. Enterobacteriaceae vanished after fermentation. The CNS species diversity on the raw materials was large and differed between the pork, beef, and horse meat. Nevertheless, this species diversity was annihilated during fermentation by the added @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ culture. The volatiles fraction was mainly composed of @sm$ aldehydes @/sm$ that originated from lipid oxidation and spices-derived compounds. Aromatic compounds that are typically associated to CNS activity, such as end-products from the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, were not present in the Belgian-type salami and only marginally present in the Boulogne sausage. In conclusion, spontaneous acidification of Belgian-type fermented sausages leads to dominance of L. sakei and is no guarantee for bacterial contribution to the aroma profile when @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ is added as a starter culture.	1
Therein, 30 contigs were classified to 18 @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species. Two monooxygenase gene variants tet(X3) and tet(X6) conferring resistance to @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$ were detected with higher abundance in @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ dominant groundwater (e.g., tet(X3) in JZPG5 and tet(X6) in JZPG4, Supplementary Table S8 of Supporting Information 2). In the NCBI nt database, the conservative genetic environment of tet(X3) has been reported in the plasmids of seven @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species (Fig. 3b). Some ARGs conferring resistance to other antibiotic classes, such as sul2, aph(3') and mph(E)/(G) were colocalized with this structure. Meanwhile, tet(X6) has been detected in the chromosomes and plasmids of six species including A. baumannii, A. towneri, A. indicus, A. piscatorial, A. schindleri and A. pseudolwoffii. Besides tet(X), trimethoprim resistance gene dfrA were also observed colocalized with multiple ARGs and MGEs in @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ and other bacteria (Supplementary Fig.	4
These abnormalities and some of the behaviors were improved by giving orally a human commensal @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ (not traditionally viewed as a probiotic). In a biomarker discovery study in 52 young children with ASD who were compared to neurotypical controls, a number of plasma markers were found to be altered, many of them were directly related to mitochondrial metabolism. These included elevated succinic acid, @sm$ aspartate @/sm$, glutamate, and aminoisobutyrate and decreased citric acid, isoleucine, and creatinine.	0
These bacteria, together with the taxa in the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-metabolizing Ruminococcaceae family and non-pathogenic species in the genus @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ (all of which are present in our data), are considered common occupants of termite guts. @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ is also a common constituent of healthy non-human primate guts.	2
These fatty acids, however, are esterified to @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$, phospholipids, and cholesterol. In this study, the major pathways of complex lipid catabolism in T. phagedenis, T. denticola, T. refringens, T. minutum, and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ were investigated. Lipase activity was demonstrated in five Treponema species using four lipid substrates. Chromatographic data demonstrated that, during growth, treponemes completely utilized lysophosphatidylcholine, present in serum-supplemented culture media, while phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol were not utilized. Phospholipase B and glycerophosphorylcholine diesterase activities were demonstrated in the five species of Treponema studied. Treponema phagedenis and T. denticola had phosphatase activity, while T. refringens, T. minutum, and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ did not have an acid phosphatase activity.	2
These findings suggest that @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is capable of active uptake of a diverse array of metabolites, including multiple oligosaccharides and simple sugars. The presence of GH genes adjacent to 50% of the transporter loci, suggests that carbohydrate degradation and uptake are frequently coupled. @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ may feed cytoplasmic oligosaccharides into glycolysis via cellobiose/cellodextrin phosphorylases as occurs in other cellulolytic bacteria. Import of oligosaccharides followed by internal hydrolysis via phosphorolysis minimizes @sm$ ATP @/sm$ consumption.	2
These genera are: @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$, Megasphaera, Parvimonas, Anaerostipes, Eubacterium, Anaerococcus, Methylobacterium, Holdemania, Turicibacter, Akkermansia, Sutterella, Sphingomonas, Anaerotruncus, Coprococcus, Streptococcus and Dorea. @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ was described to convert dietary lignans to the bioactive enterolactone. Megasphaera spp. have been described as propionate-producers that utilize @sm$ lactate @/sm$ comparable to Veillonella spp. that were no longer detected by 454 sequencing after chemotherapy. The butyrate-producing Anaerostipes caccae and Eubacterium hallii utilize @sm$ lactate @/sm$ as well. They were suggested to compete for @sm$ lactate @/sm$ with sulfate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfobacter piger whose preferred co-substrate is @sm$ lactate @/sm$.	2
These included Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptococcus niger and Peptostreptococcus spp. After the NMR analysis (256/512 scans), the different peaks were noted. The eight pus specimens, which yielded pure culture of anaerobe, also were analysed similarly. RESULTS: The major resonances of multiplex of amino acids/lipid at 0.9 ppm along with lactate/lipid at 1.3 ppm, @sm$ acetate @/sm$ at 1.92 ppm and multiplex of lysine at 3.0 ppm remained constant to label the organism as an anaerobe.	1
These included the causative agents for (i) enteric fever (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella paratyphi B and @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi C @/gm$), (ii) food poisoning (Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus), (iii) dysentery (Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei), and (iv) cholera (Vibrio cholerae). The growth of all these organisms was inhibited at the MIC of 10mg/ml of the extract, which is equivalent to 2.5mug/ml of active extractable @sm$ flavonoids @/sm$.	3
These isolates included a @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) E. coli, an MDR E. coli, an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ (@gm$ KPN @/gm$), a New Delhi Metallo beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) @gm$ KPN @/gm$, and an MDR S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm). Phenotypic antibiotic resistance characterization of the clinical isolates was performed using nine antibiotics of varied mechanisms and classes, and comparing to 2016-2017 CLSI breakpoint values (Fig. 2c, Table S1). We found all isolates to have resistance to two or more antibiotics, with CRE E. coli showing resistance to all nine antibiotics tested (Table S2). Genome sequencing showed all of the clinical isolates to have at least two unique antibiotic resistance genes, and at least one beta-lactamase gene (Fig. 2c, Table S3 & S4). The sequencing also allowed us to confirm the presence of each antisense target sequence in each isolate. In addition, Find Off-Targets was used to search these genome assemblies for off-targets around the start codon. Among all PNA and MDR strains we predicted only one PNA to have a single inhibitory off-target in each clinical isolate, alpha-rpsD in MDR STm and alpha-acrA in CRE E. coli, MDR E. coli, ESBL @gm$ KPN @/gm$, and NDM-1 @gm$ KPN @/gm$ (Fig.	4
These isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) Escherichia coli (66 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), Serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and Citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ (55 isolates). Overall, carbapenems (@sm$ imipenem @/sm$ and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). However, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ (51-56% of isolates were susceptible). Among the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. Over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae and C. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. Susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ to 92% for E. cloacae. Newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ for which their MIC(90)s (8-16 mg/L) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) 128 mg/L).	4
These probes were mainly comprised of gold nanoparticles conjugated with capturing DNA probes of 20-mer @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ specifically targeting Sdf I sequence of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ (Figure S1). The capturing DNA @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ are preferentially modified with a thiol group at 3' end and a Raman active dye of cy5 at the thymine nucleotide exists at position 6 from the same end of DNA to allow controlled and directional coupling of the @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ to gold nanoparticles. This eventually brings cy5 in the close proximity (< 2 nm) to the surface of gold nanoparticles, allowing a significant enhancement of Raman signal intensity. When these probes are added to the target DNA, and as a result for the specific hybridization of cy5 labeled DNA capturing probes to its complementary sequence, Au nanoprobes-target DNA hybridization complexes are formed and easily detected using SERS based upon the distinctive Raman spectral features of cy5. In addition, we relied on an enzyme digestion step using S1 nuclease to differentiate the presence and absence of target DNA. S1 nuclease is known to specifically degrade single-stranded (ss) DNA into free mononucleotides (dNTPs). In the presence of the target DNA, the probes specifically bind to its complementary sequence and form a double-stranded DNA structure in which the complex cy5-DNAs are protected from nuclease digestion and eventually cy5 remains linked to the surface of gold nanoparticles. In contrast, in the absence of the target DNA, S1 nuclease triggers the release of cy5 from the surface of gold nanoparticles by digesting the surface capturing DNA @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ of Au-nanoprobes, resulting in a significantly reduced Raman signal intensity.	0
These results suggest that the utilization of host @sm$ amino acids @/sm$ by intestinal bacteria is different in healthy people, IBD, and CRC. Besides, PWY-6737 (starch degradation V), PWY-6126 (superpathway of adenosine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis II), PWY-7229 (superpathway of adenosine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis I), PWY-6125 (superpathway of guanosine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis II), PWY-7219 (adenosine ribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis), and PWY-3841 (folate transformations II) pathways have also changed (Figure 5A), and the other study also reported that folate biosynthesis, starch degradation pathway, nucleotides metabolism, energy metabolism and intermediates of @sm$ amino acids @/sm$ were affected. Moreover, the change of PWY-6737 was mainly related to the change of Firmicutes (Ruminococcus_bromii; @gm$ Coprococcus_comes @/gm$; Ruminococcus_torques; Dorea_formicigenerans; Eubacterium_hallii). Compared with the healthy controls and CRC patients, the relative abundances of Ruminococcus_bromii, @gm$ Coprococcus_comes @/gm$, Ruminococcus_torques, Dorea_formicigenerans, and Eubacterium_hallii were down-regulated in IBD.	2
These strains are closely related to soil bacteria and therefore better adapted to natural environments with harsh conditions, where at least one of these AR systems could be a major survival benefit, depending on the availability of corresponding substrates (i.e., urea, @sm$ Glu @/sm$, or Gln). The phylogenetically more recent and terrestrial zoonotic Brucella species have retained only a functional urease system. Possibly, these strains do not enter their host by the intestinal mucosa, but through the genital mucous membranes or the tonsils, for example, and/or they can counter the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract exclusively by degrading the urea available in the stomach. Finally, in a small group of strains such as @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and B. abortus bv. 1 strain 544, no known AR mechanisms are present, which might force them to exclusively use tonsils, sexual, and vertical routes of transmission between animals. If our hypothesis is correct, this could also explain why @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ is not at the origin of a foodborne zoonosis.	2
These two loci are homologous to known PULs involved in FOS metabolism in the closely related @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, suggesting that they are involved in @sm$ fructose @/sm$ polymer metabolism (Figs.	2
These were distinct from fecal samples of patients without COVID-19 who had higher abundance of SCFAs-producing bacteria, including @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_1_57FAA. It is now well-recognized that SCFAs exert several beneficial effects, influencing a number metabolic (as the @sm$ lipids @/sm$, cholesterol and glucose metabolism) and inflammatory (as the butyrate-mediated inhibition of macrophagic NF-kappaB or inhibition of the LPS-induced cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40) responses.	1
These were purchased from a local drugstore (Drugstore) and 1 g of each food was homogenized with 9 ml @sm$ PBS @/sm$. The absence of the three target pathogens was confirmed by culturing. The homogenates were inoculated with @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp., E.	0
They carry periplasmic contents, such as lipoproteins, @sm$ lipids @/sm$, and outer membrane proteins. Furthermore, some pathogenic G- bacteria produce another type of vesicle, called Inner Outer Membrane Vesicles (IOMVs). They contain pieces from both cytoplasmic and periplasmic membranes and are enriched with ATPs and DNA. Three models demonstrating OMV production were reviewed by C. Volgers and his team in 2018 (Figure 2). These models suggest that the production technique maintains the outer membrane homeostatic state. Accordingly, OMVs are produced when outer membrane asymmetry is achieved (Model A), misfolded proteins are condensed in the outer membrane (Model B), and lipopolysaccharides are modified (Model C). The outer membrane of G- bacteria is characterized by the asymmetric distribution of @sm$ lipids @/sm$ with lipopolysaccharides on the outer side and phospholipids on the inner side of the membrane. Defects in this asymmetric distribution lead to increased microbial vesiculation (Model A). Furthermore, model A can be achieved by reduced interactions between the outer membrane @sm$ lipids @/sm$ and the peptidoglycan layer. The genes involved in this model include genes encoding the proteins associated with the peptidoglycan layer, such as: Oprl, OmpA, Pal or TolA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; TolA, TolQ and Tol/Pal in E. coli; OmpA in Acinetobacter baumannii; and the ABC-transporter VacJ/YrbC in Haemophilus influenzae and @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$, and its homolog, Mla, in E.	1
They contribute to the maturation and modulation of the immune system by enhancing cytokines production, and inhibiting pathogenic bacterial adhesion and activity by @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ secretion. Many studies report on the efficiency of lactobacilli in preventing the intestinal diseases, the ability to restore the normal microbiota and the prevention of inflammation. These authors showed that four distinct Lactobacillus spp. (@gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$, L.	1
They detected the metabolites of quercetin including @sm$ 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid @/sm$, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and phenylacetic acid and deduced the metabolic pathway of quercetin in rat gut (Fig. 5). Only 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was detected in the fermented broths of @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ and B. fragilis, and no metabolites were found in the other broths, which indicated that only @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ and B.	1
They express a semi-invariant TCRValpha7.2-Jalpha33/20/12 in humans and recognize derivatives of @sm$ riboflavin @/sm$ metabolism in bacteria and yeasts presented on major histocompatibility complex class Ib-like molecules (MR1). In addition, MAIT cells could be activated by cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18 in a TCR-independent fashion which is important in the immune response against non-@sm$ riboflavin @/sm$-synthesizing bacteria and viruses. Upon activation, MAIT cells rapidly produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17) and cytolytic molecules (granzyme B and perforin). Studies from mouse studies suggest that MAIT cells play a protective role in both bacterial and viral pulmonary infection, such as @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$ and influenza A.	0
They include indole-3-lactate, which is a @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolite produced notably by the bacteria belonging to the Lacticaseibacillus, Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Megamonas, Roseburia, or Ruminococcus genus.	1
They noticed both stimulating and inhibiting dose-dependent effects on @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ and B. bifidum when adding narininin, @sm$ hesperidin @/sm$, rutin, and quercetin, as well as gallic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, chlorogenic, vanilla, and sinapic acids. Thus, @sm$ hesperidin @/sm$ and quercetin markedly reduced the growth of both bifidobacteria species; however, in the first hours of incubation, rutin boosted the growth to 37%, and quercetin, @sm$ hesperidin @/sm$, and naringin boosted it up to about 20% in the case of B. bifidum. The largest stimulating effect was observed with coumaric acid supplementation, which induced an increase in growth in the earliest stages to about 50% of B. bifidum and had no effect on @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$.	3
They resulted in a decrease of fat mass, attenuation of systemic inflammation, reduced serum LPS concentration, improved @sm$ glucose @/sm$ tolerance and lipid metabolism in obese rodents and/or humans. These beneficial metabolic outcomes were accompanied by an increased abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella. and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$.	0
They serve to acetylate xenobiotics and/or endogenous substrates using @sm$ acetyl coenzyme A @/sm$ (CoA) as a cofactor. Conservation of the architecture of the NAT enzyme family from mammals to bacteria has been demonstrated by a series of prokaryotic NAT structures, together with the recently reported structure of human NAT1. We report here the cloning, purification, kinetic characterisation and crystallographic structure determination of NAT from @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$, a close relative of the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have also determined the structure of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ NAT in complex with CoA, shedding the first light on cofactor recognition in prokaryotic NATs. Surprisingly, the principal CoA recognition site in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ NAT is located some 30 A from the site of CoA recognition in the recently deposited structure of human NAT2 bound to CoA.	2
They used it on @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$, which is one of the most important bacteria causing failure of the root-canal treatment. Owing to its low temperature, the plasma could be touched and placed into the root canal without any pain. A mix of Helium & @sm$ Oxygen @/sm$ was used. They observed that the plasma jet was efficient at deactivating @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$.	3
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and total carbohydrate analysis indicated that the enterotype of the gut microbiota could affect the utilization profiles of marine algae @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ (Figure 1B-G). Specifically, microbiota with a @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ enterotype was more proficient at fermenting carrageenan oligosaccharides (KOS) as compared to that with a Prevotella enterotype and that with an Escherichia enterotype (Figure 1C,F). Interestingly, a similar pattern was also seen for alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) (Figure 1D,G). However, it is of significance to note that the three enterotypes of gut microbiota have indistinguishable effects on the utilization profiles of agar oligosaccharides (QOS) (Figure 1B,E). QOS, AOS, and KOS are structurally different (Figure S2), and this indicated that the chemical structures could also affect the fermentation processes of the marine algae @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$.	2
Thirty strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens isolated in diverse geographical locations were examined for esterase activity by using naphthyl esters of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate, caprylate, laurate, and palmitate. All strains possessed some esterase activity, and high levels of activity were observed with strains 49, H17c, S2, AcTF2, and LM8/1B. Esterase activity also was detected in other ruminal bacteria (@gm$ Bacteroides ruminicola @/gm$, Selenomonas ruminantium, Ruminobacter amylophilus, and Streptococcus bovis).	2
This O-Ag has more similarity to an @sm$ LPS @/sm$, which may be relevant for Shigella GMMA characterisation. This method highlights that O-Ag purification must be optimal to fully characterise GMMA constituents; however, the approach may be useful to evaluate the proportion of larger Mw components with HPAEC-PAD, and seems to work well as a direct O-Ag separation method in enteric @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ (Micoli et al.).	0
This enzyme is part of the shikimate pathway, catalysing an equilibrium reaction that interconverts chorismate and prephenate in the production of @sm$ phenylalanine @/sm$ and tyrosine. In pathogenic yersinias,  Yersinia pestis ,  Yersinia pseudotuberculosis  and  @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$  biogroup 1B, the gene irp9 can convert chorismate into salicylate, from which the siderophore yersiniabactin is then synthesized. The pPHDP70 plasmid has a HPI similar to the HPI of  Yersinia , where a cluster of irp genes encodes the siderophore piscibactin. Furthermore, pPHDP70, along with pPHDP10, is widely present in  P. damselae  subsp.  piscicida . It is possible, therefore, that the chorismate mutase encoded on pPHDP10 plays a key role in the pathogenicity of  P. damselae  subsp.  piscicida  by providing the substrate that irp9 on pPHDP70 can convert to salicylate for the production of piscibactin, providing an explanation for the sustained co-presence of these two plasmids. In order to accomplish this, however, the tyrosine and/or @sm$ phenylalanine @/sm$ concentrations need to favour the reaction equilibrium in the reverse direction.	1
This experiment could not have been performed with an arabitol-negative @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ because gene deletion studies are currently not possible in this bacterium. C. glutamicum DeltamtlD is unable to grow with arabitol as sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source. Therefore, atlABCD genes from MGA3 were cloned into C. glutamicum expression vector pVWEx1, and the resulting vector pVWEx1-atlABCD was used to transform C. glutamicum DeltamtlD with the aim of restoring growth on arabitol. While the DeltamtlD mutant transformed with pVWEx1 empty vector was unable to grow on arabitol, heterologous expression of B. methanolicus MGA3-derived atlABCD genes from vector pVWEx1 allowed for growth with arabitol as sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source and led to complete arabitol consumption (Figure 4A). However, since C. glutamicum DeltamtlD still possesses the arabitol transporter rbtT, the possibility that the strain could still import arabitol via the native permease and that AtlD would subsequently take over its oxidation to xylulose could not be excluded. Therefore, we performed a complementation experiment in C. glutamicum DeltamtlD heterologously expressing the @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ atlD gene alone.	2
This finding does not rule out an additional regulatory role of Cys30 in an oxidative stress response superimposed on the primary zinc-sensing role of AdcR as recently proposed in @gm$ S. suis @/gm$. The physiological significance, if any, of redox chemistry occurring on Cys30 in S. pneumoniae AdcR remains unknown and contrasts sharply with bona fide MarR family members that sense @sm$ peroxide @/sm$ or other ROS stress via formation of higher oxidation states of cysteine.	3
This has not been explored for Egyptian   @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$   isolates, where agricultural antibiotic usage is poorly regulated and self-medication for gastrointestinal disease is common. Global differences in the use of @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ are also likely responsible for the geographical differences observed in @sm$ quinolone @/sm$ resistance.	4
This included SCFA, pyruvic acid and lactic acid, saturated fatty acids palmitic acid, and myristic acid - also an omega-6 FA, monounsaturated FAs, @sm$ oleic acid @/sm$ and palmitoleic acid, omega-3 PUFAs alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid (ALA+GLA) and EHA and DHA as well as, omega-6 Linoleic acid and arachidonic acid (Fig. 5a). There was some indication of a normalisation of individual inflammatory FA levels in recipients. SCFA, omega-3 & omega-6 PUFAs were altered in the direction of the donor following FMT (Fig. 6b). The relative ratios of detected anti-inflammatory omega-3 to pro-inflammatory omega-6 PUFAs in healthy donors was 1:1.3, for the @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ patient group this ratio was 1:1.8 and this ratio was altered post FMT to 1: 1.4.	2
This included bacteria known to degrade dietary plant @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ such as the Lachnospiraceae family (Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, Coprococcus_2 eutactus, Pseudobutyrivibrio spp., @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$) and from the Ruminococcaceae family (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus_1 bicirculans, Ruminococcus_2 bromii).	2
This is corroborated with previous work suggesting that this species, which is an important metabolizer of polysaccharides, increases in abundance in response to @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ exposure. Other identified associations for antibiotic exposure not previously reported include an increased Propionibacterium, Subdoligranulum species and a decreased abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ and Streptococcus lutetiensis (at 4-6 months).	3
This is in line with the fact that Abmb's closest structural homologs are the hemagglutinin components of @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ toxin (HA-33) and the Ricin B-like like lectin from C. nebularis (CNL). These two Abmb structural homologs share a similar @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-binding region and have a monovalent sugar binding mode; thus, the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ binding site of Abmb was postulated to resemble them.	3
This is possible by exploiting the electrostatic interaction between anionic xanthan gum and cationic @sm$ chitosan @/sm$. For example, Shu et al. dispersed @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ in xanthan gum hydrogel and extruded the blend into a @sm$ chitosan @/sm$ solution to obtain capsules, which improved the survival of @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ in milk. By alternating between xanthan gum solution and @sm$ chitosan @/sm$ solution, the amount of coating layers can be modified. The beneficial effect of an additional layer was shown for Lactobacillus acidophilus in xanthan-@sm$ chitosan @/sm$ capsules, resulting in a better control of the release as well as improved viability during storage in a dairy beverage and exposure to simulated gastric juice (Shu et al.,).	3
This localized tooth destruction is caused by organic acids produced from cariogenic bacteria in the dental biofilm through metabolizing the fermentable @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$. When the dental biofilm is changed by acidity and nutrients of the oral environment, dental caries is developed. The dental biofilm comprises complex microbial species embedded as colonies in the organic matrix. @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ (@gm$ S. mutans @/gm$) exist among the aggregated microbes in the dental biofilm, and it is considered the main pathogenic bacteria that cause dental caries.	1
This model includes 2826 metabolic and transport reactions, 2087 metabolites and 1411 genes, and provides the best available representation of @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ metabolism. The model accounts for reactions mimicking the exchange of up to 337 different metabolites with the environment. It can contemplate 220 metabolites as the sole carbon and energy source, and 105 metabolites as the sole @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ source, and can explain growth in rich media, such as LB (Nogales et al., 2017).	2
This potential is demonstrated by lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum, as well as bacteria belonging to the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species. Hyperhomocysteinemia often co-occurs with disturbances in lipid metabolism. Probiotic bacteria can effectively reduce cardiovascular risks by lowering Hcy levels and improving lipid profile parameters. There are several mechanisms postulated by means of which the microflora influences the lipid profile. These include participation of bacteria in the synthesis and transformation of bile acids into secondary bile acids and a reduction of cholesterol to @sm$ coprosterol @/sm$ in the gastrointestinal tract.	1
This result indicated that specific @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ or tyrosine suppression could lower the microbiota by an increase in competing taxa in the vancomycin-treatment gut. However, the levels of recovered uremic toxins at day 28 indicated the resilience of the taxa responsible for its generation in patients with ESRD. In addition, Blautia was associated with an early decline of renal function (eGFR decline). Although most of the direct functional evidence points to a role of the pathogenic Blautia and Oscillibacter in dysregulation of the host's inflammatory response, the commensal Blautia and Oscillibacter may represent the major proportion of the gut microbiome. We also detected an enrichment of Intestinimonas and Acetatifactor (both belonging to Firmicutes phylum) in the UUO rats. The two genera were both composed of only one OTU assigned to @gm$ Intestinimonas butyriciproducens @/gm$ and Acetatifactor muris, respectively. So far, a few studies have reported the presence of Intestinimonas and Acetatifactor, such as I. butyriciproducens in the mouse intestine and A. muris in the intestine of an obese mouse. The present study was the first to detect @gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$ and A. muris in the colonic lumen of a rat model of renal injury. Except for @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$, these taxa positively correlated with most of the plasma metabolites, such as kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 5-HTP, 5-HT, 3-HK, 5-HK, IS, p-CS, CDCA, and TUDCA, that exacerbated TIF in the UUO rats, confirming the results of our previous findings in patients with CKD.	2
This study also found that, under anaerobic conditions, P3UCO-S1 strain, an oral strain isolated from a patient with UC, had a significantly higher CFU in the presence of 5% @sm$ H2 @/sm$, as compared to 2.5% @sm$ H2 @/sm$ and 10% @sm$ H2 @/sm$. Under microaerobic conditions, this strain had a significantly higher CFU in the presence of 10% @sm$ H2 @/sm$ compared to 2.5% and 5% @sm$ H2 @/sm$. It appeared that the concentrations of @sm$ H2 @/sm$ supplied in bacterial cultivation affect the optimal growth of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$. This aspect should be further investigated by examining more @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains using systems that are able to supply fixed concentrations of CO2, N2, and @sm$ H2 @/sm$, which will provide useful information to clinical laboratories in isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from clinical samples.	2
This study broadens knowledge of the genomic basis of @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ pathogenesis and host specificity. The most interesting differences in the genetic repertoire of the subspecies relate to cell surface structures including the S-layer and @sm$ LPS @/sm$ and distribution of these genes is associated with certain pathotypes. This emphasizes the importance of surface-exposed structures to @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ pathogenicity and demonstrates how evolutionary forces optimize the fitness and host adaptation of these pathogens.	3
This study examined the antibacterial activities of a triclosan containing (Seal & Protect), a benzalconium containing desensitizer (Micro Prime), a @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ containing prophilaxy paste (Sultan Desensitizer), two @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ containing varnishes (Cavity Shealth and Ultra EZ), and a dentin bonding primer (All Bond). METHODS: The test materials were inserted in the wells of Muller Hinton agar plates inoculated with @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, Streptococcus salivarious, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The diameters of the inhibition zones produced around the materials were measured after 24 h of incubation. The results were analyzed by the Kruskal Wallis one way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney tests at a significance level of P<.05. RESULTS: Micro Prime Desensitizer containing benzalkonium chloride had the highest antibacterial effectiveness compared to other desensitizers used in this study. In addition, triclosan containing Seal & Protect and acidic components containing All Bond showed very high antibacterial efficacy. On the other hand, @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ within both varnishes had little antibacterial effectiveness. However a @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ component in a paste (Sultan Desensitizer) showed very high bactericidal effect.	3
This study examines the use of a covalently @sm$ selenium @/sm$-bonded peptide and phage that binds to the @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ F1 antigen for the targeting and killing of E. coli expressing this surface antigen. Using a Ph.D.-12 phage-display library for affinity selection of the phage which would bind the F1 antigen of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$, a phage displaying a peptide that binds the F1 antigen with high affinity and specificity was identified. @sm$ Selenium @/sm$ was then covalently attached to the display phage and the corresponding F1-antigen-binding peptide. Both the phage and peptides with @sm$ selenium @/sm$ covalently attached retained their binding specificity for the @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ F1 antigen. The phage or peptide not labeled with @sm$ selenium @/sm$ did not kill the targeted bacteria, while the phage or peptide labeled with @sm$ selenium @/sm$ did. In addition, the seleno-peptide, expressing the F1 targeting sequence only, killed cells expressing the F1 antigen but not the parent strain that did not express the F1 antigen. Specifically, the seleno-peptide could kill eight logs of bacteria in less than two hours at a 10-microM concentration. These results demonstrate a novel approach for the development of an antibacterial agent that can target a specific bacterial pathogen for destruction through the use of covalently attached @sm$ selenium @/sm$ and will not affect other bacteria.	3
This study further strengthened that @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ MM045 is a potentially effective bacterium that completely degrades high and low molecular weight of PAHs within 24 h. This bacterium has a wide environmental distribution despite non existing report on its PAHs degradation capability. Moreover, @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ MM045 has shown similar degradation pattern as those of Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Mycobacterium species. Furthermore, @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ MM045 as a single strain was observed to be more efficient than many PAHs degrading consortia previously reported. In a previous report, only 100 mg/L of @sm$ phenanthrene @/sm$ has been mostly degraded rapidly (97.5%) by Sphingomonas sp. within 24 h in optimised culture medium. Furthermore, 48% pyrene was reported to be rapidly degraded by Mycobacterium sp. after 72 h of incubation even with higher population of 1.5 x 106 cells/ml. This has further highlighted the good metabolic strength of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ MM045 in degrading PAHs, which might be previously endorsed from the contaminated environment.	1
This study investigated cryopreservation (-80 C) and lyophilization survival and storage stability (4 C for 3 months) of the strict anaerobic gut microbes Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Eubacterium hallii and Blautia obeum. To improve preservation survival, protectants sucrose and @sm$ inulin @/sm$ (both 5% w/v) were added for lyophilization and were also combined with glycerol (15% v/v) for cryopreservation. Bacterial fitness, evaluated by maximum growth rate and lag phase, viability and membrane integrity were determined using a standardized growth assay and by flow cytometry as markers for preservation resistance. Lyophilization was more detrimental to viability and fitness than cryopreservation, but led to better storage stability. Adding sucrose and @sm$ inulin @/sm$ enhanced viability and the proportion of intact cells during lyophilization of all strains. Viability of protectant-free B. thetaiotaomicron, @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ and F. prausnitzii was above 50% after cryopreservation and storage and increased to above 80% if protectants were present. The addition of glycerol, sucrose and @sm$ inulin @/sm$ strongly enhanced the viability of B.	3
This study investigated the effect of drying on membrane @sm$ lipid @/sm$ oxidation and stx expression in E. coli. @sm$ Lipid @/sm$ peroxidation was probed with C11-BODIPY581/591; and stx expression was assayed by quantification of GFP in @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ Deltastx2a:gfp:ampr. Treatment of E. coli with H2O2 oxidized the probe; probe oxidation was also observed after drying and rehydration. @sm$ Lipid @/sm$ oxidation and the lethality of drying were reduced when cells were dried with trehalose under anaerobic condition; in addition, viability and probe oxidation differed between E. coli AW1.7 and E. coli AW1.7Deltacfa. Desiccation tolerance thus relates to membrane @sm$ lipid @/sm$ oxidation. Drying also resulted in expression of GFP in 5% of the population. Overexpression of gfp and recA after drying and rehydration suggested that the expression of Stx prophage was regulated by the SOS response. Overall, C11-BODIPY581/591 allowed investigation of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ peroxidation in bacteria. Drying causes @sm$ lipid @/sm$ oxidation, DNA damage and induction of genes encoded by the Stx prophage in E.	3
This study investigates the antibacterial effects of erbium chromium laser at 2780 nm, silver nanoparticles, and erbium chromium along with silver nanoparticles on @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$ in comparison with @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$. In the present study, 90 extracted human single-rooted teeth were selected and standardized to a length of 15 mm. The canals were prepared by V-taper Gold rotary files and then incubated with @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ for 21 days. The samples were divided into four experimental groups including @sm$ hypochlorite sodium @/sm$, silver nanoparticle, erbium chromium laser, and erbium chromium laser along with silver nanoparticle groups. Results showed that there was a significant reduction in colony count for all groups after interventions. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the colony count for @sm$ sodium hypochlorite @/sm$ group in comparison with another groups, and this group showed the highest reduction of colony count. There was a significant difference between silver nanoparticles and erbium chromium laser groups in colony count. According to the results, the silver nanoparticles offered strong antibacterial effects on @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ and therefore can decrease bacterial colonies, while the use of the laser, despite the reduction of the bacterial colony, could not be sufficiently used for disinfection of root canal system.	3
This well-studied bacterial species has previously been linked with improved @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and cholesterol metabolism as well as healthy and Mediterranean diets. Moreover, the increase in the butyrate-producing @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ corroborates other studies on Mediterranean diets and also has been associated with beneficial effects on @sm$ glucose @/sm$ homeostasis.	1
Thoroughbred horses had a higher abundance of various beneficial commensal bacteria than Jeju horses, such as Clostridium_XIVb and Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, which produce butyrate as the primary energy source for colonocytes, Fibrobacteres which digest plant fibers in the herbivore intestine, and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$2 from the Ruminococcaceae family, a @sm$ cellulose @/sm$-degrading bacterium in human intestine.	2
Those enzymes were part of the @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ biosynthesis from threonine and the TCA cycle. An in silico knockout of (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate hydrolyase which is in close genomic neighborhood to BP5 and catalyzes the second-to-last step in valine biosynthesis, led to a reduced metabolite production and concurrently increased metabolite consumption by @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ for the SIHUMIx community members.	2
Three @gm$ Porphyromonas @/gm$ species (@gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, P. endodontalis, and the novel species that is the subject of the present report, P. uenonis) are very much alike in terms of biochemical characteristics, such as enzyme profiles and cellular fatty acid contents. @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ is distinguished from the other two species by virtue of production of alpha-fucosidase and @sm$ glyoxylic acid @/sm$ positivity. The novel species is difficult to differentiate from P. endodontalis phenotypically and was designated a P. endodontalis-like organism for some time. However, P. endodontalis is recovered almost exclusively from oral sources and also grows poorly on Biolog Universal Agar, both characteristics that are in contrast to those of the other two organisms. Furthermore, P. uenonis is glycerol positive in the Biolog AN Microplate system. Both @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ and P. uenonis are positive by 13 other tests in the Biolog system, whereas P. endodontalis is negative by all of these tests. @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ grew well in both solid and liquid media without supplementation with 5% horse serum, whereas the other two species grew poorly without supplementation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed about 10% divergence between the novel species and P. endodontalis but less than 2% sequence difference between the novel species and @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$. Subsequent DNA-DNA hybridization studies documented that the novel organism was indeed distinct from @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$.	1
Three metabolites were found to have a high inter'omic centrality, including @sm$ adrenic acid @/sm$ and 2 unidentified metabolites, as a result of association with a group of co-correlated @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ OTUs, [Ruminococcus] gnavus, [Eubacterium] dolichum, Veillonella dispar, and Holdemania.	0
Three of the included studies, identified the types of oral @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ reducing species and correlated their abundance with plasma  changes (Burleigh et al.,; Vanhatalo et al.,; Liddle et al.,). The most abundant species emerged to be: Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella dispar, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria subflava, @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.	1
Three prominent compounds, @sm$ epigallocatechin @/sm$, methyl gallate, and quercetin were tentatively identified. Previous studies have shown the presence of these compound in Vachella species, and their biological activities have been demonstrated. screened the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of A. karroo against @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$. This study led to the isolation of epicatechin, beta-sitosterol and @sm$ epigallocatechin @/sm$, which reduced the viability of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ with a MIC value range of 0.03-0.500 mg/mL.	3
"Three saccaharolytic groups were further divided into nine subgroups by the fermentation patterns of sucrose, @sm$ lactose @/sm$, maltose and rhamnose. Two saccaharolytic subgroups were identified as Treponema socranskii, and two asaccharolytic groups were identified as ""T. denticola"" and ""@gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$""."	2
Three-day-old cultures of amoebae were washed in infection buffer (PYG 712 medium without tryptone, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, or yeast extract) and adjusted to 5 x 105 to 1.0 x 106 cells ml-1. PE phase AYE broth grown @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ harboring a plasmid conferring thymine prototrophy (pflaAgfp) were diluted in buffer and mixed with A.	2
Through enhancing the host immune responses (local and systemic), heat-inactivated Leuconostoc mesenteroides cells prevented @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ invasion into Caco-2 cells. Along similar lines, inactivated heat-killed yogurt prevent cytokine-induced barrier disruption in human intestinal epithelial cells. Inactivated L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus cells have been found to prevent colon and stomach cancer by reducing proliferative activity and improving cancer cell apoptosis. They can also lessen allergic rhinitis symptoms by maintaining cell wall integrity. In hamsters with allergic rhinitis, administration of heat-inactivated E. faecalis FK-23 cells increased the number of T-regulatory cells in the spleen and altered the body's immune responses. Heat-killed L. rhamnosus CNCM-I-3698 and L. farciminis CNCM-I-3699 exhibited coaggregation potential against foodborne pathogens, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, and @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$. It is noteworthy that the strongest coaggregation was mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction between the heat-killed strains and C. jejuni CIP 70.2 and resulted in inhibition of its attachment to intestinal tissues. Additionally, L. brevis cells have been shown to suppress the transcription of tumor necrosis factor, reduce the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and 2, and enhance the induction of heat-shocked protein in the gut. Lipoteichoic acid (@sm$ LTA @/sm$) is a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) expressed by Gram-positive bacteria and detected by the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expressed on the surface of gut enterocytes. Ligation of @sm$ LTA @/sm$ to TLR-2 initiates cellular signals, leading to induction of an inflammatory cytokine response. @sm$ LTA @/sm$ derived from probiotic Lactobacillus strains has anti-biofilm properties against oral and enteric pathogens, such as S.	3
Thus, the capacity of the human intestinal microbiota to convert apigenin-7-glucoside (A7G) has been proven in vitro by incubating A7G with fecal suspensions: apigenin, @sm$ naringenin @/sm$, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid are formed as the main metabolites. After application of A7G to germ-free rats, apigenin, luteolin, and their conjugates were detected in urine and feces. In human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats (comparatively to germ-free animals), @sm$ naringenin @/sm$, eriodictyol, phloretin, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid were also formed in their free and conjugated forms. Furthermore, when apigenin is studied under culture conditions mimicking the ascending colon, it modifies the multiplication and gene expression of the Enterococcus caccae bacterium, whereas no effect has been observed on @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$ and Lactobacillus rhamnosus G.	1
Thymidylate synthase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) from @sm$ methotrexate @/sm$-resistant @gm$ Streptococcus faecium @/gm$ has a UV absorbance peak at 259 nm and stains with acridine orange because of the presence of RNA on the protein.	4
Tigecycline, polymyxins, @sm$ carbapenems @/sm$, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tetracyclines (minocycline and doxycycline) are common antibiotics that have been used in combinations. Although colistin, tigecycline, and some aminoglycosides remain most likely to be active in vitro against @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae, current data do not reliably support the use of these agents as monotherapy for systemic infections. Antimicrobial combination therapy with these agents exhibiting synergistic effects might also be of benefit, and the investigation of further effective therapeutic regimens with various antibiotic combinations is warranted. However, most studies have been conducted to determine the in vitro activity of combination therapy against @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ carbapenemase (KPC)-producing @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$. Enhanced activity was noted following treatment with doxycycline combined with amikacin against KPC-producing @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ isolates in a recent study; however, other in vitro studies of the combination effect of an aminoglycoside-amikacin with doxycycline or tigecycline against multi-drug resistant E. coli are rare. The goal of this study was to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of the combinations of an aminoglycoside (amikacin) and doxycycline or tigecycline against ESBL-, @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$-resistant, New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)- and KPC-producing E.	4
To analyse phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) at Ser473, the mice administered with @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$, A. finegoldii and PBS (vehicle control) 3 times a week for 4 weeks were subjected to 6 h fasting before the insulin injection, and 0.85 U kg-1 human regular insulin (Eli Lilly) was subsequently administered from the inferior vena cava. The liver, epididymal fat (eWAT) and gastrocnemius muscle were subsequently collected 5 min after the insulin injection, weighed and snap-frozen by liquid @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$.	0
To assess the species of the genus Aeromonas in 178 strains isolated from human and animal materials and from the environment (water and hospital environment), examined along with 11 type strains of the best known species, a key was used the basis of which are in addition to biochemical tests defining the genus Aeromonas 12 tests: Voges-Proskauer, lysine decarboxylase, gas from glucose, haemolysis, @sm$ gluconate @/sm$ oxidation, elastase, arabinose, mannose, saccharose, salicine, esculine hydrolysis, arbutine. Three tests--salicine, esculine hydrolysis, arbutine--differentiate @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ (2-3 positive) from A.	2
To date, the bacteria responsible for @sm$ indole @/sm$ and p-cresol and production have not been fully determined. Recently, data showed that phenolic compounds like PCS/PCG are mostly generated by anaerobic microbial species, whereas indolic compounds like IS/IAA are produced by both aerobes and anaerobes. Some p cresol-producing bacteria in gut have been recently identified in previous studies including Clostridium difficile, @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ and Proteus vulgaris. However, our experimental study failed to detect these species in the mice fecal samples, suggesting that other bacteria are also involved in the production of PCS and PCG. Similarly, in the literature, Alistipes shahii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium. Nucleatum, and Bacteroides ovatus are @sm$ indole @/sm$-positive bacteria but we were not able to detect them.	1

To demonstrate the utility of this system, we focused on @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ N-acetylneuraminic acid @/sm$), a sugar liberated from the gut mucosa by sialidases expressed by certain commensal bacteria lacking the necessary enzymes for @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ catabolism. Free @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ is a nutrient source for the antibiotic-associated enteric pathogens @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ and Salmonella typhimurium, and can determine pathogen burden in mouse models. Mucosal glycoproteins carrying @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ also serve as viral receptors. Despite this broad importance, how commensal sialidase activity determines @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ levels in the gut lumen is unexplored. While a healthy microbiota has been reported to produce low levels of free @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$, at least one antibiotic formulation alters the community to increase luminal @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ concentrations, creating a pathogen-sensitive state. It is unknown whether antibiotic-induced @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ release reflects a specific reconfiguration of the microbiota dependent on the initial community composition and antibiotics used, or instead is a result of fundamental properties of this microbiome-host interaction.	2
To determine if the released compounds (including metabolic byproducts and PBPs) from BU could impact butyrate producer growth, we characterized the growth of butyrate producers in BU conditioned @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media. To eliminate the effect of external pH modification, the pH of the conditioned @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media was adjusted to match fresh media (Figure S8A). We computed the ratio of total growth (area under the curve or AUC) of each butyrate producer in conditioned @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media (AUCCM) to the corresponding fresh media (AUCFM). This metric showed that the conditioned @sm$ glycan @/sm$ media enhanced the growth of butyrate producers across many conditions. For instance, a growth benefit for all butyrate producers was observed in conditioned inulin or laminarin media, whereas a negligible growth benefit was observed for other conditions such as @gm$ CC @/gm$ in conditioned xyloglucan media (Figure S8B and Supplementary Data 5). Therefore, our results demonstrate that the effect of released compounds from BU on the growth of each butyrate producer was determined by the specific @sm$ glycan @/sm$, consistent with the @sm$ glycan @/sm$-dependent variation in the inferred inter-species interaction networks of the communities (Figure 5B).	2
To determine potential adaptations to a higher human intake of complex carbohydrates after the advent of farming and a greater use of antibiotic substances in the modern human lifestyle, we then assessed TS-1, TS-2 and @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and CAZyme families. As a result, we could not detect genetic traces related to antimicrobial resistance in the genomes. On the other hand, we found a total of 10 CAZy families in the gene pool of TS-1, TS-2 and @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, six of which are common to these three species (Additional file 1: Figure S15). These family members are involved in either assembling or breaking down complex carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose and @sm$ chitin @/sm$) (Additional file 2: Table S18).	2
To determine the relationship between EC apoptosis and the presence of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ cells, we performed ex vivo experiments using the vaginal ECs of selected healthy subjects that were treated with @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ clinical isolates from three women enrolled in this study. Given that BV can be considered a biofilm infection primarily consisting of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, we evaluated the biofilm-forming ability of the three @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ clinical isolates (designated GV 1, GV 2, and GV 3) under our experimental conditions. To this end, the strains (108 CFU/ml) were incubated for 48 h and biofilm formation on an abiotic surface (@sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ plates) was analyzed by CV staining, as described in the Methods section.	0
To determine whether @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$-induced inflammatory responses were dependent on MAPK signaling, we monitored MAPK activation in macrophages. Although these three strains induced phosphorylation of p38, SAPK/JNK and ERK1/2, the 114R strain especially induced rapid and strong activation within 30 min (Fig. 4A and B). We next investigated the role of MAPK signaling in proinflammatory cytokine production induced by the 114R strain. As shown in Fig. 4C, pretreatment with specific inhibitors of JNK (SP600125), p38 (@sm$ SB203580 @/sm$), or MEK (U0126) caused significant inhibition of 114R-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p40 production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.	3
To evaluate the impact of @sm$ IBU @/sm$ on EC migration, a scratch assay has been performed. Data showed that early treatment of @gm$ Pg @/gm$-LPS-stimulated EC with @sm$ IBU @/sm$ significantly reduced their migration rate (42% decrease at 12 h; p < 0.05) (Figure 2C).	3
To evaluate the resistance trends of isolated strains, ciprofloxacin (CIP), ceftriaxone (CRO), meropenem (MER), gentamicin (GEN; relevant in case of @gm$ Citrobacter @/gm$ and Enterobacter spp.), and sulfamethoxazole/trimetoprim (SXT) were chosen as indicator antibiotics based on local antibiotic utilization data. In addition, susceptibility data for @sm$ doxycycline @/sm$ (@sm$ DOX @/sm$; relevant in case of @gm$ Citrobacter @/gm$ and Enterobacter spp.) was available for the first half (2008-2012) of the study period, and for fosfomycin (FOS), data was available for the second half (2013-2017) of the study period.	0
To expand the structure-activity relationship within this scaffold and further understand the role of indole in the antibacterial activity, we synthesized NQE derivatives with and without substituent at the carbon bearing the epoxide and tested their inhibitory activity against @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ ATCC 29213 (see Supporting Information, Table S3). Not surprisingly, we found that these compounds were significantly less effective in inhibiting @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ compared to their indole counterparts. Furthermore, the @sm$ quinones @/sm$ containing indoles were also relatively poor inhibitors (see Supporting Information, Table S4). Previously, Sieber and co-workers have reported aminoepoxycyclohexenones with higher MICs; one analogue with an indole tether was found to have good potency against @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$.	3
To further analyze the impact of sphingolipid-deficient @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ colonization on barrier function, we first looked at transcriptional levels of tight-junction proteins TJP1 and CLDN2 in the colon, but both remained unchanged between BTWT- and BTDeltaSPT-colonized mice (Fig. S3H, I). We then cultured colonic epithelial monolayers in vitro and used @sm$ lipid @/sm$ extracts from BTWT and BTDeltaSPT strains as stimulants. Comparing the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of monolayers after 24 hours, we observed no difference between monolayers stimulated with BTWT or BTDeltaSPT extracts (Fig. S3J). We next tested whether @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ sphingolipids altered the ability of monolayers to repair after injury by performing a calcium switch assay but found no difference in recovery between monolayers stimulated with BTWT or BTDeltaSPT extracts (Fig. S3K). Thus, the barrier dysfunction and inflammation seen in our in vivo data likely involves an immune component and more than only @sm$ lipid @/sm$-epithelial interactions.	0
To identify @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ genes involved in the microbe's resistance to cationic antimicrobial @sm$ peptides @/sm$, the strategy of random transposon mutagenesis with a Tn5 minitransposon was used, and the library was screened for detecting polymyxin B (PMB) susceptible mutants. The mutation responsible for PMB-sensitive phenotype and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure were characterized for the @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ strain KM218-A3. In this strain the mini-Tn5 was located in an open reading frame with the product homologous to the E. coli protein GmhB (82% identity) functioning as d-glycero-d-manno-heptose-1,7-diphosphate phosphatase. ESI FT ICR mass spectrometry of anions was used to study the structure of the unmodified LPS of Y. pestis KM218-A3, and molecules were revealed with the full-size LPS core or with two types of an incomplete core: consisting of Kdo-Kdo or Ko-Kdo disaccharides and Hep-(Kdo)-Kdo or Hep-(Ko)-Kdo trisaccharides. The performed complementation confirmed that the defect in the biological properties of the mutant strain was caused by inactivation of the gmhB gene. These findings indicated that the gmhB gene product of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ is essential for production of wild-type LPS resistant to antimicrobial @sm$ peptides @/sm$ and serum.	4
To identify genes unique to ESOS44-1 and shared by ESOS44-4, first, comparative genomic analyses were performed against the other nine @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates, with a total of 60 proteins found to be unique to ESOS44-1 (Fig. 4A; Additional file 1: Table S15). A substantial number of these unique proteins were found in syntenic groups, with two large regions corresponding to Prophage CP4-57 (region I) and proteins involved in @sm$ lipid A @/sm$ biosynthesis (region II) (Fig. 4A; Additional file 1: Table S15). @sm$ Lipid A @/sm$ modifications are important in modulating outer-membrane permeability, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, and host recognition, whereas prophage CP4-57 has been implicated in acid resistance, biofilm formation, and lactate utilization, suggesting that these elements may contribute to enhanced fitness of this isolate.	1
To identify the protective or worsening effect on liver damage, we administered four representative species-level bacteria belonging to Ruminococcaceae and Veillonellaceae-Ruminococcus faecis (@gm$ R. faecis @/gm$), R. bromii, Megamonas funiformis (M. funiformis), and Veillonella parvula (V. parvula) to C57BL/6 mice fed @sm$ methionine @/sm$- and choline-deficient (MCD) diets for 5 weeks (Fig. 8a). We demonstrated that @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ feeding decreased serum ALT and AST levels compared to sham feeding (Fig. 8b). No worsening effect was found in mice given M. funiformis and V. parvula. An alleviating effect of @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ on fibrosis was shown with H&E and Sirius red staining (Fig. 8c), and the histological severity of NAFLD induced by an MCD diet was significantly regressed in mice fed @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ (Fig. 8d, e). The mRNA expression of fibrogenic genes (Col1a1, Timp1, and a-SMA) was also downregulated in mice treated with @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ compared to untreated control mice fed an MCD diet (Fig. 8f). In parallel with the changes in biochemical and histological liver injury markers, the cecal levels of secondary bile acids (DCA and LCA) were also decreased by an MCD diet and increased by @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ treatment (Fig. 8g). To confirm the alleviating effect of @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ on liver damage in other mouse NAFLD models, we used a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) model which prevents body weight loss in mice and shows no insulin resistance, and a genetic leptin-deficient (db/db) model, which develops spontaneously diabetes and fatty liver with insulin resistance. In both models, @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ administration decreased ALT and AST levels (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, the liver ratio against body weight decreased only in db/db mice. Nevertheless, the fasting insulin levels in serum and insulin resistance measured by ipGTT in db/db mice were not affected by @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ treatment.	2
To investigate the adaptation responses of @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ to NAg, Ag+ (supplied as AgNO3) and the model antibiotic Nx, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antibacterial agent was first determined against strain @gm$ ATCC 19606 @/gm$. From our dose-dependent growth inhibition studies, the MIC was observed to be 1 mug/mL for NAg and 2 mug/mL for Ag+ (Fig. 1A). NAg and Ag+ are known to target cell envelopes, which, in the case of Gram-negative bacteria, such as @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$, involves damage to phospholipid moieties in their outer and inner membranes. The targeting of the inner membrane is thought to disrupt bacterial respiratory components (embedded within the membrane). For instance, Ag+ can form complexes with electron donor groups in proteins (e.g., thiol and @sm$ amine @/sm$ groups), including those that are present in the respiratory enzyme NADH dehydrogenase. This membrane-targeting activity likely causes electron leakage from respiratory components, which can result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further damage biomolecules, including DNA, lipids, and other proteins. Although there are some similarities, studies have shown that NAg exerts unique antimicrobial mechanisms, compared to Ag+. In an aqueous environment, NAg can undergo oxidative dissolution and release Ag+ ions that can interact with various moieties (including halides, sulfides, and organics) and transform into other distinct silver species, each with its own toxicity. Previous studies have shown that Ag+, in general, exerts a higher extent of antibacterial activity, compared to NAg, as the activity of the nanoparticle is determined by its physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, and surface charge. Our results, however, are indeed consistent with the reported NAg MICs of 0.39 to 2.5 mug/mL on @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$, as well as with one Ag+ study that reported a MIC of 4 mug/mL.	3
To investigate the potential relationship between gastrointestinal microbiota and meat quality traits, we performed a Spearman correlation analysis on the different microbiota present in different gastrointestinal tracts and @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ content. The results revealed interesting associations. Specifically, within the rumen, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Oscillibacter sp. PEA192, and @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$ showed significant positive correlations with C12:0 fatty acid, while Methanobrevibacter millerae displayed a negative correlation with C12:0 (Fig. 6A). Moving to the duodenum, Solibacillus silvestris, and Advenella mimigardefordensis exhibited significant negative correlations with C12:0, whereas Mycobacterium dioxanotrophicus showed a positive correlation with C12:0 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, in the colon, several bacteria, including Bacteroidales bacterium CF, Bacteroides coprosuis, and Solitalea canadensis showed significant negative correlations with C12:0 (Fig. 6C). Additionally, Bacillus subtilis was found to be negatively correlated with C16:0. These findings provide insight into the potential impact of certain bacteria on the @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ and thus meat quality.	2
To investigate the role of protein folding in the second step, one or more @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ residues were introduced and the mutant proaerolysins were expressed in @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ and Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Vibrio cholerae.	2
To investigate whether @gm$ Fn @/gm$ can adhere to and invade macrophages, human THP-1-derived macrophages (dTHP1) were treated with live @gm$ Fn @/gm$ bacteria at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10:1 (bacteria:cells) and were incubated with the conventional cell culture method at 37  C with 5% CO2. Bacteria invasion assays were carried out using an antibody-based differential staining method, all invasion experiments were performed under the aerobic condition. The specific immunofluorescence staining of @gm$ Fn @/gm$ bacteria was confirmed by using mouse and human @gm$ Fn @/gm$ polyclonal primary antibody respectively (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1a, bacteria inside the cells were labeled with Cy3 (red), whereas @gm$ Fn @/gm$ bacteria external to the host cell were labeled with both Cy3 and @sm$ FITC @/sm$ (green, appearing yellow when channels were merged). Intracellular @gm$ Fn @/gm$ were distributed mainly around the cell nucleus, and exhibited obvious morphological changes into short rod or spheres shapes in the cytoplasm of dTHP1 cells, whereas extracellular @gm$ Fn @/gm$ showed normal fusiform rod shapes (Fig. 1a). In contrast, heat-killed @gm$ Fn @/gm$ were not observed to enter host cells (Fig.	0
To overcome these challenges, a coassembly of the M13 virus, cyanine 3 dye, and @sm$ silver @/sm$ nanoparticles is developed to create a fluorescent tag capable of binding with molecular precision with high emissivity. Enhanced emission of cyanine 3 of up to 24-fold is achieved by varying nanoparticle size and particle-fluorophore separation. In addition, it is found that the fluorescence enhancement increases with increasing dye surface density on the viral capsid. Finally, this highly fluorescent probe is applied for in vitro staining of @gm$ E. coli @/gm$.	3
To probe the relationship between the @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ being compared and members of the fecal consortium, various @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ were added, including some utilizable by @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ and others utilizable only by members of the fecal consortium. These @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ included N-acetylneuraminic acid, d-fucose, d-galactosamine, d-panose, d-galactose, GalNAc, and as a control, d-glucose.	2
To reveal the association of gut microbial balance with clinical biochemical parameters of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ metabolism, the selbal algorithm was applied to search for a microbial signature that could predict glucose intolerance. Alistipes onderdonkii and Bacteroides plebeius were the top-ranked species related to basal @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level during OGTT (Figure 4d, left). The analysis further demonstrated that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the most frequently observed species in the balance for blood @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels at 1- and 2-hours during OGTT (Figure 4d, middle and right panels). The ratio with lower abundance of species such as Bacteroides cellulosilyticus in the denominator to higher abundance of species such as Alistipes onderdonkii in the numerator was associated with fasting @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels (R2 = 0.285, Figure 4e, left). Consistently, the ratio of gut microbial species with lower abundance (such as Bacteroides coprophilus and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) to gut microbial species with higher abundance (such as Megamonas unclassified and Ruminococcus gnavus) showed close association with 1-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level (R2 = 0.406, Figure 4e, middle). Likewise, the ratio of microbial species with lower abundance (such as @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) to microbial species with high abundance (such as Megamonas unclassified and Bacteroides eggerthii) was associated with 2-hour @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level during OGTT (R2 = 0.375, Figure 4e, right). Hence, the balance of specific microbial species was associated with clinical parameters of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ tolerance during the second trimester of pregnancy.	3
To test the compatibility between the water treatment and filter-capture, the best performing treatment methods based on the pre-treatment results (zeolite, silica pellets 500 microm, @sm$ activated carbon @/sm$ with milk coating, and the Chelex-100 treatment) were used in a post-treatment setting (Figure 2, post-treatment tests); the results are shown in Table 5. Despite promising results during pre-treatment testing, the QEs from the post-treatment strategies were either low (<60% and lower for zeolite-TWC-ZL, @sm$ activated carbon @/sm$ with milk protein-TWC-AC/MP, and Chelex-TWC-CX treatments, Table 5) or highly variable (30-100%, silica pellets-TWC-Si5.2, Table 5). Considering the significant drop of the QE between the pre- and post-spike samples, it was speculated that the C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ cells may be retained by the highly porous @sm$ activated carbon @/sm$ and zeolite matrix or caught in the tightly packed Chelex and silica resins, preventing accurate enumeration.	3
To understand the mechanism underlying the observed behavioral improvement, we analyzed the effects of @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ CCFM1067 on neurotransmitters and their metabolites in PD mouse striata. HPLC experiments demonstrated that MPTP therapy drastically decreased the levels of DOPA (Figure 2H, T (8) = 12.07, p < 0.0001), DA (Figure 2I, T (8) = 15.54, p < 0.0001), DOPAC (Figure 2J, T (8) = 13.47, p < 0.0001), 5-HT (Figure 2K, T (8) = 3.836, p = 0.0050), 5-HIAA (Figure 2L, T (8) = 3.594, p = 0.0070), and @sm$ HVA @/sm$ (Figure 2M, T (8) = 5.336, p = 0.0007) in the striatum. Supplementation with @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ CCFM1067 enhanced striatal DOPA (F (2,12) = 27.45, p = 0.0067) and 5-HT (F (2,12) = 15.94, p = 0.0009) levels, and dramatically increased those of DA (F (2,12) = 36.39, p < 0.0001) and DOPAC (F (2,12) = 45.03, p < 0.0001) in mice with PD (Figure 2H-K). However, the decrease in 5-HIAA and @sm$ HVA @/sm$ (Figure 2L,M; p > 0.05) caused by MPTP was not affected by L-DOPA or @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ CCFM1067 treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ CCFM1067 reduced the neuropathological changes and glial activation caused by MPTP and restored the normal levels of neurotransmitters in PD mice.	1
To validate the statistical correlations between @sm$ GABA @/sm$ and the discriminatory bacterial species, human isolates were grown in the presence of four different metabolites involved in the @sm$ GABA @/sm$ pathway (Fig. 4b). Specifically, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. longum subsp. infantis, @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$, B. scardovii, C. difficile, and C. bolteae were cultured under anaerobic conditions in cell culture medium supplemented with either @sm$ GABA @/sm$, glutamate, putrescine, or spermidine.	2
Together with the main regulator of the ECL cell, gastrin, CgA may be used in the diagnoses of autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, which is the main factor in gastric cancer whether induced by @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ or autoimmunity. Moreover, CgA reflects 24-h gastrin better than fasting morning gastrin in patients treated with proton pump inhibitor once daily. The new group of inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, the @sm$ potassium @/sm$-competitive acid blockers represented by vonoprazan seem to be more efficient in inhibiting acid secretion, but as was to be expected, similarly induce more hypergastrinemia. Thus, vonoprazan should be reserved for only short-term treatment where profound acid inhibition is required, such as for @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ eradication or acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.	3
Treatment with various antibiotics such as cephalexin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ altered the normal bacterial microbiota of infants increasing the percentage of potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and lowering the amount of bacteria like Bifidobacteriaceae, Bacilli, and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ which are part of the healthy microbiota.	3
Treponema denticola, @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ and Treponema socranskii produce an enzyme that hydrolyses hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS). The secreted enzyme is specifically inhibited by gold sodium thiomalate and anti-bee-venom antibodies. The use of saturated substrate (HA or CS) transblots allowed the visualization of active enzyme directly from culture supernatants and is a useful tool in clarification of complex @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$-degrading enzyme specificities.	1
Trimethoprim, @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$, chloramphenicol, minocycline, levofloxacin, tobramycin, ceftazidime, amikacin, and meropenem were examined as clinically relevant antibiotics (see Table 2 for the concentrations used). Essentially, molten BSMG agar was cooled to 50  C and two AST discs were equally spaced in a 9 cm plastic Petri-dish prior to plate pouring and then adjusted so that they were beneath the agar using sterile forceps before the agar set. Antibiotic plates were streaked with two B. ambifaria (AMMD, BCC0191) and two @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ strains (BCC0238, BCC1697) in duplicate, incubated at 30  C for 72 h.	3
Twenty-six strains were positive for @sm$ HCN @/sm$ (Figure 3). The highest activity was observed with Bacillus paramycoides LMR1182, followed by five strains of Bacillus (Bacillus altitudinis LMR1175, Bacillus cereus LMR1176; LMR1177 and LMR1178, and Bacillus pumilus LMR1181), @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ LMR1163, and 3 strains of Stenotrophomonas rhizophila (LMR1210; LMR1211; and LMR1212). Bacillus subtilis LMR1184 and Microbacterium resistens LMR1189 showed medium production, while the remaining 14 strains showed poor @sm$ HCN @/sm$ production.	1
Two @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ isolates close to TY2482 were sequenced and studied: 2009EL-2050 and 2009EL-2071. We used MICRA with a subset of the single Illumina reads and the same reference genomes as the sequences used for the TY2482 isolate (Additional file 1: part 3-3). MICRA identified a new plasmid close to the E. coli LF82 plasmid for the 2009EL-2050 strain, which is specific to this strain. An interesting result was a difference between the two predicted resistance profiles: 2009EL-2050 was predicted to be resistant to the @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ whereas the 2009EL-2071 strain was predicted to be sensitive, which was observed by experimentally measured antibiotics resistance profiles. The MICRA comparison module was then used to rapidly compare the TY2482, 2009-2050, and 2009-2071 strains. A Venn diagram (Fig. 3d) showed that the three strains share a large number of CDSs and that the two 2009EL strains share more CDSs. Among the CDSs shared between TY2482 and 2009EL-2050, the tetA gene implicated in the @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance was retrieved by MICRA.	4
Two @sm$ phenols @/sm$, pyrocatechol (82) and pyrogallol (84) a structural constituent of many polyphenols were screened against periodontopathic bacteria, and pyrogallol showed high antibacterial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$.	3
Two different minimal medium formulations were used in the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ growth arrays (Table S1a lists the formulation used for each isolate). The simpler of the two formulations (medium 1) was identical to the above MM, except that no @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ were included and the medium was prepared at a 2x concentration. The second minimal medium formulation (medium 2) was identical to medium 1 but included beef extract (0.5% [wt/vol] final concentration) as an additional supplement. We initially attempted to cultivate all of the species tested using only medium 1 but determined that beef extract was specifically required to allow the growth of some species, especially Parabacteroides spp., Barnesiella intestinihominis, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, and the branch of Bacteroides that includes Bacteroides plebeius and B. massiliensis. Growth in the absence of an added @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ source was generally not observed or very low, except with Parabacteroides that were often able to grow to a low level on the added 0.5% beef extract. The corresponding negative-control wells for each strain assayed were averaged, and this value was subtracted from the total growth calculation of the corresponding to strain on other @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ tested (all raw growth curves are provided as source data).	2
Two fluorophores, a pH-sensitive and a pH-insensitive one are immobilised at the bottom of a @sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ 96-well microtitre plate. The pH-insensitive fluorophore serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. The sensor measures pH accurately in optically well-defined media. Particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. Despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type and in inoculum sizes of cultures of Lactococcus lactis and of @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ at 30 and 37 degrees C.	0
Two homosexual men were colonized in the urethra with @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ nonsusceptible to ampicillin (MIC, 8 mug/ml), @sm$ amoxicillin-clavulanate @/sm$ (MIC, 4 mug/ml), cefotaxime (MIC, 1.5 mug/ml), cefepime (MIC, 3 mug/ml), meropenem (MIC, 0.5 mug/ml), cefuroxime, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol (all MICs, >= 32 mug/ml). Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) showed that the strains were indistinguishable. The isolates had amino acid substitutions in PBP3, L4, GyrA, and ParC and possessed Mef(A), Tet(M), and CatS resistance mechanisms. This is the first report of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$.	4

Two important geniuses belong to this family: @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, proposed by Hills et al. as a marker of intestinal dysbiosis. Ruminoccocus genus and its representative were decreased in intervention studies and during sports preparation . The second genus that belongs to the Ruminaceae family is Oscillospira, which is closely related to human health and lean individuals. The abundance of Oscillospira positively correlates with microbial diversity, high-density lipoproteins, and sleep-time duration, and is inversely correlated with blood pressure, fasting @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels, triglycerides, and uric acid.	0
Two other GMMs for propionate production (II and IV) were found to be active in @gm$ C.catus @/gm$ and A.soehngenii, respectively. The propionate production module II occurs via the consumption of lactate and is active in @gm$ C. catus @/gm$, while propionate production IV proceeds via the 1,2-PD pathway, which is active in A.soehngenii. D-lactate is utilized by @gm$ C.catus @/gm$, whereas A.soehngenii can utilize both D- and L-lactate. In the Db-MM, we incorporated the potential for this cross-feeding by including multiple species (A.rectalis, B.ovatus and B.xylanisolvens) capable of producing lactate and multiple species capable of utilizing lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ to produce either butyrate (by A.soehngenii) or propionate (@gm$ C.catus @/gm$).	2
Two samples from ER harbored simultaneously different strains (VP734 strains 5 and 12; VP1048 strains 1 and 6), and a discrete number of strains showed unusual characteristics, being sucrose positive on TCBS (5.9%), producing gas or H2S on Kligler Iron Agar (KIA) (14.7%), ornithine negative (32.4%), sensitive to O/129 10 mug (50%), ortho-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (ONPG) positive (8.8%), @sm$ citrate @/sm$ negative (26.1%), gelatinase negative (26.1%). The biochemical characteristics of isolates confirmed as @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, 20 from ER and 3 from SR, are reported in Table 2.	2
Two species of Alistipes were differentially associated with fasting @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels, with A. finegoldii displaying a negative relationship (p=0.04) while A. shahii had a positive relationship (p=0.03). A. shaii, A. finegoldii, Alistipes putredinis, and Bacteroides vulgatus were all negatively associated with fasting glycerol levels, but the association with A. shahii did not survive FDR correction. Four species, Streptococcus thermophilus, Eubacterium ramulus, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, and Roseburia hominis were associated with @sm$ glucose @/sm$ AUC after the OGTT challenge.	0
Two thousand three hundred and seventy strains of @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$, Sh flexneri, and Sh boydii isolated in England and Wales from 1974 to 1978 were tested for resistance to 12 antimicrobial drugs. Eighty per cent of strains were resistant to one or more drugs, with @sm$ sulphonamide @/sm$ resistance occurring most frequently. Resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol increased during the period, as did the incidence of multiple resistance. Most infections due to @gm$ Sh dysenteriae @/gm$, Sh flexneri, and Sh boydii are acquired abroad, and the increasing incidence of drug resistance among these organisms contrasts with the decreasing incidence of resistance among the indigenous Sh sonnei.	4
Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ were susceptible to cefotaxime and @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$. Antimicrobial susceptibility of S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were inconsistent. Across the study period, resistance to the four antibiotics tested (ampicillin, cefotaxime, @sm$ norfloxacin @/sm$, and co-trimoxazole) remained below 40% in both S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ isolates and do not appear to be increasing as of 2007. Figure 4 depicts the resistance of S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ strains to commonly used antimicrobials over time.	3
Typhi was found to be a major etiological agent of enteric fever in our patients followed by @gm$ S. Paratyphi A. @/gm$ Ceftriaxone was prescribed as the first line in hospitalized patients while in OPD it was @sm$ cefixime @/sm$.	3
Typhimurium and ETEC compared to @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ in response to ANE1. Regarding the bifidogenic activity of ANE4, it has previously been reported that the bifidobacterial genome encodes for various glycoside hydrolase families including alpha-L-fucosidases, thus enabling Bifidobacterium spp. to utilise fucoidan as a substrate. Furthermore, low molecular weight fucoidans from Laminaria spp. and Sargassum spp. were associated with improved Bifidobacterium spp. counts in a batch fermentation with human faeces and in a pure culture growth assay. All the above support our assumption that it is the fucoidan in the ANE4 that is principally responsible for the increase in @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ counts in the pure culture assay. The ability of some members of the Lactobacillus genus to partially utilise fucoidan from A. nodosum probably explains the minor increase in L. reuteri counts observed in this study. Based on the above, fucoidan was most likely the bioactive component in ANE1 and ANE4 associated with the antibacterial and prebiotic activities, with the variation between ANE1-4 attributed to structural alterations in this @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ due to the different extraction conditions of HAE methodology.	2
Typhimurium or @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ as described in Section 2.2 and then submerged into a sterile container containing 1 L of ClO2 made with HCl, lactic acid or @sm$ malic acid @/sm$ at concentrations of 2.5, 5 and 10 ppm. The submerged papayas were mildly stirred at a rate of 150 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the washed fruits were dried under a biosafety hood for 15 min. After drying, the marked surface was sterilely cut and homogenized in 25 mL of PBS + T buffer at 250 rpm for 1 min. The homogenate was serially diluted and plated by the agar overlay method with XLD and MOX agar for the selection of S. Typhimurium and @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, respectively.	3
Typical tibico grains are known to consist of @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ matrix that embeds a variety of bacteria and yeasts. These grains are widely used in some rural regions to produce a beneficial sugary beverage that is slightly acidic and contains low level of alcohol. This work aimed to characterize the microbiota composition of Chinese Tianshan tibicos using the single molecule, real-time sequencing technology, which is advantageous in generating long reads. Our results revealed that the microbiota mainly comprised of the bacterial species of Lactobacillus hilgardii, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Zymomonas mobilis, together with a Guehomyces pullulans-dominating fungal community.	1
UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is an important pyrophosphatase that reversibly catalyzes the synthesis of @sm$ UDP-glucose @/sm$ during glucose metabolism. We previously found that the deletion of UGPase may affect structure, growth, the virulence of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, and the activation of cellular NF-kappaB. However, the exact mechanism of activation of NF-kappaB regulated by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ UGPase is still unclear. Here, we found for the first time that UGPase can regulate the expression of virB proteins (virB3, virB4, virB5, virB6, virB8, virB9, virB10, and virB11) of type IV secretion system (T4SS) as well as effectors (vceC, btpA, btpB, ricA, bspB, bspC, and bspF) of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ by promoting the expression of ribosomal S12 protein (rpsL), BMEI1825, and quinone of 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (topA) proteins, and further inhibits the activation of cellular NF-kappaB and affects the virulence of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism used by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ to escape the immune recognition, which is expected to be of great value in the designing of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ vaccines and the screening of drug targets.	1
Unclassified thermophilic @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp. have been frequently recovered from various surface water types and sources in Canada. Here, six Campylobacter sp. isolates recovered between 2014 and 2015 from the surface water of two agricultural watersheds located at the South Nation River Basin east of Ottawa, Ontario, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Water samples were filtered through 0.47-mum membranes and the filters incubated in modified Preston broth (Oxoid, Lenexa, KS, USA) containing polymyxin B, rifampin, trimethoprim, and amphotericin B at 42 C under microaerophilic conditions (5% O2, 85% @sm$ N2 @/sm$, and 10% CO2) for 48 h. The enriched samples were streaked onto modified Karmali agar (Oxoid) containing the same antibiotic supplement and incubated under the above-mentioned conditions. For WGS, the isolates were grown on modified @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ blood-free selective agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or BD BBL Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under the same conditions described above.	3
Under AFNOR standard conditions (15 minutes) only phenolic complex and @sm$ glutaraldehyde @/sm$ solution were bactericidal for all strains including M. tuberculosis. Another series of test with contact during 30 minutes showed that with aldehyde and quaternary ammonium compounds bactericidal activity was limited against M. fortuitum and @gm$ M. chelonei @/gm$ and nearly non existent at usual concentrations against M.	4
Under this assumption, we are interested in whether the same species of bifidobacteria isolated from mother-infant pairs present a distinction in their hydrolysis of plant-derived @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$. RESULTS: Among the 36 Bifidobacterium strains, bifidobacterial @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ utilization showed two trends related to the intestinal environment where the bacteria lived. Compared with infant-type bifidobacterial strains, adult-type bifidobacterial strains preferred to use plant-derived glycans. Of these strains, 10 isolates, 2 Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (B. pseudocatenulatum), 2 Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B. pseudolongum), 2 @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ (@gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$), 2 Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve), and 2 Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum), were shared between the mother-infant pairs. Moreover, the repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) results illustrated that B. pseudolongum and @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ showed genotypic similarities of 95.3 and 98.2%, respectively. Combined with the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ fermentation study, these results indicated that the adult-type strains have a stronger ability to use plant-derived glycans than infant-type strains. Our work suggests that bifidobacterial @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism differences resulted in the selective adaptation to the distinct intestinal environment of an adult or breastfed infant.	2
Under this definition, there are only six described species of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ to date. Some species are cellulolytic, including the rumen isolates R. flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus, and the recently described human isolate Ruminococcus champanellensis, which is the only known bacterial species isolated from the human colon capable of degrading crystalline cellulose. Others are non-cellulolytic and utilize @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ like resistant starches in the case of R. bromii, or selectively use various plant hemicelluloses in the case of Ruminococcus callidus and '@gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$'. Substantial work has been done on cellulolytic @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ isolates from the bovine rumen due to their potential application in biofuels and their importance in animal health.	2

Universal primers were used to amplify approximately 600 bp of the hsp60 gene in the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. investigated. These primers H60F (5'-GG(ATGC)GA(CT)GG(ATGC)AC(ATGC)AC(ATGC)AC(ATGC)GC(ATGC)AC(ATGC)GT-3') and H60R (5'-TC(ATGC)CC(AG)AA(ATGC)CC(ATGC)GG(ATGC)GC(CT)TT(ATGC)AC(ATGC)GC-3') were designed by Rusanganwa et al.  on the basis of the conserved protein sequences GDGTTATV and AVKAPGFGD in HSP60. Amplifications were performed in 20 mul volumes with 1.5 muM of each primer (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany), 10 mul 2X HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix (Qiagen, Italy) (1,5 mM @sm$ MgCl2 @/sm$, 1 U Taq, 0.2 mM dNTP, final concentration) and 150 ng/mul DNA.	0
Unless stated otherwise, @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ isolates were grown in HIS broth (37 g/liter heart infusion broth [Oxoid], 5 g/liter yeast extract, 1 g/liter l-cysteine, 0.375% [wt/vol] @sm$ glucose @/sm$) or on HIS agar (HIS broth with 15 g/liter agar) at 37 C in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.) in an atmosphere of 10% H2, 10% CO2, and 80% N2.	2
Untreated negative controls as well as 0.2% @sm$ chlorhexidine @/sm$-treated positive controls were used. All eight tested periodontal pathogens including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, @gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$, Slackia exigua, and Atopobium rimae and the aPDT-treated subgingival biofilm were eliminated over the ranges of 3.43-8.34 and 3.91-4.28 log10 CFU in the log10 scale, respectively.	3
Upon arrival at the laboratory, samples were stored at 4  C for next-day processing, which included decontamination using @sm$ N-acetyl-L-cysteine @/sm$ and sodium hydroxide and centrifugation before staining a sample from the deposit using Auramine-O phenol staining for fluorescence microscopy as the primary smear microscopy examination method. Regardless of smear microscopy results, pellets were inoculated into the liquid medium mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 culture system (BD Diagnostics, USA). Molecular genetic Genotype @gm$ Mycobacterium @/gm$ CM assay (Hain Lifescience, Germany) was utilized for @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ species identification following positive mycobacterial growth.	3
Upon estradiol stimulation, glycogen is deposited onto mature vaginal epithelium where it is metabolized to @sm$ glucose @/sm$ by the epithelial cells and bacterial enzymes. Lactobacillus was the first bacterial genus identified with the capacity to metabolize vaginal @sm$ glucose @/sm$ into lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and it is predominantly these H2O2-producing strains that thrive in low vaginal pH conditions. By maintaining low vaginal pH and producing H2O2, as well as by stimulating the immune system and preventing further colonization through competitive exclusion, healthy Lactobacillus populations protect the female reproductive tract from infection by opportunistic pathogens. Indeed, overgrowth of @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$, a harmful toxin-producing bacterium, has been associated with increased vaginal pH and loss of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus.	2
Upon the stimulation, we determined the SSI in all tested groups, the control group and low DO group, both either unstimulated (@sm$ PBS @/sm$ as control) or stimulated with inactivated @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ (Figure 5).	0
Use of antimicrobial agents also has been shown to affect in vivo and in vitro metabolism of @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ and production of equol. Sutherland et al. showed that antimicrobial agents from different classes had different effects on the in vitro metabolism of @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ by fecal bacteria from monkeys. Exposure of fecal bacteria to ceftriaxone did not affect metabolism of @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ by the cultures. Bacteria metabolizing @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ were eliminated after exposure to tetracycline. Treatment of cultures with ciprofloxacin enriched for the bacteria metabolizing @sm$ daidzein @/sm$. Cultures of fecal bacteria from monkeys treated with 4 microg/mL of ciprofloxacin metabolized more @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ than untreated cultures. Brown et al. also have shown that the use of antimicrobial agents affects the production of equol in human subjects. An antimicrobial susceptibility assay indicated that @gm$ Eggerthella sp. strain @/gm$ @gm$ YY7918 @/gm$, isolated from a human, that converts @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ and dihydrodaidzein to S-equol, was susceptible to aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and new quinolone antibiotics. Other factors affecting daidzein metabolism are short chain fatty acids and arginine. Both butyric acid and arginine enhanced the capability of Asaccharobacter celatus to metabolize @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ by more than four-fold.	1
Using N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-boranes as our borylation agents due to their stability under aqueous conditions, we quickly found that wild-type Rma cyt c readily promoted the desired B-H insertion reaction in living @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ cells, furnishing the corresponding enantioenriched organoborane product in 70% ee and 120 TTN. Directed evolution by targeting residues near the @sm$ heme @/sm$ cofactor furnished Rma cyt c V75R M100D M103T (BORR1), which provided the organoboron product in 2490 TTN and 95% ee.	1
Using flow cytometry, a total of 30 bacterial endosymbionts in protists were isolated from water, @sm$ carbon @/sm$ and surgical mask samples. Bacteria identified included Escherichia, @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ and Klebsiella. Different bacterial strains from each sample type were selected for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Three strains, @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ (@sm$ carbon @/sm$ and surgical masks, #4 and #22) and Aeromonas sp.	0
Using our transporter-led approach has also uncovered more fundamental insight into the @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ biology of the pathogenic Spirochaetes, organisms where @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ transport genes have been previously identified only once (namely, ST2/siaPQM genes in Treponema brennaborense; Fig. S4). The SiaT clade of ST5 transporters also includes a small sub-clade of highly similar transporters that occur in some species of the Spirochaete genus Brachyspira (Fig. 4). Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli B2904 and B. pilosicoli WesB are pathogens of pigs, birds and humans, respectively, and have recently been reported to catabolize Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc and adhere to @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$-rich mucin glycoproteins. By looking for homologues of SiaT transporters in these bacteria, we identified a full complement of sialocatabolic genes in two @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains (Fig. S7), and complete sets of nan genes scattered over different loci in the other species including B. hyodysenteriae (Figs S7 and S11), which is consistent with these species' reported use of @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ as a carbon source.	2
Using published data about isolation sites of the analyzed bifidobacteria we compared them with the predicted abilities of microorganisms to utilize @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/AOS (Supplementary Table S3). For instance, strains with the highest utilization capabilities (phenotype U123) were isolated from omnivore animals, such as pigs, marmoset and tamarin monkeys, and humans. These results are in agreement with the previous observation that bifidobacteria of monkey/human origin exhibit a higher number of GH genes in their genomes, which is likely caused by their adaptation to a diversified diet of their hosts. Additionally, since the primary source of @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/AOS are various plant polysaccharides it is expected that strains isolated from herbivorous organisms would also have rich @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/AOS utilization phenotypes. Among the studied bifidobacteria, B. saeculare was the only one strain of herbivore origin that was capable of utilizing both @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ and alpha- and beta-AOS. Two other herbivore-associated strains, B. magnum and @gm$ B. merycicum @/gm$, utilize @sm$ arabinose @/sm$/alpha-AOS and @sm$ arabinose @/sm$, respectively. In contrast, B. boum could utilize neither @sm$ arabinose @/sm$ nor AOS.	2
Using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, the isolated @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility according to the procedure described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and the antibiotics were selected following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute's recommendations (CLSI). The Muller-Hinton broth (Oxoid, CM0405) was inoculated with the isolated and purified @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ inocula after the turbidity had been adjusted to a McFarland's turbidity (2 x 108 CFU/mL) of 0.5. Afterward, 100 microL of the turbid broth was plated over the Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) surface where the antibiotic discs (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) were placed and incubated at 37  C for 24 h. ceftriaxone (CRO 30), cefotaxime (CTX 30), @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$ (@sm$ CAZ @/sm$ 30), imipenem (IPM 10), gentamicin (CN 10), tetracycline (TE 30), and chloramphenicol (C) were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, ciprofloxacin (CIP 5) was interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and streptomycin (S 10) was interpreted according to CLSI guidelines.	3
Using this technique, we were able to correlate production of the very important flavor compounds 2-methylbutanal, @sm$ 3-methylbutanal @/sm$, and 2-methylpropanal with various growth conditions. We found that the aldehydes were present in the culture broth only as transient metabolites. They were produced in the exponential growth phase, reached a maximum concentration when the culture became anaerobic, and then they rapidly disappeared from the culture medium. This general pattern was observed for three different strains of S. xylosus and @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$.	1
V29b not only grows on @sm$ methanol @/sm$, but is able to grow on other substrates, such as protocatechuate, monobutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate and diisodecyl phthalate. DBP degradation was reported by Sphingmonas sp. DK4 (5 mg/l) (Chang et al.), Pseudomonas fluorescens B-1(2.5 & 10) (Xu et al.), @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ (1000 mg/l) (Hashizume et al.), Corynbacterium nitilophius G11 (100 mg/l), R.	2
Vaccine strain @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis @/gm$ (S. Choleraesuis; S.C.) (ATCC 15480) was obtained from Bioresources Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Bacteria were maintained in L.B. plate and propagate in L.B. broth for using. B16F10 (mouse melanoma) and 4T1 (mouse breast cancer) cells were maintained in 10 cm Culture dish with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 1% Penicillin-@sm$ Streptomycin @/sm$ (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mug/mL @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$), 2mM l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum.	3
Varied resistance was observed in commonly prescribed antibiotics; 33-100% resistant to Ampicillin, @sm$ Tetracycline @/sm$, Cotrimoxazole, Sulfamethoxazole, Cefotaxime, Amoxicillin and Augmentin, and 0-28.6% resistance to Ciprofloxacin, Cefuroxime, Levofloxacin, Meropenem, Gentamicin and Nalidixic acid. Multidrug resistance was evident with @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ flexineri, Shigella Boydii, @gm$ Shigella Sonnei @/gm$, Salmonella group B and Salmonella Typhimurium.	4
Various @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus resist bile salts by producing the bile salt hydrolase (BSH), thus minimizing weight gain and also reducing the cholesterol, and @sm$ triglyceride @/sm$ levels in mice.	1
Various microbial constitutions possess different capacities to liberate @sm$ TMAO @/sm$. It can therefore be theorized that a greater quantity of @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ and elevated CVD risk will result from a higher TMA-generating dysbiotic bacterial constitution. For example, Prevotella human gut bacteria is associated with more circulating @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ compared to @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$.	1
Virus inactivation and pathogen destruction (@gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes) was reported for cold plasma as well as UV treatment (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Candida albicans). Additionally, a mild-heat treatment (65  C for 4 min) and UV-C (254 nm) treatment (15 min at pH > 12 or <3, 25 or 37  C) can be another alternative. An advanced oxidation process, where a combination of UV-C along with ozone, H2O2, @sm$ Cu @/sm$ etc.	3
WR (wheat + rye), WB (wheat + highland barley) and WO (wheat + oats) tended to generate lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$, which are related to Sutterella, Staphylococcus, etc. WQ (wheat + quinoa) induced high propionate and butyrate accumulation by consuming lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$, mainly through Roseburia inulinivorans, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ and Anaerostipes sp., etc.	2
WT and LLO-deficient @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ (isogenic strains DP10403S and DP-L2161) were grown overnight at 37 C in brain heart infusion (BHI). For cell or mice infections, bacteria were diluted 1/20 in BHI and grown at 37 C until OD600 = 0.7-0.8. Bacteria were washed three times and diluted in injectable grade @sm$ PBS @/sm$ (for animal infections) or in cell culture medium (for cell invasion). Mice were inoculated by tail vein injection with @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ (2 x 104 in 100 mul injectable grade @sm$ PBS @/sm$) on day 28. After 72 h, mice were euthanized and livers, spleens, and blood were collected. Organs were homogenized in @sm$ PBS @/sm$.	0
Wax D prepared from the P-6 strain of the scotochromogenic species of @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$ constituted 0.3% of the dry bacilli. In the acid hydrolysates, alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, and mesodiaminopimelic acid were found as amino acid constituents. Mannose, @sm$ galactose @/sm$, and glucosamine were detected by paper chromatography.	1
We also chose a Bacteroidetes protein from @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ (BcAzoR) representative of the second largest clade in the SSN, and a novel, second E. coli AzoR (Ec_2AzoR) (Figure 2a). We examined the cofactor utilization preferences of these novels recombinantly expressed and purified enzymes with the optically active azo reporter substrate Methyl Red (Supplemental Figure S1a). We compared them to two controls: EcAzoR, which utilizes both NADH and @sm$ NADPH @/sm$ as a hydride donor, and Staphylococcus aureus AzoR (SaAzoR), which exclusively uses @sm$ NADPH @/sm$. We found that the novel AzoR enzymes were able to use both NADH and @sm$ NADPH @/sm$ as cofactors (Figure 2b). While E. coli and @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ proteins exhibited greater catalytic activities with Methyl Red than the Firmicutes enzymes, these results confirm that the gut microbial proteins examined here are azoreductases and that they are not selective for nicotinamide cofactor hydride donor.	2
We also identified a 297 kb contig in Enterobacter kobei, a 318 kb contig in @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ VRES259 and a 281 kb contig in @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ VRES269 from long-read data (Fig. 3). All three contigs were identified as an IncHI2 type plasmid using in silico PCR. These carried heavy-metal-resistance genes for mercury, tellurium and arsenic, and conjugational transfer genes that facilitate plasmid transfer between different species of Enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 3b). A multidrug-resistance region similar to those found in Enterobacter cloacae (GenBank examples: CP012170.1, EU855788.1, CP008899.1) was also identified in this plasmid, which contained resistance genes for aminoglycosides [(aac(6')-IIc, aac(6')-Ib), ethidium bromide (emrE), @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ (arr2), quinolones (qnrA1), sulphonamides (sul1, sul2) and third-generation cephalosporins (blaSHV-12)]. This multidrug-resistance region was flanked by transposases, indicating the potential for excision and horizontal gene transfer (Fig. 4b). The shared plasmid had a common 280 kb region, which contained three SNPs between the Enterobacter kobei plasmid and the other two plasmids, and zero SNPs between the @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ plasmids.	4
We also observed an over-representation of pathways involved in the metabolism of @sm$ starch @/sm$ and sucrose, which suggest that GOS-metabolizing bacteria could also have the ability to use other prebiotics such as resistant starch. In fact, studies have reported increases in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ when @sm$ starch @/sm$ was used as prebiotic. A lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from pyruvate to lactate, and a lactate transporter from the LctP family were also over-represented in the prebiotic group. We also observed a significant over-representation of the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase [EC 3.2.1.85], an enzyme involved in the utilization of GOS that hydrolyzes the 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosides previously phosphorylated and translocated by PTS transporters. Otherwise, we did not observe significant changes in beta-galactosidases that are more commonly used by some lactic acid bacteria or by Bifidobacterium. This could be explained by the GOS90 fermentation by other species whose abundance was higher than Bifidobacterium and that use mainly the PEP-PTS system to ferment galactose, species such as Streptococcus, Lactococcus and some species of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, like L.	2
We carried out two different analyses based on the specificity of hydrolytic enzymes to determine whether the OS found in type-1 and type-2 aguamiel are either fructose or @sm$ glucose polymers @/sm$. For the first analysis, samples of accumulated aguamiel were subjected to dextranase treatment, as several lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. dextranicum, @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$, etc.) capable of synthesizing dextrans or isomalto-oligosaccharides from sucrose through glucosyltransferases have been described as agave endophytes.	1
We correlated metabolite concentrations with @sm$ MGS @/sm$ relative abundances (Suppl. Fig. 20) and focused on positive associations. We looked at species that correlated with multiple, different metabolites. Bacteroides coprophilus correlated with aminoadipic acid and acetate; C. comes with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-dodecenoate, and glutathione; F. prausnitzii with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; E. lenta with 5-dodecenoate and eicosatrienoic acid; B. eggerthii with 5-dodecenoate and eicosatrienoic acid; and @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ with acetate.	1
We demonstrated that the SWEs can be used as an alternative and non-methylotrophic raw material for cultivations of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ strains at 50 C. Out of 12 different wild type strains tested, strain MGA3 possessed the most favorable growth properties, tolerating up to 50% SWE (v/v) in the growth medium. The biological reason for why the SWE concentration could not be further increased (to 75%) without negatively affecting growth is not known. The increased salt content could possibly contribute to this effect, however other extracted compounds such as phenols could also impose a negative effect on cell growth. The @sm$ polyphenol @/sm$ content of the seaweed will likely vary between the seasons, where a higher content in fall than spring has been reported for S.	3
We developed a mouse model to compare the virulence of @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$ strains with (S-plus) and without (S-minus) surface array protein (S-protein) capsules. In adult HA/ICR mice pretreated with @sm$ ferric chloride @/sm$, the LD50 for S-plus strain 84-32 was 43.3 times lower than its spontaneous S-minus mutant 84-54. Seven strains of inbred mice were no more susceptible than the outbred strain. In contrast to the findings with Salmonella typhimurium by others, 3 X 10(7) CFU of strain 84-32 caused 90% mortality in C3H/HeN (LPSn) mice and 40% mortality in C3H/HeJ (LPSd) mice. High-grade bacteremia in HA/ICR mice occurred after oral challenge with S-plus @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ strains and continued for at least 2 d, but was not present in any mice challenged with S-minus strains.	3
We employed comparative structural modeling of the NEAT domain of @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ protein4 (Cb-p4) against the known structure of Ba-IsdX1. Figure 6A shows conservation of the NEAT immunoglobulin-like fold, comprised of the required eight beta-strands and the 310-helix. Phe-108, noted as a possible heme-iron coordinating residue, is located on the beta8-strand at the position comparable to the second @sm$ tyrosine @/sm$ in the conventional YXXXY heme-binding sequence (Figure 1). Using Coot modeling, superimposition of heme from Ba-IsdX1 into the Cb-p4 heme-binding pocket allowed a prediction of how heme could be coordinated within the heme-binding pocket, and also helped facilitate the identification of potential heme-coordinating residues. In Figure 6B (left panel), the distance between the farthest Phe-108 hydrogen and the heme-iron is predicted to be 4 A. While this is not optimal for Fe3+ coordination, the iron atom was not included in the heme molecule in our Cb-p4 model. Therefore, the distance between Phe-108 and the iron could be reduced when the iron atom is present, to a distance that would allow Phe-108 to be a heme-iron axial ligand. Also, as determined during an in silico analysis, phenylalanine (as well as cysteine, histidine, methionine and @sm$ tyrosine @/sm$) can act as heme-axial ligands. However, if Phe-108 is unable to coordinate heme-iron, there may be compensatory pi-stacking interactions between this residue and @sm$ Tyr @/sm$-29 on the opposite side of the heme, as well as further interactions between other Cb-p4 residues and heme, as discussed below.	1
We evaluated the genetic diversity of @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ isolates of different serotypes by macrorestriction analysis and elucidated possible relationships between the genetic background, expression of potential virulence traits, and source of isolation. Virulence traits included expression of serotype-specific @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular protein factor (EF), hemolysin activity, and adherence to epithelial cells. Macrorestriction analysis of streptococcal DNA digested with restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI allowed differentiation of single isolates that could be assigned to four major clusters, named A1, A2, B1, and B2. Comparison of the genotypic and phenotypic features of the isolates with their source of isolation showed that (i) the @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ population examined, which originated mainly from German pigs, exhibited a genetic diversity and phenotypic patterns comparable to those found for isolates from other European countries; (ii) certain phenotypic features, such as the presence of capsular antigens of serotypes 2, 1, and 9, expression of MRP and EF, and hemolysin activity (and in particular, combinations of these features), were strongly associated with the clinical background of meningitis and septicemia; and (iii) isolates from pigs with meningitis and septicemia showed a significantly higher degree of genetic homogeneity compared to that for isolates from pigs with pneumonia and healthy pigs.	3
We examined antimicrobial susceptibility and efflux systems in laboratory-derived mutants of @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ selected by culture on fluoroquinolone-containing plates. The mutants exhibited decreased susceptibilities to quinolones and several other antimicrobials. Mutations in the gyrA gene were not always found in the mutants. Accumulation assays revealed that intracellular enrofloxacin concentrations were significantly lower in the mutants compared with parent isolates. Increased expression of acrB mRNA can explain the decreased susceptibilities to several antimicrobials but not in the case of @sm$ carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone @/sm$ (@sm$ CCCP @/sm$). Decreased susceptibility to @sm$ CCCP @/sm$ may result from the increased expression of emrA mRNA.	3
We first aimed to determine the shortest incubation time for which reliable AST results can be obtained for @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$. Therefore, we performed disc-diffusion-based AST using a standard @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ inoculum (~1 x 108 CFU/mL originating from isolated colonies) and determined the inhibition zone diameters at different incubation times for a panel of potential therapeutic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).	3
We first determined by Triton X-114 phase-partitioning that native @gm$ TP @/gm$0326 possesses the amphiphilic character expected of a polypeptide containing an OM-spanning beta-barrel domain (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, 326P1-4+ and 326betaB partitioned exclusively into the aqueous and detergent-enriched phases, respectively. These results imply that the beta-barrel domain is solely responsible for the amphiphilicity of the native protein. To extend these findings, we compared the abilities of 326P1-4+ and 326betaB to incorporate into liposomes that simulate the phospholipid composition of the @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ OM; following incorporation, proteoliposomes and unincoporated proteins were separated on discontinuous sucrose gradients. Fig. 3C shows that 326betaB, as well as the OmpG and bacteriorhodopsin controls, representing both an OMP and an @sm$ IMP @/sm$, respectively, were recovered only from the top (liposome containing, TF) fractions, whereas 326P1-4+ was detected in the heavier bottom and middle fractions (BF and TF, respectively) containing unincorporated material.	0
We first investigated iron uptake of @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ under laboratory conditions. One strategy used by bacterial pathogens to overcome iron limitation imposed by the host immune responses is to produce low molecular weight, high-affinity iron chelators termed siderophores. @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ utilizes heme iron for growth in vitro, but does not produce any known siderophores. Consequently, @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ grows poorly in TYG media supplemented with 200 muM of the metal chelating agent bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS) (Fig. 2A). BPS acts as a buffer to chelate free iron and addition of small amounts of iron salts (10 muM) does not restore growth (Fig. S1A). This growth defect is rescued by addition of 200 muM @sm$ ammonium iron citrate @/sm$, indicating that the inability to access iron, and not other trace metals, was responsible for diminished growth (Fig. S1B). In contrast, S. Tm produces two catecholate siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin, and grows under iron-limiting, anaerobic conditions in vitro (Fig. 2A). Some bacterial species do not produce siderophores but instead utilize siderophores that are produced by other microbes, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as xenosiderophore utilization or siderophore piracy. We thus tested a small panel of enterobacterial siderophores for their ability to enhance growth of @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ in BPS-supplemented media. Consistent with a previous report, growth in BPS-supplemented media was restored by the addition of purified, iron-laden enterobactin or salmochelin (Fig. 2B; Fig. S1C), suggesting that @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ may acquire iron through xenosiderophore uptake.	2
We found Bifidobacterium longum, Eubacterium eligens and @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ to be more abundant in patients alive at 6 months after infusion when including all samples (Extended Data Fig. 7A), and Bifidobacterium longum after excluding high-risk antibiotic treated patients (Extended Data Fig. 7B). In contrast, peptidoglycan biosynthesis or @sm$ D-galactose @/sm$ biosynthesis pathways were more prevalent in the gut microbiome of patients that did not survive the first 6 months after infusion or experienced early disease progression (Extended Data Fig.	0
We found strong associations between specific taxa and key upregulated metabolites accompanying the onset of dental caries, especially @sm$ Lactate @/sm$ and DHAP. Specifically, strong associations were found between DHAP and Actinomyces and between Lactate, DHAP and @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Granulicatella (Figure 8).	1
We found that Agathobacter and Escherichia_Shigella were significantly positively correlated with LDL and @sm$ UA @/sm$ in serum; @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Parasutterella, Ruminococcus, and Oscillospiraceae_UCG-003 were significantly negatively correlated with CREA in serum. The potential beneficial genus @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Parasutterella, Ruminococcus, and Subdoligranulum were increased after H.	0
We found that CBLEB administration alleviated the enrichment of Streptococcaceae and the depletion of Eggerthellaceae, Adlercreutzia, @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$, Fournierella, and Romboutsia in the gut of immunocompromised SP-infection rats. Some of these microbes have been reported to have important physiological or pathological functions. For example, members of the genus @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ have been recognized as beneficial microbes since they produce butyrate and contribute to the homeostasis of bile acid and @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$, and alterations in Eubacterium spp. have been linked with various human diseases. Correspondingly, we found that the colon-expressed genes that positively correlated with @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ were significantly enriched in the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway, while the lung-expressed genes that negatively correlated with this bacterial taxon were enriched in the measles, inflammatory bowel disease, cell adhesion molecule and TNF signalling pathways.	1
We found that Prevotellaceae UCG-001 and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ in the cecum were highly positively correlated with BFT and IMF. Prevotellaceae UCG-001, a strain of Prevotella with enzymes that can degrade cellulose and xylan, is also considered a beneficial bacterium. Prevotellaceae UCG-001 is significantly enriched after feeding inulin to mice, thus alleviating glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. In chickens, increased Prevotellaceae UCG-001 in the cecum was correlated with improved laying performance and egg quality in hens. @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ has been relatively comprehensively studied and is involved in @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism via its bacterial type II fatty acid biosynthesis system for producing saturated fatty acids <= 16 carbons.	1
We found that a higher adherence to a healthy dietary pattern reduced the risk of type I CRC (dominated by @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and Lachnoclostridium) and type II CRC (dominated by @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium), but not type III CRC (characterized by Prevotella 9). This suggests that enterotypes modify the diet-CRC risk association. A possible explanation is that enterotypes metabolize dietary components differently into compounds that affect CRC development. For example, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Lachnoclostridium and Faecalibacterium produce SCFAs from fiber fermentation, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic effects in the colon. Prevotella 9 produces @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ (@sm$ TMA @/sm$) from choline and carnitine, which converts to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver and promotes inflammation and oxidative stress in the colon.	1
We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes, @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ on resected ileal Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ we analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ in both in vitro (cellular models) and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (@sm$ TNBS @/sm$)-induced] colitis in mice. In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation by @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of @sm$ TNBS @/sm$ colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with @sm$ TNBS @/sm$ colitis, as demonstrated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and @sm$ TNBS @/sm$ colitis models, partly due to secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ as a probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.	3
We found that the samples from atherosclerotic patients in both cohorts were depleted in Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Eubacterium eligens, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$, and Roseburia intestinalis. At the functional level, healthy metagenomes were both enriched in pathways of starch degradation V, glycolysis III (from @sm$ glucose @/sm$), CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and folate transformations. @gm$ R inulinivorans @/gm$ and R intestinalis are major contributors to starch degradation V, while E eligens greatly contribute to the pathway CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and B xylanisolvens and B uniformis contribute to folate transformations II. The 11 marker species selected from the Chinese cohort distinguish patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.86. Strain-level microbial analysis revealed a geographically associated adaptation of the strains from E eligens, B uniformis, and E coli. Two gut microbial metabolites, nicotinic acid and hydrocinnamic acid, had significantly higher predicted abundance in the control samples compared to the patients in the Chinese cohort, and interestinglynicotinic acid is already an effective lipid-lowering drug to reducing cardiovascular risk. Our results indicate intestinal bacteria such as B xylanisolvens, E eligens, and @gm$ R inulinivorans @/gm$ could be promising probiotics and potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.	2
We found the lowest common taxon for this strain and confirmed that ASV2136 and ASV2107 were @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$. Then, we searched 283 @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ genomes in the PATRIC database to identify whether there are genes belonging to biotin metabolism and @sm$ lipoic acid @/sm$ metabolism in the genomes of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$.	0
We have also reported that monocolonization with a butyrate-producing Clostridial strain, @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$, mimicked the effects of the healthy microbiota and prevented an anaphylactic response to a food allergen. @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ is non-motile and does not produce @sm$ indoles @/sm$ (major AhR ligands).	0
We have earlier showed that culture supernatant of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ increases the production of @sm$ ROS @/sm$ by PBL of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Subramani et al., 2016b). Vaccinating Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus with heat-killed @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ resulted in a strain dependent modulation of @sm$ ROS @/sm$ production by PBL (Subramani et al., 2016a).	1
We have previously reported that Prevotella intermedia strain 17 isolated from a chronic periodontitis lesion produces a large amount of @sm$ mannose @/sm$-rich EPS and forms biofilm. The strain 17 induced highly noticeable abscess lesions in mice at 107 CFU, but non-EPS-producing @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ strains @gm$ ATCC 25611 @/gm$ or 17-2, a naturally occurring variant of the strain 17, required 100-fold more bacteria (109 CFU) in order to induce detectable abscess lesions.	1
We have recently employed mass spectrometry in @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiling of Gram-positive bacteria @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ and reported the discovery of novel @sm$ lipids @/sm$ such as N-succinyl-lysyl-PG from Staphylococcus haemolyticus. By searching for precursors of m/z 140 deprotonated phosphoethanolamine head group fragment in @sm$ lipids @/sm$ extracted from Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter radioresistens, we observed a @sm$ lipid @/sm$ species similar in size to lysocardiolipin (LCL), and tentatively assigned its chemical structure as 1-phosphatidyl-2-acyl-glycero-3-phophoethanolamine (PAGPE). Importantly, PAGPE was only observed in the stationary phase. Since the lipidome of this bacterium was also observed to transition from a PE and PG-dominated state in the exponential growth phase to a CL and LCL-dominated state in the stationary phase, we postulate that PAGPE with a compatible shape to LCL and CL may serve as a better charge modulator than the much smaller PE in the bacterial membrane during stationary phase. We also observed small amounts of two additional tri-acylated phospholipids: acyl-phosphatidylglycerol (APG) and N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). Importantly, production of NAPE was also triggered by the onset of stationary phase. The @sm$ lipid @/sm$ extracts also contained large amounts of triglycerides (TG) which likely serves as an fatty acid reserve.	1
We have shown previously that bacteria isolated from this environment possess IncP-9 family plasmids and can degrade phenol, @sm$ benzoate @/sm$, m-toluate, salicylate, naphthalene and toluene. Vedler et al. also showed that 3 out of 38 strains degrading phenol via the catechol meta pathway have two to three phylogenetically different C23O genes. One of these strains, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes C70, is able to grow on naphthalene in addition to phenol, but not on @sm$ benzoate @/sm$ or toluate, and was selected for future investigation in this study. Whole genome sequencing revealed the occurrence of three genetically different sequences of the 16S rRNA gene, one most similar to P. pseudoalcaligenes and the other two to @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$.	2
We have studied proton movements associated with substrate transport via the galactose transport system in @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$. The addition of galactose to lightly buffered suspensions of anaerobic, non-metabolizing cells of @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$, specifically induced for the galactose transport system, causes an increase in extracellularpH as galactose and protons enter the cell together. Other substrates for this transport system, D-fucose, 2-deoxygalactose, glucose and @sm$ 2-deoxyglucose @/sm$ similarly cause an influx of protons when transported.	2
We hypothesized that the alginate-degrading bacteria may mediate the anti-colitis effect of alginate since these bacteria can utilize this @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ to promote their growth. To test this hypothesis, we isolated 296 strains of alginate-degrading bacteria from the human gut and found that @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ AY11-1 has the best capability for the degradation of alginate. Interestingly, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ AY11-1 was also observed to have a potent anti-colitis effect in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-fed mice. Our present study illustrates for the first time an anti-colitis effect of the alginate-degrading bacterium B. xylanisolvens AY11-1 and paves the way for the development of @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ AY11-1 as a next-generation probiotic bacterium.	2
We identified 40 taxa significantly associated with inflammation, including those reported previously (Prevotella, Sneathia, Aerococcus, Fusobacterium, and Gemella) as well as several novel taxa (including increased frequencies of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 1 [BVAB1], BVAB2, BVAB3, Prevotella amnii, Prevotella pallens, @gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$, Megasphaera, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Atopobium vaginae and decreased frequencies of Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners). Women with inflammation-associated microbiomes had significantly higher body mass indices and lower levels of endogenous estradiol and @sm$ luteinizing hormone @/sm$.	0
We know that @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ and K. pneumoniae are present in the oral cavity and intestinal tract of many humans, suggesting most could be producing endogenous @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ after ingesting sugar. Another study reported that up to 3.5 mg/dL @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ was detected in 1,557 healthy @sm$ alcohol @/sm$-free individuals, due to fungal parasitization of the gastrointestinal tract, presumably due to fermentation. 7  In another study where an alcohol-degrading enzyme inhibitor was orally administered, blood @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ levels were increased when apple juice was ingested without @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ in healthy subjects. 8  These reports support the notion that endogenous @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ production occurs in healthy humans.	1
We next tested the ability of 32 strains of bacteria to produce @sm$ 2HB @/sm$ in vitro by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass (LC-MS/MS). After 24 h of growth (A. muciniphila were cultured for 72 h). @sm$ 2HB @/sm$ content in supernatant significantly increased in 21 bacterial strains, reduced in 4 bacterial strains, and 7 bacterial strains had no significant changes (Figure 2A and Table S3). Although 21 strains of bacteria have the ability to synthesize @sm$ 2HB @/sm$, their yields vary greatly. Moreover, different bacteria strains have different substrate preferences. For example, @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ performs the highest synthetic ability and preferentially uses threonine as the substrate for @sm$ 2HB @/sm$ production.	1
We observed reduced @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ among MS patients (Fig. 2). These species convert @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ to methane, promoting carbohydrate fermentation and SCFA production. Nevertheless, the role of @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ remains to be elucidated, as others observed increased prevalence in MS. The discrepancy may be partially attributed to technical differences. @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ is also associated with constipation and thus its detection may depend on the condition of the stool sample.	1
We observed that Saccharomycetales spp had a positive association with Clostridium sensu stricto 1, @gm$ Faecalitalea @/gm$ and Megamonas (p<0.05, figure 5C). All these bacterial taxa are SCFA producers. Consistent with this, Saccharomycetales spp was positively associated with acetic acid and butyric acid (p<0.008, online supplemental table S12). Nevertheless, more mechanistic work is needed to understand the relationship among gut Saccharomycetales spp, bacteria, SCFAs and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ homeostasis.	0
We previously associated this family with BMI and @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ in 16S rRNA data. In the current study we observed higher BMI was associated with lower level of two species from the family Rikenellaceae, Alistipes finegoldii, and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$, while blood lipids were associated with other two species, Alistipes shahii and Alistipes putredinis (table S11). Strikingly, these species were also associated to certain dietary factors and drugs. For instance, a high level of Alistipes shahii, which was associated to low TG levels, was linked to higher fruit intake (q= 0.00027). Individuals with a higher abundance level of Alistipes shahii had a higher number of different species in the gut (species richness) (Spearman r=0.2, adjusted p=3.96x10-11), suggesting a beneficial effect on the microbial ecosystem (table S18). Correlations with the number of different species were also found for other bacteria including Roseburia hominis, Coprococcus catus, and Barnesiella intestinihominis and unclassified species from genus Anaerotruncus that also showed correlation both with fruit, vegetable, and nut consumption and with intrinsic phenotypes like HDL, @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ and quality of life.	0

We report the development of a series of substrates and inhibitors, which we use to kinetically and structurally characterise this novel endo-alpha-1,2-mannanase activity of bacterial GH99 enzymes from @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ and xylanisolvens. These data reveal an approximate 5 kJ mol(-1) preference for mannose-configured substrates in the -2 subsite (relative to @sm$ glucose @/sm$), which inspired the development of a new inhibitor, alpha-mannopyranosyl-1,3-isofagomine (ManIFG), the most potent (bacterial) GH99 inhibitor reported to date. X-ray structures of ManIFG or a substrate in complex with wild-type or inactive mutants, respectively, of B. xylanisolvens GH99 reveal the structural basis for binding to D-mannose- rather than @sm$ D-glucose @/sm$-configured substrates.	2
We reported our first attempt to localize the conjugation sites in the hapten-BSA glycoconjugate made from the monosaccharide antigen of the O-PS of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ serotype Ogawa. The glycoconjugate was first digested with trypsin and the suspected glycated digests were then analyzed by MALDI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). However, the presence of only three glycation sites were identified, despite the average molecular mass of the conjugate evidenced that it contained ~5 moles of the ligand per mole of the carrier, as determined by MALDI-MS. This discrepancy was attributed to the poor ionization of the glycated @sm$ peptides @/sm$.	0
We selected the bai operon for 7alpha-dehydroxylating of CA (cholate)/CDCA (chenodeoxycholate) to DCA (deoxycholate)/LCA (@sm$ lithocholate @/sm$) for follow-up studies. Three reasons motivated us to choose this pathway (Fig. 4, and Data S1): 1) Interestingly, we found one commensal @gm$ Faecalicatena contorta @/gm$ S122 (S122) that efficiently converts CA(1)/CDCA to DCA(3)/LCA (Figs.	1
We studied the morphology, oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, and pH requirements, fermentation patterns, end products of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ fermentation, biochemical reactions, protein electrophoretic patterns, isozyme patterns, DNA homology relationships, and guanine-plus-cytosine contents of these organisms, and we propose that these two groups of strains should be considered new species, Bifidobacterium ruminantium (type strain, strain ATCC 49390) and @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ (type strain, strain ATCC 49391).	2
We then focused on the @sm$ fatty-acid @/sm$-related pathways and found that the superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis initiation (P = 8.34e-8), @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ elongation (P = 0.037), type II fatty acid synthase (P = 0.027), superpathway of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis (P = 0.027), and superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis (P = 0.030) were all highly enriched in the Angus cattle (Figure 2B). These results were consistent with the muscular phenotypes, indicating that the Angus cattle hold more types of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ than the Simmental cattle (Supplementary Table 1). We further studied the association between the gut microbiota and the superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis initiation (Supplementary Figure 3). In total, 13 significantly related species including B. uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus), Blautia obeum (B. obeum), Ruminococcus torques, Clostridium bornimense, Coprococcus catus (C. catus), Coprococcus comes, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Dorea longicatena, Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum, Sphingomonas sp.	1
We then turned to the rest of the community to determine whether these changes in @sm$ glycan @/sm$ metabolism had effects on the metabolic responses of other organisms. The B. infantis Bg2D9 transcriptome was distinct from B. infantis Bg463 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with the UHPLC-QqQ-MS-based analysis of caecal @sm$ glycans @/sm$, arabinose utilization was among the most upregulated pathways in B. catenulatum, M. multacida and @gm$ B. obeum @/gm$:three of the four organisms predicted to be capable of utilizing arabinose (Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 8c,d). These three organisms were also significantly more abundant with B. infantis Bg2D9 colonization (Extended Data Fig. 2b). B. catenulatum upregulated arabinose utilization genes directly in response to P. copri colonization (arm 2 versus arm 3; Extended Data Fig. 3d). By contrast, M. multacida and @gm$ B. obeum @/gm$ showed upregulation of arabinose utilization in response to B. infantis Bg2D9 colonization (arm 1 versus arm 2; Extended Data Fig. 3d). M. multacida and @gm$ B. obeum @/gm$ also showed significant upregulation of almost all their genes involved in biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids as well as glutamate and glutamine with B.	2
We therefore examined whether TyrB, Hpd or ThiH homologous proteins were found in all four strains (@gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ YIT 10080T, Cl. difficile YIT 10084T, O. uli YIT 12014T and R. lituseburensis YIT 10059T) with high p-cresol-producing ability. We used information already reported on their draft genome sequences. No proteins with more than 30% amino acid sequence identity to TyrB of E. coli strain K-12 were found. In Cl. difficile DSM 1296T, three enzymes:HpdA, an activating enzyme; HpdC, a large subunit; and HpdC, a small subunit:are responsible for Hpd activity and are encoded in the hpdBCA operon (Andrei et al.). Homologs of HpdBCA were identified in all four strains, with more than 30% identity of amino acid sequences (Table 3). In all four strains, the three homologs were encoded in a line in the order of hpdB, hpdC and hpdA (Fig. S1B, Supporting Information). ThiH from E. coli strain K-12 metabolizes tyrosine to dehydroglycine as the first step of the @sm$ thiamine @/sm$ synthesis pathway, and p-cresol is formed as a by-product of this step (Kriek et al.). We then found ThiH homologs encoded by the genome of Cl. difficile YIT 10084T (36% amino acid sequence identity) and R. lituseburensis YIT 10059T (35%) (Table 3). Analysis of homologs of other enzymes involved revealed that all four strains harbored FldH or PorA or both (data not shown). FldBC homologs were identified in @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ YIT 10080T and O.	1
We thus applied our RFC modeling pipeline to target outcomes of patients requiring <4 L (moderate disease) or >4 L of @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ (severe disease). A combination of clinical and stool microbiome variables, specifically when classifying at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level, was able to predict COVID-19 severity better than clinical variables alone (F1-score of 83.9 versus 80.1; Fig. 2A). Feature ranking on model results revealed members of the classes Bacteroidia (Bacteroides uniformis and B. fragilis), Clostridia (Oscillibacter ruminatium, Aminipila butyrica, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Faecalicatena contorta @/gm$, and Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum), and Bacilli (Haloimpatiens massiliensis and Enterococcus faecalis) along with hypercholesteremia are among the top 10 variables that predicted COVID-19 severity (Fig.	0
We used a different set of functions from the splinectomeR package to test whether the abundance of a taxonomic unit (genus and species) was significantly different across the time series between the control microbiome not exposed to @sm$ 4-NQO @/sm$ and the two @sm$ 4-NQO @/sm$-exposed microbiomes. Table S1 shows the significance of the differences between the trajectories of different genera and species across the time series. Despite the differences described above, specific patterns of behavior with significant differences were conserved in both comparisons: group 1 versus group 3 and group 1 versus group 4. For instance, the genus Parabacteroides showed a tendency to decrease in relative abundance in the control group, while Lachnoclostridium showed a tendency to decrease in relative abundance in the @sm$ 4-NQO @/sm$-exposed tumorigenic microbiomes, and Corynebacterium, Blautia, and Christensenella increased in relative abundance with time (Fig. S5). The time series analysis by species showed an increase in relative abundance for @gm$ D. formicigenerans @/gm$, [Clostridium] scindens, Faecalicatena orotica, and B. pseudolongum in group 3, while only A. muris showed a significant increase in relative abundance in group 4 (Fig. S6). Interestingly, the results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis for the different time points showed @gm$ D. formicigenerans @/gm$ to be a biomarker of group 3 (Fig.	0
We verified that the @gm$ Blautia @/gm$-acetate axis is compromised in patients with major depressive disorder. Patients with breast cancer accompanied by depression are characterized by lower levels of serum @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells compared to those without depression. One limitation of our study is the unavailability of fecal samples from breast cancer patients with and without depression, which hindered a direct assessment of how the @gm$ Blautia @/gm$-@sm$ acetate @/sm$ axis is involved in these patients. However, results collected from animal studies, the in vitro co-culture system, and correlation analysis in human patients suggest that the compromised @gm$ Blautia @/gm$-@sm$ acetate @/sm$ axis likely contributes to depression-promoted breast cancer progression in humans and indicate that targeting the @gm$ Blautia @/gm$-@sm$ acetate @/sm$ axis could be a promising therapeutic approach for breast cancer patients with co-existent depression.	1
Weak growth of @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ on @sm$ l-fucose @/sm$ was observed after the addition of acetate but without detected metabolite production.	2
Weltevreden in the minimal media M9 with glucose, @sm$ mannitol @/sm$, galactose, glycerol, and in combination glycerol + @sm$ mannitol @/sm$ was compared with growth of S. Typhimurium TL2, S. Agona, and S. Seftenberg. The bioscreen showed that all tested strains were able to grow with the different tested carbon sources from 0.001 to 0.2% of carbohydrate with no difference between the growth rates (unpublished data). These preliminary results show no growth differences between S. Weltevreden and other @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ serotypes as opposed to the expectations from the genomic data and therefore points to the need for further growth experiments of other more specific carbon sources for PTS-specific system found in S.	0

When compared with Gram-positive microbes Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus acidophilus in a previous study, @gm$ B. theta @/gm$ was much more sensitive to bile acids TCDCA, TDCA, and @sm$ DCA @/sm$ while being similarly resistant to TCA and GCA. In addition, lactobacilli did not show the same pattern of membrane damage, where deconjugated bile acids impacted membrane integrity more than conjugated bile acids. @gm$ B. theta @/gm$ WT had significantly less membrane damage than @gm$ B. theta @/gm$ triple KO in the presence of CDCA.	3
When glycine and @sm$ taurine @/sm$ are separated from the BS, they can be used as sources of C and N. The deconjugation is catalyzed by the BSH and, despite the fact that no BSH were identified in the genes, it is likely that some S. epidermidis genomes encode enzymes able to perform deconjugation. These results, in combination with the growth curves observed in anaerobic conditions, suggest that some skin isolates are able to behave similarly to gut isolates but need some time to adapt to the absence of oxygen. Conversely, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 and RP62A - a non-infection related and a sepsis-related strain, respectively - showed less ability to grow in anaerobic conditions and clearly attenuated growth in bile. Once the skin isolates S. epidermidis DSM 20042 and DSM 28764 start growing, bile does not have a clear impact on exponential growth. Interestingly, the growth displayed by the skin isolates in the presence of BA suggest that they may use these BA as a source of nutrients in anaerobic conditions, as there seems to be a positive effect on final OD. The decrease of glycine-conjugated BAs might suggest that the glycine could have been used. In contrast, @sm$ taurine @/sm$-conjugated BAs were not metabolized by any isolate, which is consistent with the fact that only one intestinal species, @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, is able to use @sm$ taurine @/sm$.	2
Where a strain had been isolated from an infant or breast milk sample but not a corresponding maternal stool sample, the genomic data from the infant strains and the knowledge that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species can utilise a wide array of carbohydrates was exploited to attempt isolation of the same strain from maternal stool, similar to a method described previously. Strains were isolated as previously described but the carbohydrates used were @sm$ ribose @/sm$ (for B.	2
Whereas mammalian carbohydrates are generated from as few as ten different monosaccharides, the diversity of @sm$ glycans @/sm$ within bacteria is far greater. Many monosaccharides of the prokaryotic kingdom differ structurally from their mammalian counterparts with regard to stereocentres, number of carbons, number of amino groups and/or in their decoration with unique chemical functionalities. One of the unusual sugars belonging to the family of nonulosonic acids is pseudaminic acid (Pse). The Pse unit is found in many @sm$ glycans @/sm$ of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. In several cases Pse is part of an oligosaccharide; however, it can be attached directly to a target protein (Figure 1). Pse residues are found in the flagellar protein flagellin, in lipopolysaccharides and/or in capsules of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio vulnificus, @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$, Bacillus thuringiensis and Campylobacter jejuni.	1
While 39 were involved uniquely in samples from the Adadle woreda, including Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus ruminis, 25 species, notably Blautia obeum and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$, were not involved in any of the metabolic pathways found in the samples from the Adadle woreda (Supplementary Fig. S11). Additionally, we noted a high diversity of Streptococcus species contributing to metabolic pathways in samples from the Adadle woreda. These species were notably involved in carbohydrate degradation pathways, including starch (PWY-6731), lactose (LACTOSECAT-PWY) and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ (PWY-6317), (Fig.	2
While bacteria that considered to be beneficial (e.g, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, and Butyrivibrio) are enriched in healthy controls, harmful bacteria such as @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Klebsiella, Porphyromonas, and Actinomyces are elevated in the hypertensive group. The gut microbiota can influence blood pressure by regulating hormones such as serotonin, @sm$ dopamine @/sm$, and norepinephrine and kidney function to excrete sodium load. Chronic pro-inflammation in hypertension can be also the result of gut microbial action. @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ is enhanced in individuals with hypertension and contributes to inflammation by releasing superoxide reductase and phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate reductase. Immune responses triggered by endotoxin from @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Klebsiella are also related to the chronic low-grade inflammation in hypertension.	3
While hydrogenotrophic archaea use @sm$ H2 @/sm$ + CO2 or formate as substrates, methylotrophic organisms form methane from methylated compounds, and aceticlastic archaea use acetate as substrate. M. luminyensis is distinct from these common groups because it uses @sm$ H2 @/sm$ as electron donor but is not able to reduce CO2 to CH4. In the first description of the strain, it was stated that methanogenesis is possible by methanol reduction with @sm$ H2 @/sm$ as the electron donor. In this respect, M. luminyensis resembled @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$, another methanogenic archaeon that was isolated from human feces and can use methanol in the presence of @sm$ H2 @/sm$. Genome analysis revealed that besides the genes for methanol utilization, members of the genus Methanomassiliicoccus contain complete sets of genes for the degradation of methylamines to CH4 and NH3. Lang et al. showed that methane accumulated in the culture headspace of M. luminyensis containing methanol, monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA), or trimethylamine (TMA) in the presence of @sm$ H2 @/sm$. In addition, it was found that M. luminyensis grows on TMA in the presence of @sm$ H2 @/sm$ but not on TMA in the absence of @sm$ H2 @/sm$.	1
While investigating these plausible relationships, we indeed found a significant positive correlation between three species (Acetatifactor sp002490995, Tranquillimonas alkanivorans, and CAG-776 sp000438195) and fasting @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels (Fig. 4a, black dots, both sexes combined). One of these species, Acetatifactor sp002490995, also showed a trend of positive correlation with colonic cell proliferation (measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry) and another, CAG-776 sp000438195, with insulin levels (Fig. 4b, d, black dots, sexes combined). These species were all of higher abundance in males (under HFD), and the two latter were further reduced by E2 in males (CAG-776 sp000438195 reduced by both E2 and DPN treatment, Supplementary Fig. 3f, Acetatifactor sp002490995 reduced by E2 in fecal samples, Supplementary Fig. 6d). Also, @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ showed a positive correlation to plasma @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels in males (Fig.	0
While methanogenesis in @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ can proceed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen alone, there is evidence that @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ can utilise the bacterial fermentation products alcohol and @sm$ methanol @/sm$ for methanogenesis using an inducible NADP-dependent oxidoreductase with a coenzyme F420 prosthetic group (F420-dependent NADP oxidoreductase, fno).46 Fno is mentioned here in anticipation of a review of molecular docking experiments with fno that suggest an additional or alternative mechanism of action for statins.	2
While microbiome alpha and beta diversity was not different between dystonia patients and controls, dystonia patients had higher abundances of Ruminococcus torques and @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, and a lower abundance of Butyrivibrio crossotus compared to controls. For those with dystonia, non-motor symptoms and the levels of neurotransmitters in plasma explained the variance in the gut microbiome composition. Several neuro-active metabolic pathways, especially @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ degradation, were less abundant in the dystonia patients compared to controls.	2
While the functionality of the dairy-associated species @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$, L. laudensis and L. hircilactis in dairy fermentations is not well defined, there is evidence to suggest that members of these species have acquired the ability to grow in milk. For example, L. raffinolactis strain 4877 is described to possess the complete set of genes required for lactose fermentation as well as those involved in oligopeptide transport (Meslier et al., ). This strain was isolated from a natural dairy starter culture in France and while it is described as a non-starter component of the culture, it was present in sufficient abundance to be distinguished from the dominant starter bacterial species within the culture. L. raffinolactis strain 37 was isolated from raw cow's milk and its growth and acid production were stimulated by the metabolites (in the cell-free supernatant) of a L. lactis strain (Kimoto-Nira et al., ). @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ strains are incapable of growth at 40 C and are sensitive to the presence of 4% @sm$ sodium chloride @/sm$ in the growth medium. Strains of this species do not perform arginine deamination and require supplementation with yeast extract to clot milk in pure culture (Kimoto-Nira et al., ). Interestingly, these characteristics are reminiscent of L. cremoris strains with the exception of growth in milk without supplementation. Therefore, while strains of @gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ are unlikely to be employed as starter cultures in the dairy industry, they may be useful adjunct cultures to support or enhance the acidification and/or flavour profiles of mesophilic starter culture systems.	3
While the ileal microbiota is often dominated by Firmicutes members, mainly from the genera Streptococcus, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Clostridium, the small intestine from some individuals is distinct with high relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and specific genera such as Fusobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Blautia, and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$. Furthermore, there seems to be consistency in metabolic functionality. Each elucidated ileal community comprises primary fermenters (e.g., Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus) which metabolize simple carbohydrates into, e.g., lactate that supports growth of secondary fermenters (e.g., Veillonella). The latter consume lactate to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; mainly @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and propionate in the case of Veillonella) in a process termed cross-feeding.	1
While the main sources of @sm$ nickel @/sm$ (Ni) are motor vehicles and coal and oil burning, cobalt (@gm$ Co) comes @/gm$ mainly from coal burning.	0
While the presence of Dysgonomonas and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ spp. were higher in the Danville strain, they are present to a reduced extent in the guts of J-wax roaches as well. It is possible that there are further differences between the two strains at the species level. Dysgonomonas has been previously isolated from the guts of the subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus and researchers suggest this genus requires @sm$ heme @/sm$ to grow. Dysgonomonas has not been well-studied, especially outside of human guts, so it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions on insecticide resistance based on its presence in a resistant cockroach strain. @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ is a nascent sub-branch genus of the Bacteroidetes phylum which are commonly associated with chronic intestinal inflammation in humans and was first discovered in samples of children with appendicitis. @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ has one of the highest numbers of putrefaction pathways amongst human gut commensal bacteria. Putrefaction is the fermentation of undigested proteins in the GI tract which typically leads to bacterial production of harmful (or occasionally helpful) metabolites. Similar to Dysgonomonas, the authors cannot presently draw conclusions about the contributions of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ spp.	2
While there are concerns about the consequences of widespread use of @sm$ quinolones @/sm$, there are few reports of @sm$ quinolone @/sm$-resistant strains of Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi from the Indian subcontinent. We present a case report of a newborn with meningitis due to a @sm$ quinolone @/sm$-resistant strain of @gm$ S. paratyphi B @/gm$ presenting to the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH).	4
With a human faecal inoculum reported no difference in @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium populations compared to the control; only an increase in Enterobacter after 24 h and 48 h of fermentation (Table 6). In contrast, a recent in vitro faecal fermentation study indicated that Ulvan stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus populations and promoted the production of lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$.	1
With respect to common bacterial CAP pathogens, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ resistance has been well-described for S. pneumoniae. The most reported mechanism of resistance is expression of the RPP Tet(M). Notably, the Tn916 family transposons in pneumococci harbor the erm(B)-carrying mobile genetic elements, which confers resistance to the macrolides, and many Tn916 derivatives also carry tet(M). Therefore, cross-resistance between macrolides and doxycycline/minocycline may be observed. With respect to other CABP pathogens, Mycoplasma spp. and @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ spp.	4
With respect to the absence of LT4 treatment, twelve kinds of bacteria (class Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacterales, and family Enterobacteriaceae in T2, phylum Actinobacteriota, classes Coriobacteriia and Actinobacteria, orders Coriobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales, family Bifidobacteriaceae, genus Bifidobacterium, and species @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium longum in T3) were considered as special bacteria for TPOAb- women with SCH, and these were found to be involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism (@sm$ galactose @/sm$ metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan_biosynthesis). In the presence of LT4 treatment, five kinds of special bacteria were identified for TPOAb- women with SCH (phylum Bacteroidota, class Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, and genus Prevotella in T2 and genus Agathobacter in T3), and these were found to be involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism (pentose and glucuronate interconversions; tryptophan metabolism). Earlier studies showed that subjects with GDM were characterized by a decrease in the abundance of members of family Enterobacteriaceae . SCFAs, which are produced by species @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, may suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines.	1
With the incorporation of these growth rates from the literature and our metabolite utilization experiment, we have consolidated the available growth rate data and expanded the knowledge of which substrates @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ may use. Subsequently, we analyzed @sm$ carbon @/sm$ utilization pathways and determined condition-dependent fermentation profiles.	2
Within the analysis for the detection of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ as an alternative to the traditional microbiological analysis, molecular techniques have been developed based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with its different variants, which show greater specificity, sensitivity, reliability, and speed in the detection of the pathogen in fish and tilapia samples, and that use as targets regions of the 23S rRNA gene, 16S rRNA, gyrB, fur (ferric uptake regulator), and hugA gene, the latter encoding an outer membrane receptor required for the use of 435-bp @sm$ heme iron @/sm$.	2
Yogurt is a result of the fermentation process of living microorganisms, specifically lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which ferment lactose into @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, causing the coagulation of milk. LAB present in milk during fermentation play a very important role in enriching it with nutritional values. Microorganisms enable the enrichment of milk with @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, peptides, and amino acids with antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, as well as break down the milk fat into free fatty acids and produce compounds in the yogurt matrix that contribute to the aroma and taste of yogurt. The combination of @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.	1
Young adults residing in Southern California, who are more exposed to atmospheric @sm$ ozone @/sm$, show lower gut microbial diversity with increased abundances of Bacteroides caecimuris. An interesting study profiled the microbiome from remains of ancient human feces and found a similarity to pre-industrial humans. Ancient microbiome shows higher abundances of Enterococcus, @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$, and Ruminococcus champenellensis.	0
abortus S19 increased the attenuation of the S19 strain without altering its protective efficacy against @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ 2,308. In addition, the deletion of the vjbR gene, which is responsible for intracellular Brucella persistence, resulted in a recombinant mutant with high levels of protection and reduced inflammation. @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ targeted mutants with deletions in the membrane fusogenic protein (Mfp) or OMP19 genes decrease Brucella persistence in animal studies. However, challenge tests have revealed that traditional attenuated vaccines such as S19 and RB51 strains provide similar levels of protection. The deletion of the wbkC gene of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ (DeltawbkC), which translated to formyltransferase enzyme, showed a protection level similar to @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ rough strain RB51 avoiding the rifampicin resistance which is the main disadvantage of RB51. However, @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ DeltawbkC did not produce the same level of protectin when compared to B. abortus S19 and avoided interfering with the serological diagnosis which is also the main disadvantage of the S19 vaccine strain. The Glycosyltransferase Wad C gene is involved in the production of the core oligosaccharide region of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ and is essential for efficient innate immune recognition.	1
abortus antibody detection in adult sheep was performed using the @sm$ Rose Bengal @/sm$-stained rapid plate seroagglutination with buffered acidified antigen (BAA) test. The agar gel immunodiffusion test using a commercial antigen was performed for @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tecpar, Curitiba, Brazil).	3
abortus biovar 2, or @gm$ B. suis biovar @/gm$ 5. Three ribosomal associated loci, 23S rrn, rplV, and rplD, were analyzed from eryR mutants of @gm$ B. suis biovar @/gm$ 1, B. canis, B. neotomae, and the three marine Brucella (Table 4). The spontaneous eryR rate among the classical Brucella spp. varied by 100-fold. Rates of mutation to eryR and highest concentration of @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ allowing growth for each parental strains of the classical Brucella spp. were: @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ 3.7 x 10-7 (5 mug/ml @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$); B. canis 1.5 x 10-8 (20 mug/ml @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$); and B. neotomae 6.6 x 10-8 (5 mug/ml @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$). All the marine eryR isolates were selected from plates containing 20 mug/ml @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, and mutational rates were 1.9 x 10-6, 5.1 x 10-7, and 2.7 x 10-6 for porpoise, seal, and dolphin, respectively.	4
abortus wadC mutant exhibited a partially defective core oligosaccharide but an intact @sm$ lipid A @/sm$ and O-side chain. bmGM-DCs were stimulated with LPS purified from the wadC mutant and wild-type strain. The mutant LPS induced higher production of IL-12, TNFalpha, and CD86 and MHC-II overexpression, but cells stimulated with the wild-type LPS did not (Conde-Alvarez et al.). Similar experiments were performed by Zhao et al. using human monocyte-derived GM-DCs stimulated with @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$-wadC mutant LPS and wild type LPS, the production of IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNFalpha was observed only in cells stimulated with mutant LPS (Zhao et al.).	3
abscessus and @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ after therapy as well as in vitro selection (Wallace et al.,; Prammananan et al.,). Mycobacterium abscessus represents one of the most common antibiotic-resistant RGM species, which is usually resistant to major anti-TB drugs, as well as most antimycobacterial drugs, including tetracycline, fluoroquinolones and @sm$ sulphonamides @/sm$ (Nessar et al.,).	4
abscessus, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, M. Bolleti, and M. massiliense, and these results are summarized in Table 2. Minhas and colleagues published a case report assessing utilization of omadacycline in a resistant pulmonary M. abscessus infection of a 67-year-old Chinese female with documented drug allergies to several antimicrobials, including imipenem, @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$, and others.	3
acetethylicum strain GluBS11T are located in a putative operon that also contains genes associated with fucose utilization in @gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 700394 @/gm$ T. Fucose, a deoxyhexose derived from plant biomass degradation, can be fermented to propionate, propanol, mixed acids, and ethanol by @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 700394 @/gm$ T , and the responsible genes are located in two different operons in this organism. Initially, fucose is converted to fuculose-phosphate by fucose mutarotase, fucose isomerase and fucose kinase (Cphy_3153 - Cphy_3155). Likewise, the orthologs in A. acetethylicum strain GluBS11T are located in a similar operon (L-fucose isomerase Ga0116910_100812, rhamnulokinase/L-fuculokinase Ga0116910_100813 and L-fucose mutarotase Ga0116910_100815). Fuculose-phosphate is then further degraded to lactaldehyde and @sm$ dihydroxyacetone-phosphate @/sm$ by fuculose-phosphate aldolase (Ga0116910_102223 in A. acetethylicum strain GluBS11T, Cphy_1177 in @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$). @sm$ Dihydroxyacetone phosphate @/sm$ can then be processed through glycolysis, while lactaldehyde is reduced to 1,2-propanediol with NADH. 1,2-propanediol is then disproportionated in microcompartments to propionate and propanol by 1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase (Cphy_1185, Ga0116910_1005154), 1,2-propanediol dehydratase (Cphy_1174, Ga0116910_100557 - Ga0116910_100559 in a different area of the genome), propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (Cphy_1178, Ga0116910_1005146), phosphate propanoyl transferase (Cphy_1183, Ga0116910_1005152), acetate/propionate kinase (Cphy_1327, Ga0116910_104214, Ga0116910_1001586, or Ga0116910_103636) and propanol dehydrogenase (Cphy_1179, Ga0116910_1005147). Rhamnose can be degraded in a similar way by @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 700394 @/gm$ T , and the respective genes leading to lactaldehyde and @sm$ dihydroxyacetone-phosphate @/sm$ were also identified in the genome of A.	2
acidilactici and @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ on growth pHs and temperatures, as well as the ability to ferment various sugars has been given by Mundt et al., Garvie and Ray et al.. Most strains are able to ferment glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, cellobiose, arabinose, ribose, salicin, amygdalin, esculin, but not ferment sorbose, @sm$ melibiose @/sm$, inulin, starch, dextrin and sugar alcohols.	2
acidophilus NCFM encodes 20 PEP-PTS; the transporters have predicted specificity for trehalose, fructose, sucrose, glucose, mannose, melibiose, gentiobiose, cellobiose, @sm$ salicin @/sm$, arbutin and N-acetylglucosamine PTS. The genome of Lb. gasseri @gm$ ATCC 33323 @/gm$, another acidophilus complex bacterium, encodes 21 PEP-PTS transporters including those for predicted transport of fructose, mannose, glucose, cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, beta-glucosides and N-acetylglucosamine.	2
acidophilus, @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$, L. reuteri, L. lactis, L. plantarum and S. thermophilus, E. faecalis) were individually incubated with MOO for 12 h in vitro. The results show that these strains can produce 5-HTP and @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$. With MOO treatment, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ significantly increased the 5-HTP (P < 0.05, Fig. 6B) and decreased the @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ (P < 0.05, Fig. 6C), suggesting that it is an important strain in the increase of 5-HTP levels and decrease of @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ levels by MOO. Interestingly, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$, a kind of probiotic, could also produce butyric acid and acetic acid. According to reports, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ could attenuates chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. The above results indicate that the anti-depressant effect of MOO seen in CUMS rats may be due to a change in the composition of the gut microbiota, specifically a decrease in the abundance of bacteria associated with depression, as their abundance was altered upon MOO treatment. Moreover, at least @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ might be the important bacteria involved in the increase of 5-HTP levels and decrease of @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ levels in the gut microbiota, after oral administration of MOO.	1
actinomycetemcomitans detoxifies @sm$ peroxide @/sm$, one of the major by-products of S. gordonii metabolism. This metabolic synergy results in a mutualistic relationship between both species during an abscess co-infection in which both bacteria reach higher burdens when they are together than when they are apart. In these abscesses, A. actinomycetemcomitans strongly colocalizes around S. gordonii, promoting cross-feeding while also maintaining a >4 microm gap from S. gordonii to avoid growth inhibition by @sm$ peroxide @/sm$. A. actinomycetemcomitans acquires this spacing by sensing @sm$ peroxide @/sm$, immediately after which it activates an enzyme, known as dispersin B, which dissolves its biofilm matrix. Inactivation of this enzyme disrupts the spacing, placing A. actinomycetemcomitans directly next to S. gordonii, disturbing co-infection synergy. Similar fine-scale spatial patterns are also seen for other synergistic oral pathogens, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$.	3
actinomycetemcomitans sonicated extract, @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ sonicated extract, @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$, or TNF-alpha for 4 hrs. Our results showed that the expression of Wnt5a mRNA in HGF-1 cells was constant in response to different treatments (Fig. 2A). However, in THP-1 cells, Wnt5a mRNA was strongly induced by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ but was only slightly increased by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ sonicated extracts or a high concentration of TNF-alpha. Live @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ also significantly increased the expression of Wnt5a mRNA in THP-1 (Fig. 2E). When THP-1 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ or E. coli @sm$ LPS @/sm$ (Fig. 2C), the maximum Wnt5a mRNA expression occurred after stimulation with 1 microg/ml of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$. @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ could induce more potent Wnt5a mRNA expression than E. coli @sm$ LPS @/sm$. When THP-1 cells were stimulated with 1 microg/ml of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ for 0.5, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hrs, the maximum expression of Wnt5a mRNA occurred at 4 hrs after stimulation (Fig. 2B). Flow cytometry demonstrated that TLR2 and TLR4 were equally expressed on the surface of THP-1 cells stimulated by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ and E. coli @sm$ LPS @/sm$, suggesting that the expression of these receptors were not changed by the stimulation (Fig. 2D). @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$-induced Wnt5a mRNA was significantly reduced by either TLR2 siRNA or TLR4 siRNA (Fig. 2H), suggesting that @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ used in this study utilized both TLR2 and TLR4.	1
adolescentis and @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ usually appear in the intestinal tract of adults. According to the latest taxonomy, @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ contains two subspecies, @gm$ B. catenulatum subsp @/gm$. kashiwanohense and @gm$ B. catenulatum subsp @/gm$. catenulatum. These two subspecies have different preferences in infant and adult intestine. @gm$ B. catenulatum subsp @/gm$. catenulatum is usually the dominant Bifidobacterium species in the adult gut. Although @gm$ B. catenulatum subsp @/gm$. catenulatum is also present in infants, it is not the dominant Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut microbiota, and it is shown to be shared between in single mother-infant pairs. @gm$ B. catenulatum subsp @/gm$. kashiwanohense is a greatly rare species, which lives mainly in the gut of infants. Current research suggests that @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$'s adaptation to different hosts is partially due to the functional preference of different subspecies, such as @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism.	2
adolescentis and the @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ group are also abundant in adult intestinal microbiota. This transition of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microbiota with age is primarily due to changes in diet and possibly host @sm$ glycans @/sm$ (described below). Considering the age-related compositional changes and nutritional adaptation, Bifidobacterium species can be classified into at least four groups: the HMO-dedicated group (B. infantis), the dietary fiber-adapted group (B. adolescentis, @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ group, and other adult-type species except B. longum), the both HMO and dietary fiber-adapted group (B. breve and B. longum), and the both HMO and mucin-adapted group (B. bifidum). Thus, as the sole known mucin-degrader within the genus Bifidobacterium, B. bifidum is uniquely positioned in the context of carbohydrate utilization strategies. This may be the reason it is detected in a wide range of age groups, except for centenarians. It is known that intestinal mucin production becomes low in elderly adults. Therefore, the nutritional switch, as well as host @sm$ glycan @/sm$ availability, may have an impact on bifidobacterial prevalence and abundance.	2
adolescentis was heat-inactivated in 95 C @sm$ water @/sm$ bath for 15 min before experiment treatment. Each mouse was administrated intragastrically with 200 mul sterile PBS or heat-inactivated B. adolescentis every other day. @gm$ Lactobacillus johnsonii @/gm$ (@gm$ L.j @/gm$) and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B.p) was isolated and gifted by Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences and confirmed on the species level by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing (V4 sequences). E. coli (E.c) strain MG1655 (Biobw, China) was used as a negative control. E. coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) Medium (A507002 Sangon Biotech, China) at 37  C. @gm$ L.j @/gm$ and B.p were cultured in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) Medium (HB0384-5, hopebio, China) under an atmosphere of 10% H2, 10% CO2 and 80% N2 (AW500SG anaerobic workstations; ELECTROTEK, England).	0

aerogenes, can also produce considerable levels of @sm$ histamine @/sm$. Other microorganisms like Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus morganii were also reported as amino acid decarboxylase producers. Ground beef contaminated with Proteus morganii contained 595 mug of @sm$ histamine @/sm$ in 1 g, while the level of this amine in Proteus-free meat was about 8 mug/g. Amine-producing lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus brevis, L. buchneri, L. curvatus, L. carnis, L. divergens, and L. hilgardii have been isolated from meat and meat products. In salami, @sm$ histamine @/sm$ production has been associated with the presence of the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Citrobacter freundii, and @gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$ and Gram-positive microorganisms including micrococci and staphylococci.	1

This finding is also consistent with the result obtained in previous studies. Interestingly, high percentages of resistance were observed among staphylococcal isolates which exerted resistance against all tested antibiotics, including FQs and @sm$ FUS @/sm$, which are the 2 major antibiotics used in cases of severe corneal ulcers in Thailand. @sm$ FUS @/sm$ is a narrow spectrum antibiotic primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria including MRS.	4
agalactiae, @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ and V. parahaemolyticus:but no detectable activity against E. coli, V. alginolyticus, E. tarda, C. freundii, and V. vulnificus. The @sm$ methanol @/sm$, chloroform, and petroleum ether extracts of the seeds demonstrate growth inhibitory effect against H. pylori, while the ethyl acetate extract against E. coli, but no effect on S. typhi, S. sonnei, and S. typhimurium. The antimicrobial activity of P. speciosa is attributable to the presence of cyclic polysulfides 85 and 92-94 in the seeds. However, possible mechanism of the polysulfides was not elucidated. Both pod extract and its synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibit antibacterial activity, with the latter shows higher activity against P. aeruginosa. A similar antibacterial activity is also seen with aqueous extract of P. speciosa leaves and its silver nanoparticles against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Its bark @sm$ methanol @/sm$ extract inhibits the growth of Gloeophyllum trabeum, but not Pycnoporus sanguineus, which effect is not seen with both sapwood and heartwood of the plant.	3

When C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees C on Sabouraud dextrose agar, only C. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with F. nucleatum ATCC 49256 and no C. albicans strains showed CoAg. However, when the C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees C, both C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains demonstrated CoAg with @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. Heating the C. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees C) at 85 degrees C for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the C. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees C to coaggregate with @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. CoAg at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by EDTA or @sm$ arginine @/sm$. The CoAg reaction between @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and the Candida species involved a heat-labile component on @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the Candida species. The CoAg reactions between @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and the Candida species may be important in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the CoAg of C. dubliniensis by @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ when grown at 37 degrees C provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate C.	0

Studies conducted on Agrobacterium tumefaciens showed that the FAD-dependent glucoside-3-dehydrogenase, most likely present in the periplasmic space of the bacterium, converts disaccharides, such as @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ to 3-keto-sucrose, which is then transported inside the cell. The cytoplasmic enzyme, 3-ketoglucosidase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3-keto sucrose to form fructose and 3-keto-d-glucose (5), which in turn gets reduced to glucose by the NADPH-dependent 3-ketoglucose reductase. Ampomah et. al, reported that the thuEFGKAB operon found in A. tumefaciens was responsible for the transport of various disaccharides in their 3-keto forms. Disruption of thuAB genes affected the bacterium's ability to utilize @sm$ sucrose @/sm$ as a carbon source, but the mutant was able to grow on other disaccharides such as trehalose, @sm$ sucrose @/sm$, cellobiose, and lactose, indicating that the bacterium has multiple pathways dedicated to the transport and utilization of disaccharides.	2

and @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ relative to distal pipes without convective mixing, it is important to note that under other operating conditions the opposite effect is expected to occur. For instance, in later experiments using the same experimental systems, we introduced a 0.42 +- 0.05 mg/L (as total Cl2) chloramine residual to both water heaters. After a typical stagnation period, chloramine concentrations in the recirculating lines were 0.28 +- 0.08 mg/L. In low use downward oriented taps with no convective mixing, the residual decayed to 0.06 +- 0.02 mg/L while pipes with convective mixing maintained 0.13 +- 0.02 mg/L of chloramine delivered from the recirculating line. Under this scenario, convective mixing would be expected to decrease the ability for Legionella and @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ to regrow relative to pipes without convective mixing due to the increased presence of chloramine.

These isolates were resistant to 97% of @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, 94.4% of the cephalosporin group, 83.3% of beta-lactams, 75% of quinolones, 66.6% of tetracycline and oxytetracycline, 33.3% of imipenem and 50% of the other antibiotics tested.	4
bicolor, has a typical stem composition consisting of cellulose, lignin, and the hemicellulose @sm$ arabinoxylan @/sm$. Therefore, we focused our attention on the relative abundance of xylan epitopes as detected by 14 antibodies that recognize a wide range of xylan epitopes. To further examine the effect of bacterial inoculation, we the assessed the difference between each of the five inoculated replicates, and calculated the mean of the uninoculated ELISA values for each genotype. These values are an estimate of polysaccharide conversion by @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$. The antibody groups xylan-1 and xylan-2 tended not to change between treatment or genotype, or did not bind to the wall at all. Even though xylans were present in the 1 mol/l and 4 mol/l KOH-extractable fractions, only very small changes were seen after inoculation, regardless of genotype. However, within the oxalate-extractable fraction, the xylan-4 antibodies detected a significantly smaller change in wild-type xylan compared with the bmr-6 mutant xylan (Figure 4A). In the carbonate-extractable fraction, there was a smaller effect of inoculation, as detected by the xylan-3b antibodies, on the wild-type plant than on the bmr-6 and bmr-6/bmr-12 mutants (Figure 4B), and a smaller effect of inoculation, as detected by the xylan-4 antibodies, on the wild-type plant than on the bmr-12 and bmr-6/bmr-12 mutants (Figure 4B). Overall, the changes in extractable polysaccharide epitopes of the cell-wall fractions indicate that loosely integrated xylans and pectins are the primary polysaccharide targets of @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$, and that these are more accessible in the bmr mutants than in the wild type.	2

bovis cultures were glucose, @sm$ maltose @/sm$, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. In addition to these oligosaccharides, B. fibrisolvens cultures produced maltopentaose. The products of starch hydrolysis by @gm$ B. ruminicola @/gm$ were even more complex, yielding glucose through maltotetraose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose but little maltopentaose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 grew poorly on starch, digested only a small portion of the available substrate, and generated no detectable oligosaccharides as a result of cultivation in starch containing medium. S. ruminantium was able to grow on a mixture of maltooligosaccharides and utilize those of lower degree (less than 10) of polymerization. A coculture system containing S. ruminantium as a dextrin-utilizing species and each of the three amylolytic bacteria was developed to test whether the products of starch hydrolysis were available for crossfeeding to another ruminal bacterium. Cocultures of S. ruminantium and S. bovis contained large numbers of S. bovis but relatively few S. ruminantium and exhibited little change in the pattern of maltooligosaccharides observed for pure cultures of S. bovis. In contrast, S. ruminantium was able to compete with B. fibrisolvens and @gm$ B. ruminicola @/gm$ for these growth substrates. When grown with B. fibrisolvens, S. ruminantium grew to high numbers and maltooligosaccharides accumulated to a much lesser degree than in cultures of B. fibrisolvens alone. S. ruminantium-@gm$ B. ruminicola @/gm$ cultures contained large numbers of both species, and maltooligosaccharides never accumulated in these cocultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).	2
breve 12L, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 22L and @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ @gm$ JCM1207 @/gm$ supports the growth of Bi. bifidum PRL2010. Furthermore, metabolic activity of Bi. bifidum PRL2010 was enhanced when co-cultivated with these other bifidobacterial strains, and transcription of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was enhanced. When grown in monoculture, Bi. bifidum PRL2010 was unable to utilise @sm$ starch @/sm$ or xylan; however, the growth of PRL2010 was observed when this strain was cultivated together with Bi. breve 12L or Bi. adolescentis 22L. Conversely, a decrease in the growth of Bi. breve 12L and Bi. thermophilum @gm$ JCM1207 @/gm$ was noted, suggesting that the utilisation of @sm$ starch @/sm$ or xylan by Bi. bifidum PRL2010, respectively, did not benefit these strains and in fact imposed competitive pressure on these strains. The reduction in lactate and acetate production by Bi. breve 12L when grown in co-culture as opposed to monoculture supports the idea that the growth of this strain is hindered by the presence of another Bifidobacterium species. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the genes encoding an ABC-transporter and an MFS transporter in Bi. bifidum PRL2010 was upregulated when grown in co-culture. It was suggested that this upregulation was due to the production of simple carbohydrates by Bi. breve 12L and Bi. adolescentis 22L, which act as PBPs that can be utilised by Bi. bifidum PRL2010. Interestingly, upregulation of 21 genes of Bi. breve 12L was observed when co-cultures with Bi. bifidum PRL2010 on @sm$ starch @/sm$, and 42 genes when grown on xylan.	2
bromii and @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ in batch culture with resistant starch as the energy source (RUM-RS) resulted in a major increase in the yield of acetate when compared with the R. bromii monoculture, while no formate was detected in co-culture (Fig. 1B). The gradual increase in soluble reducing sugar that was seen in R. bromii monocultures was absent in co-culture (Fig. 1C and D) suggesting that @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ was able to utilize sugars released from RS by R. bromii . In addition, the co-culture gave rise to the branched chain fatty acids iso-butyrate and iso-valerate at concentrations not seen in the R. bromii monoculture on starch or in @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ monoculture on glucose (Fig. 1A and B). This indicates that there was an increase in fermentation of branched chain amino acids by one of the two species in the co-culture. @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ can form the branched chain fatty acids, iso-butyrate and iso-valerate from branched chain amino acids (Rasmussen et al., 1988), in addition to the major fermentation products acetate, @sm$ lactate @/sm$ and ethanol.	1

bryantii is a close relative to pathogenic @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species such as @gm$ P. denticola @/gm$ and P. bivia that depend on the acquisition of iron, which is important for survival within the host. Enteroferrin, HmuY, TonB, and other outer membrane proteins were elevated in P. bryantii cultures containing Acet and iVal. This suggests a regulation of the iron import by supplementation of certain fatty acids or their derivatives. P. intermedia 17 showed an increase of a HmuY-like protein and a TonB-linked outer membrane receptor when iron sources were restricted. Iron deficiency in ruminants is rarely observed in adult ruminants and should not influence growth of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species in the rumen at proper feeding conditions. In the study of Herold, S., et al., an increase of TonB was found in a shiga-toxigenic E. coli when multiple SCFAs were supplemented. Another heme importing protein is hemolysin, which was increased in iVal and is usually also expressed under iron deficiency. Iron can be imported in connection to porphyrin or chelating agents such as citrate or enteroferrin. For some Prevotella sp., it was demonstrated that heme (an Fe3+ bound porphyrin) has to be present in a concentration of at least 10 nM in order to obtain sufficient growth.

The detection of carbapenemases among the E. coli isolates was scarce and conclusive results could not be obtained. However, in the @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ spp. collection, genotype/phenotype discrepancies could be explained by the predominance of the OXA-48 enzyme. OXA-48-type carbapenemases weakly hydrolyse @sm$ carbapenems @/sm$ and their recognition and detection based on phenotypic profiles can be difficult.	4

The HardyCHROM plates were incubated for 18-24 h at 37 C, while the Difco plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 C. Dilutions that yielded colony counts of 30-300 were used; the three replicates had colony counts performed and were averaged to determine the quantity of both E. coli and @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ at each time point. From the three plates that were used to determine the quantity of E. coli and Enterococcus, 8 isolates in total were randomly selected and were streaked for isolation onto Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) and incubated overnight at 37  C. After incubation, each suspected E. coli isolate was @sm$ indole @/sm$ tested (@sm$ Indole @/sm$ Reagent Kovacs, Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA).

Mutants incapable of metabolizing these seven carbohydrates have a decreased capacity to colonize streptomycin-treated mice. Although the mouse passage assay employed in this study did not evaluate colonization, the results from Phenotype Microarrays found that five of the seven carbohydrates identified by Chang et al. as preferred carbon sources were utilized by the hns mutant while the @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ parent strain used all seven carbon sources (see Tables 2 and 3).	2

A study conducted by Field et al., revealed the synergistic action of nisin V with carvacrol, thymol, and @sm$ cinnamaldehyde @/sm$ against L. monocytogenes in a model food system. Moreover, the combinations of nisin V with the antimicrobials showed better results against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the milk model. Yet, certain components present in the food matrix such as milk were reported to reduce the antimicrobial potential of the natural preservatives; the combination of nisin with natural preservatives showed promising activities. Furthermore, Ayari et al. (2016) investigated the combination of carvacrol and nisin in controlling @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ in food following gamma-ray irradiation. After incorporating antimicrobials at a lower concentration into the food product, the use of prior technology resulted in a substantial reduction in pathogen load.

compared the GM structural modulation of body weight and serum @sm$ glucose @/sm$ with two treatments: liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and saxagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor). The authors found that mice treated with liraglutide enriched the genera Allobacum (p = .004), and Turicibacter (p = 1.77e-8), the family Erysipelotrichaceae, specifically the genera Anaerostipes (p = 5.51e-5) and Blautia (p = .039), and the family Lachnospiraceae genus Lactobacillus (p = .013). These changes in GM composition were associated with a reduction in body weight in mice treated with liraglutide. In contrast, the GM composition in treatment with saxagliptin increased the abundance of some bacteria from the class Erysipelotrichaceae, such as Lactobacillus (p = .023), Allobaculum (p = .017), and Turicibacter (p = .001). Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteoridetes decreased, specifically the genera Bacteroides (p = .003) and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ (p = .018). The random @sm$ glucose @/sm$ concentration was lower in linagliptin-treated mice, p < .05. Liraglutide and saxagliptin were shown to enrich Lactobacillus and Turicibacter. Furthermore, Lactobacillus showed inhibitory activity against DPP-4, through increased incretins and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ homeostasis.	3

To improve the sensitivity of the created NMR biosensor, the authors adopted two signal amplification methods (a streptavidin-biotin system and a magnetic nanoparticle cluster), which led to a significant increase in the sensitivity of the created biosensor (Figure 10). The conclusion was made that the created biosensor could serve as a prospective instrument for the sensitive and fast detection of pathogens in samples of various origins. Zhao et al. developed a method for the accurate and reliable detection of @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ in food based on functionalized iron/@sm$ magnetite @/sm$ nanoconjugates, which change their properties depending on the binding of the antibody on the surface of the nanoparticles. It was shown that the specific binding of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ and antibody-modified nanoparticles leads to the aggregation of biofunctionalized MNPs, which entails the change in the relaxation time of surrounding nanoparticle water protons that could be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance. The high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidness of the method were shown in the detection of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ using NMR.	0

In Oerlemans' study, L. plantarum WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA 1, and L. rhamnosus GG were formulated in an innovative silicone gel at a dose of 9-10 log CFU/g. The lactobacilli remained viable over multiple months of storage at 5  C and 25  C. Moreover, the formulation was proven to be effective on VVC in clinic. The thermosensitive gel formulation was evidenced to enhance the viability of epithelial cells without affecting the morphology of the vaginal mucosa. In this study, a thermosensitive in situ gel formulation was developed for intravaginal delivery of @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$. The final gel consisted of @sm$ P407 @/sm$ at 26%, P188 at 8.86%, HA at 0.3%, FOS at 0.5%, and @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ at 11 log CFU/mL. @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ was proven to stay highly active for at least eight weeks in the formulation at 4  C.	0
difficile EriC associated with @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ resistance commonly carry a specific set of amino acids in the conserved anion selectivity filter region, which are distinct from validated chloride-specific EriC proteins (Table 1). In this study, two novel genes encoding EriC1b of S. mutans and EriC1 of S. anginosus were shown to be involved in @sm$ fluoride @/sm$-resistance, and subsequently seven EriC1s in other oral streptococci were predicted to be responsible for @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ resistance of these organisms based on amino acid sequence homology. Our table shows amino acid sequences of the conserved anion selectivity filter region of the 18 EriC homologs; 3 EriCs are Cl- channels and 15 EriCs are predicted to be F- channels. All EriC1s of oral streptococci possessed a similar set of amino acid sequences to those of the F- channel EriCs, but they were distinct from those of Cl- channel EriCs. Although it is possible that EriC1s in oral streptococci may be generally responsible for the @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ resistance, the role of EriC1s from oral streptococci other than S. mutans and S. anginosus in @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ resistance should be examined. The amino acid sequences of the region in the streptococci were more similar to those of C. difficile, Eubacterium ventriosum, and @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ EriCs than those of P.	4
difficile resistance levels to @sm$ cefoxitin @/sm$, cefotaxim, ertapemen, clindamycin and susceptibility levels to imipenem and tetracycline were as previously reported for strains isolated from hospitals. No resistance was observed to moxifloxacin, although it has been described at high frequencies, but one third of our strains were found to be intermediate. Resistance to amoxicillin and piperacillin was observed for @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ strains and was attributed to its specific beta-lactamase inhibited by clavulanic acid. Nevertheless, whereas antibiotic courses did not influence overall clostridia colonization, the PN exposed to antibiotics were more often colonized with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ species.	4

Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis and @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ were increased both in IBS and controls group with an adequate % energy of lipid and protein intake. Bacteroides spp. are considered important bacteria in maintaining intestinal health, because they strengthen the epithelial barrier and produce anti-inflammatory molecules such as polysaccharide A (PSA), sphingolipids and outer membrane vesicles (OMV).

P. distasonis, when transferred to mice, induces a Treg phenotype in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, germ-free mice transplanted with fecal samples from healthy donors had a higher abundance of @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ than MS fecal transplanted mice. Furthermore, healthy donor fecal transplanted mice developed a lower frequency of spontaneous EAE than mice transplanted with MS fecal samples. We found that mice on an @sm$ isoflavone @/sm$ diet showed an increase in abundances of P. distasonis and @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$, supporting previous reports that diet has a tremendous influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. In our study, we demonstrate that bacterial therapy with P. distasonis and @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$ results in markedly different clinical disease scores depending on the diet of the host. In the absence of @sm$ isoflavones @/sm$, these @sm$ isoflavone @/sm$-metabolizing bacteria may begin to metabolize host products, such as mucins, resulting in a proinflammatory state.	2

No effects of PUFAs were observed on gut microbiota. Moreover, the gut microbial modulation by arabinoxylan oligosaccharides was positively correlated with blood concentration of insulin, markers of lipid metabolism (@sm$ triglycerides @/sm$, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B), hepatic function (Alanine aminotransferase) as well as HOMA scale of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and HOMA scale of beta cell function (HOMA-beta).	0

Pure culture strains were isolated from patients admitted to Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) from 2001 to 2009.  Table 2 lists the Shigella spp. reference strains and other bacteria used in this study. Non-Shigella strains were used to determine the specificity and robustness of the assay.

dysenteriae Sd96.29 and Sd4105.65, and @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ Sb483 and Sb485 were selected as representatives of the diverse arrangements of the speG locus (Fig. 3 and Table S1) and grown in polyamine-free medium. Despite the high homology between Shigella and E. coli, the analysis reveals several relevant differences. In all Shigella strains analysed, putrescine and spermidine predominate, while @sm$ cadaverine @/sm$, spermidine and acetylspermidine are absent (Table 2). The absence of @sm$ cadaverine @/sm$ in Shigella is well documented and is considered as a major pathoadaptive mutation. The absence of endogenous spermine is not surprising since it has been reported also in E. coli , which is considered as the commensal ancestor of Shigella . As far as spermidine is concerned, interestingly its concentration in Shigella was found to be approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than in E. coli MG1655. This is almost certainly due to speG inactivation and, consequently, to the lack of conversion of spermidine to acetylspermidine. Finally, the polyamine patterns observed in S. flexneri SfZM49 and @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ Sb485 indicate that, despite the presence of specific bands in Southern blot assays (data not shown), speG is inactive in these strains too.	2
dysenteriae and @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ accounted for less than 3% of the isolates. Antibiotic resistance among Salmonella for @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$, tetracycline and chloramphenicol was 13%, 19% and 5%, respectively. Most resistant isolates were serogroup B. Overall, 40% of Shigella isolates were resistant to @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$, 15% resistant to tetracycline and 4% resistant to chloramphenicol.	4
enterica, @gm$ E. coli @/gm$), exogenous @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is converted to AcCoA by either the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (Acs) enzyme or the AckA/Pta pathway. However, there is no reported evidence that in S. aureus Acs is involved in @sm$ acetate @/sm$ assimilation. Recently, others showed that when S. aureus is exposed to high @sm$ acetate @/sm$ concentrations growth is inhibited because of intracellular acidification and the generaton of reaction oxygen species (ROS), eventually leading to cell death. Thus, a means of regulating the levels of intracellular @sm$ acetate @/sm$ appears to be necessary for proper growth. Here we report that in S. aureus HG001, the BSR30_RS08905 gene directs the synthesis of a bona fide enzyme that activates @sm$ acetate @/sm$ to AcCoA in vitro (hereafter referred to as SaAcs).	2
enterocolitica 09) differing in the presence of the calcium-dependence plasmid, as well as @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ mutants resistant to @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$, nalidixic acid or crystal violet without this plasmid, have revealed that the invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the infective agents are not directly related to the presence of the above-mentioned plasmid in these bacteria.	4
enterocolitica strains were biotyped based on tween esterase activity, indole production, and xylose and @sm$ trehalose @/sm$ fermentation. All 50 strains were serotyped with commercial antisera (Sifin, Berlin, Germany): 38 Y. enterocolitica strains against O:3 and O:9 and 12 @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ strains against O:1.	2
established the synthesis of 71 and 72 from cyanosafracin B, which is an antibiotic obtained from fermentation of the bacterium @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$. The methoxy-p-quinone of cyanosafracin B was treated with bromochloromethane, followed by Edman degradation to form thiourea (Scheme 13). The critical substitution of the amino group by an @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ group gave the key intermediate to yield 71 through the Corey method.	1
eutactus, @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$, R. flavefaciens and B. pullicaecorum and by an increase in the concentration of fecal butyrate. In conclusion, the consumption of BB can be recommended to prevent insulin resistance and metabolic endotoxemia by modifying the gut microbiota. Finally, the groups fed BB showed lower abundance of hepatic FMO-3, even with a high-fat diet protecting against the production of @sm$ TMAO @/sm$ and obesity.	1
evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance determinants of 79 clinical isolates of @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ and 26 of R. planticola collected from 65 patients from a university hospital in Poland. Overall, susceptibility to all tested antimicrobials was high (>=81.9%), except for amoxicillin/clavulanate (9.5% susceptible; 59.1% intermediate). For beta-lactams, the highest susceptibility was observed for imipenem (99%), followed by meropenem (98.1%), and cefepime (88.6%). Regarding non-beta-lactams, the highest susceptibility was observed for gentamicin (93.3%) and @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ (92.4%). Fourteen isolates (nine @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ and five R.	3
examined the influence of physiologically relevant doses of @sm$ CBD @/sm$, CBN, and THC (1.0 mug/ml) on the immune response induced by oral pathogens, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$, Filifactor alocis, and Treponema denticola. @sm$ CBD @/sm$, CBN, and THC exhibited the suppression of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-induced cytokines while enhancing interleukin 10 (IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine). Similar responses with the phytocannabinoids were also seen in F. alocis- and T. denticola-exposed human monocytes and human gingival keratinocytes. Interestingly, phytocannabinoid doses >=5.0 mug/ml compromised cell viability, but efficiently inhibited the growth of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ and F. alocis. Additionally, in a transient oral infection model, @sm$ CBD @/sm$ was able to suppress @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-induced innate immune markers in wild-type mice, but not in CB2R-deficient mice (Gu et al., ).	3
fabricated ethylcellulose microsponges of @sm$ dapsone @/sm$ using the quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion method, further incorporated into Carbopol to make a topical gel formulation. Bacterial strains like Staphylococcus aureus and @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ that cause acne were used for evaluation of therapeutic activity against acne.	3
faecalis; brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and agar were used for the growth of @gm$ B. viscericola @/gm$. Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth and agar were used for culturing L. johnsonni. B. dorei strains were grown in Tryptone Yeast Glucose (TYG) broth containing tryptone peptone (1 g), bacto yeast extract (0.5 g), glucose (0.2 g), cysteine (free base) (0.05 g), 1 M KPO4 pH 7.2 (10 ml), Vitamin K solution, 1 mg/ml (1 ml), TYG salts (4 ml), 0.8% @sm$ CaCl2 @/sm$ (0.1 ml), FeSO4, 0.4 mg/ml (0.1 ml), resazurin, 0.25 mg/ml (0.4 ml) and H2O (85 ml). Prior to culturing, haematin (w/v %) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% w/v. E. coli and E. faecalis were grown aerobically while B. dorei, L. johnsonii and @gm$ B. viscericola @/gm$ were cultivated on plates contained in an anaerobic jar (Anaerocult  system, VWR International, U.K.).	0
faecis, @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, and P. copri) which carry out anti-inflammatory functions were found to have positive associations with M. smithii, hinting at mutualistic/syntrophic versus antagonistic relationships between gut bacteria and archaea. A prominent example of bacterial-archaeal syntrophism was previously established for Ruminococcus and methanogens, where the methanogens consume H2, allowing Ruminococcus to produce twice as many ATP molecules from the same amount of substrate. From our data, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$, and Methanobrevibacter may form a syntrophic guild specified for the degradation of starches and complex polysaccharides contained in rural and ethnic diets, as well as for SCFA generation and depletion of gut H2. This is also reflected in our observation that rural residents had an increased abundance of SCFA (pyruvate) fermentation module in the gut archaeome, compared to urban residents. Prevotella assists in breaking down carbohydrate/fiber-rich foods into simpler sugars (poly- and monosaccharides) and other products (such as succinate) to be fermented by bacteria such as Ruminococcus and @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$. Fermentation byproducts (including H2 and acetate-/H+) produced would then be consumed by Methanobrevibacter with the subsequent production of CO2 and/or @sm$ CH4 @/sm$.	1
firmus, @gm$ B. lentus @/gm$ and B. badius (SSM = 80.14%). The most discriminating tests were selected to differentiate the clusters from the subgroups. The feature with the highest discriminating power between clusters A and B was the lack of acid production from arabinose and mannitol. The Voges-Proskauer, methyl red tests and sensitivity to polymyxin B clearly distinguished cluster A from C. The Voges-Proskauer test and acid production from arabinose were the best to differentiate between B and C. Bacillus pumilus and B. subtilis differed in starch hydrolysis and B. licheniformis in growing anaerobically. To discriminate B. firmus from @gm$ B. lentus @/gm$ the most important tests were the acid production from @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and sucrose; intermediate strains were found. Bacillus badius was differentiated from B. firmus by 10 tests, and from @gm$ B. lentus @/gm$ by the production of urease.	2
first described a simple and rapid method for BLPs preparation, which is still in use to date: @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ are boiled in hot acid for 30 minutes. This procedure deprives the entire intracellular contents of bacterial cells including proteins, nucleic acids and lipophosphatidic acids and extracellular macromolecules. And the degradation products and acid will be removed by washing with buffer three times. It has been found that hot @sm$ HCl @/sm$, TCA or H2SO4 treatment led to successful BLPs production, and the acid concentration of 10% is the best. After treatment, the resulting hollow particles essentially are @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) shell which retain their original shape and size (1-2 mum) after treatment. This method is generally applicable to gram-positive bacteria, not only for @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$. Apart from @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$, the peptidoglycan backbones of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum are also resistant to hot acid treatment and can also be successfully prepared into BLPs.	3
flavefaciens, @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$, and M. gottschalkii are shown in Figure 5. While M. gottschalkii could produce biotin, nitrite, and octadecanoate at a high rate, @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ became less reliant on these metabolites after addition of viral AMGs, possibly due to the complementation in the galacturonan and pectin digestion ability and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Galacturonate and Deoxyadenosine were not consumed by R. flavefaciens at the same rate they were being produced by @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ because R. flavefaciens was able to digest the complex carbohydrates in the plant feed more efficiently after addition of viral AMGs. The transfer of @sm$ mannose @/sm$ and fructose sugars to M. gottschalkii from R. flavefaciens was not identified as interactions, which ultimately resulted in reduction of the number of de novo interactions in the community to 20 when viral AMGs were present. Upon inspection of the functionalities coming from the phages associated with M. gottschalkii, it became apparent that the D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate glycolaldehyde transferase and D-mannose-6-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase system that drive the conversion between fructose and @sm$ mannose @/sm$ became unnecessary in the presence of virome functionalities in the models.	2
flavefaciens, Butryvibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, @gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$, Ruminiobacter amylophilus; Wang et al., 2019). Also, enhanced production of BCVFA has been observed in RUSITEC supplied with high levels of free amino acids (Gresner, Wichern, Lumpp, Hoedemaker, & Holtershinken, 2015). Plant-mediated proteolysis generates @sm$ peptides @/sm$ and amino acids (Beha et al., 2002). Microbial assimilation of amino acids precedes degradation to ammonia or BCVFA and use in microbial protein synthesis. Where fast plant-mediated proteolysis occurs, there is an abundance of plant-derived @sm$ peptides @/sm$ and amino acids.	2
fluorescens, @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$), and Firmicutes (S. agalactiae, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, E. faecalis) and examined their genomes in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database (http://img.jgi.doe.gov). Bacteria can generate arginine through several different pathways (Figure 1). One pathway is the conversion of glutamine to arginine. Glutamine can be converted to glutamate and @sm$ ammonia @/sm$ (@sm$ NH3 @/sm$) by EC 3.5.1.2 (glutaminase) then to citrulline via EC 2.7.2.2 (carbamate kinase) and EC 2.1.3.3 (ornithine carbamoyltransferase) (Figure 2a). We examined the enzymes required for this multi-step conversion of glutamine to citrulline in the selected enteric bacterial genomes. We calculated the percentage of bacteria within a certain species that possessed a given EC based on the number of bacterial genomes that had the EC of interest, divided by the total number of bacterial genomes of that species (see Equation 1) (Figure 2b). We found that >80% of E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. epidermidis, S. aureus and E. faecalis genomes in the database encoded the enzymes necessary to convert glutamine to citrulline. The bacteria K. pneumoniae, @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$, and S.	1
formicigeneransT, and of 58.9% to @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$. GTDB-Tk supported placement of the type strain, Sanger_02, as a member of the Dorea. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to D. formicigeneransT was only 92.7%. Higher similarity values were obtained to members of the Faecalicatena genus: F. contortaT (96.6%) and F. fissicatena (96.1%). However, POCP values to these species' genomes were below 50% and above 50% to both D. formicigeneransT (56.2%) and @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ (58.9%). These values confirm that strain Sanger_02 is a novel species of Dorea. Separation from the species 'D. acetigenes' and 'D. amylophila' was confirmed via an ANI values of 82.2% and 80.6%, respectively, between the genomes of the type strains. The genome contained 125 CAZymes, facilitating the predicted utilisation of both starch and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ as carbon sources.	2
formulated gelatin-PCL-based electrospun nanofibers encapsulated trimethoxysilylpropyl octadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (@sm$ QAS @/sm$) (used as an antibiotic) for antibacterial wound dressing. The mechanical performance analysis of nanofibers showed that the tensile strength in the range of 9-12 MPa fulfills the clinical requirements of 1-2 MPa. The in vitro antibacterial experiments of antibiotic-loaded nanofibers displayed more than 99% bactericidal activity against @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ and S.	3
fortuitum strain (ATCC 6841) and @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ strain Hauduroy (@gm$ ATCC 12478 @/gm$) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection http://www.atcc.org. M. bovis BCG Pasteur strain was obtained from the Trudeau Culture Collection (Saranac Lake, New York, United States). GFF-expressing BCG and M. smegmatis were generated by subcloning the enhanced GFP gene (Clonetech, http://www.clonetech.com) into the mycobacterial episomal expression vector pMV261. The resulting plasmid (pYU921) was transfected into competent cells by electroporation as previously described (Snapper et.al,). M. smegmatis was cultured in LB broth with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% @sm$ dextrose @/sm$, and 0.05% TWEEN-80. M. fortuitum, @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$, and M. bovis BCG were cultured in 7H9 broth with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% @sm$ dextrose @/sm$, and 0.05% TWEEN-80, and 10% ADC enrichment.	2
found statistically significant differences in Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Parabacteroides, and @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ among 76 constipated and healthy children in a comparative analysis of their intestinal flora. Enterorhabdus is considered one of the human intestinal pathogens that participates in the fermentation of undigested proteins in the intestinal tract and may destroy intestinal homeostasis. Its products, ammonia and @sm$ putrescine @/sm$, are closely related to the occurrence of colorectal cancer.	1
found that caprylic acid (C8:0) downregulated the serum levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and increased the abundance of Lachnoclostridium, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, and Prevotella_9, activating GPR43 and improving intestinal permeability. Capric acid (C10:0) can upregulate GPR84 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). @sm$ Dodecanoic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ C12:0 @/sm$), also known as @sm$ lauric acid @/sm$, can improve insulin sensitivity.	0
found that dietary @sm$ fructose @/sm$, and no other dietary macronutrients, impacted microbiota, with a significant inverse association between @sm$ fructose @/sm$ and Eubacterium eligens and @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$, two beneficial microbes considered to have anti-inflammatory properties and promote gut health. Rodent studies using high-@sm$ fructose @/sm$ diets have observed dramatic shifts in microbial colonies, increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, reductions in anti-inflammatory cytokines, lipid accumulation in the liver, and neuroinflammation.	2
found that the occurrence of alcoholic fatty liver was associated with altered gut microbiota, while found that the long-chain saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid, @sm$ stearic acid @/sm$) in Jinhua ham could prevent chronic alcohol-associated liver damage (ALD), and the preventive effect was associated with increased gut Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus. found that @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ could degrade the cumulative nicotine in the intestine, and prevent the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).	0
fragilis GH35 (BF4061) was upregulated when grown on mucin compared to on @sm$ glucose @/sm$. Our phylogenetic analysis of GH35 enzymes of mucin degraders reveals some very closely related enzymes from Bacteroides (Supplementary Figure S6). One large cluster of Bacteroides GH35 contains enzymes from Bacteroides intestinalis, B. uniformis, B. thetaiotaomicron, P. vulgatus, B. fragilis, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, B.	2
fumigatus (strain M142650-2) that were isolated from drinking water distribution systems in the Netherlands during a previous study and with a type strain of @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ (ATCC 25221) that was kindly provided by Dr. Jakko van Ingen (RadboudUMC, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The selected strains of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. fumigatus were pre-grown in mineral medium with added @sm$ glucose @/sm$ (0.25 mg/L) and KNO3 (6 mg/L) until nutrients were depleted, whereas @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ was pre-grown in rich medium.	2
gallolyticus, @gm$ S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus @/gm$, and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. These can be identified according to differential biochemical reactions. Among these biochemical tests, tannase activity was only described in S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains. Only strains from this subspecies hydrolyze methyl gallate (tannase activity) and decarboxylate @sm$ gallic acid @/sm$ to pyrogallol (Figure 1).	1
gasseri, as well as @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, all carry multiple (at least three) genes for GHs that would allow for their direct utilization of glycogen. Together, these studies contradict the previous theory that glycogen can only be used by vaginal bacteria when it has been broken down by human alpha-amylase. Further confirmation that vaginal bacteria carry functional glycogen-digesting enzymes has come from characterization of amylopullanases from L. crispatus, L. iners and @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$. Each of the enzymes encoded by the different species we tested utilize glycogen (among others) as a substrate, cleaving it to maltose, maltotriose, malto-oligosaccharides, @sm$ trehalose @/sm$, limit dextrin and/or glucose, depending on the specific enzyme (BRENDA database, https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php, accessed 20 Feb 2023).	2
gingivalis and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. Additionally, the digestion of T. forsythia growth promoting factors by gingipains from P. gingivalis promoted the latter's growth. P. gingivalis and T. denticola association also enabled synergistic growth in response to a combination of their respective growth-stimulating factors @sm$ isobutyric acid @/sm$ and succinic acid.	2
gingivalis and @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$, together with administration of the oral carcinogen @sm$ 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide @/sm$ (@sm$ 4NQO @/sm$), promoted transformation of oral squamous carcinogenic cells and increased signaling along the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis. This in turn induced effectors driving growth and invasiveness of cells from OSCC. The findings agreed with other reports showing that IL-6 signaling and STAT3 activity are pro-tumorigenic. The production of IL-6 in epithelial cells was increased by P. gingivalis activating the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) pathways. Results by Binder Gallimidi et al. indicated that P. gingivalis and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ stimulate tumorigenesis by direct interaction with oral epithelial cells through activation of Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) causing IL-6 production from the epithelial cells.	3
gingivalis and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ as well as A. actinomycetemcomitans, a molar incisor grade IV periodontitis was isolated on the selective media as described previously. The bacterial strains were further incubated in an anaerobic jar (Don Whitley Scientific Ltd., West Yorkshire, UK) with an environment having 10% carbon dioxide, 10% @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ and 80% nitrogen at 37  C for 3-7 days.	2
gnavus, @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$, R. lactaris, S. salivarius, B. fragilis and E. faecalis growth, overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in appropriate media and 100 muL was dispensed per well in 96-well plates (low evaporation lid, Costar 3370). Controls (0.4% DMSO) and metabolites (PEA, @sm$ OEA @/sm$, LEA or AEA) at final concentrations of 50 muM and 100 muM were tested in triplicate.	3
hPDLCs were pre-treated with @sm$ E2 @/sm$, ICI or psoralen (12.5 mug/mL) for 2 h and then stimulated by 1 mug/mL @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-LPS for 24 h.	3
harveyi (45.5%, n = 10), @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ (22.7%, n = 5), V. cholerae (13.6%, n = 3), V. mimicus (9.1%, n = 2), and V. vulnificus (9.1%, n = 2). Three of the six virulent genes screened were positively amplified; four @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ possessed the tdh (18.18%) and trh (18.18%) genes, while the zot gene was harboured by 3 V. cholerae (13.64%) and one V. mimicus (4.55%) isolate. Isolates revealed high levels of resistance to @sm$ cephalothin @/sm$ (95.45%), ampicillin (77.27%), and streptomycin (40.91%), while lower resistances (4.55%-27.27%) were recorded for other antimicrobials. Sixteen (72.7%) isolates displayed multiple antibiotic-resistant properties. Cluster analysis of antibiotic resistance revealed a closer relationship between Vibrio isolates from different sampling sites. The Vibrio species displayed biofilm formation potentials at 37 C (63.6, n = 14), 35 C (50%, n = 11), and 25 C (36.4%, n = 8). Two phages isolated in this study (vB_VpM_SA3V and vB_VcM_SA3V) were classified as belonging to the family Myoviridae based on electron microscopy. These were able to lyse multidrug-resistant @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ and V.	4
hirae-specific and @gm$ B. intestinihominis @/gm$-specific Th1 immune responses are correlated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) in chemotherapy-treated patients. Currently, the potential use of microbes, metabolites or enzymes in treatment outcome prediction is being extensively investigated, such as examining beta-glucuronidase level to predict @sm$ CPT-11 @/sm$-induced toxicity.	0
hydrophila prevailed both of human origin (44%) and water creek samples (41%), while @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ ranked first among raw chicken samples (65%). Dilution testing by Agar Method was performed to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), following NCCLS standards. All tested microorganisms were susceptible to third generation cephalosporin, cefepime, @sm$ imipenem @/sm$, aztreonam, and resistant to ampicillin.	3
indicum collected from Nakhon Pathom province (OFNE) exhibited the strongest antibacterial effects against all four tested pathogenic bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus intermedius, @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-Escherichia coli, whereas the other five extracts promoted low inhibitory effects. Baicalin was found to be the active constituent for antibacterial activity, whereas @sm$ baicalein @/sm$ and chrysin promoted a lower, inhibitory effect, except for P. aeruginosa for which chrysin and @sm$ baicalein @/sm$ showed IC97 values of 1.81 and 5.99 mg/mL, respectively.	3
infantis ATCC 15697 co-ferments limiting concentrations of glucose or @sm$ lactose @/sm$ and excess fucose, as well as free fucose, fermentative intermediates were profiled to clarify the fucose utilization pathway. A mechanistic pathway (Supplementary Figure 6) was proposed by Bunesova et al and supported by James et al in Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense and @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$.	2
influenzae, which confers resistance to ampicillin, @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ and tetracycline. Prior to 1972, H. influenzae was universally susceptible to ampicillin. In 1972, the first ampicillin-resistant isolate was detected and soon afterwards tetracycline, @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$, erythromycin and multiple antibiotics-resistant strains were identified that spread rapidly around the globe. Recent work has shown that a novel GI-like lineage of T4SSs plays a key role in the dissemination of the antibiotic resistance element ICEHin1056 among @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ spp. Several genes of the GI T4SS of H. influenzae harboured transmembrane domains and signal peptide sequences, features typical for genes involved in T4SS (Table 1). Mutation analysis showed that inactivation of key genes of the ICEHin1056 T4SS resulted in a loss of phenotypic traits provided by a T4SS. Several mutants with a mutation in this T4SS did not produce the type IV secretion pilus and had up to 100 000-fold reduced conjugation frequencies compared with the parent strain (; Table 1). In a subsequent study investigating the sequence and functional properties of various @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ spp. genomic islands, the GI-like T4SS module was found to be among the most conserved parts of seven genomic islands tested, with DNA similarity ranging from 95% to 100% between islands. Furthermore, results from this study suggest that GI T4SSs of all @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$ genomic islands tested play a key role in the formation of the pilus and conjugative transfer of DNA.	4
intermedius was most frequently isolated (15 of 62 canals; 24%) followed by @gm$ B. denticola @/gm$ which was present in 12 cases. Asaccharolytic BP Bacteroides species, B. gingivalis and B. endodontalis, were found in eight cases. BP Bacteroides species were found both from symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, but there were also several symptomatic cases from which BP Bacteroides species were not isolated. B. gingivalis and B. endodontalis were present only in acute infections, B. intermedius was found both in symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, and @gm$ B. denticola @/gm$ occurred mostly in asymptomatic infections. BP Bacteroides species were isolated initially from 9 of the 11 teeth with symptoms at 1 week, but only from 22 of the 51 teeth that were symptomless at 1 week. Two strains of @gm$ B. denticola @/gm$ were resistant to penicillin G at a concentration of 2.4 micrograms/ml, but the MIC of penicillin G for all other strains was 0.6 micrograms/ml or lower. Forty-two randomly selected patients received @sm$ penicillin V @/sm$ (oral administration, 650 mg, three times daily) during the first week of endodontic therapy.	4

investigated the production of BAs by RP-HPLC of 22 antibiotic-sensitive and nontoxigenic @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ isolates and reported that none of them produced cadaverine, @sm$ putrescine @/sm$, or histamine under the experimental conditions used, although 12 isolates produced 2-phenylethylamine in concentrations ranging between 2.6 and 15.0 mg/L, which were much lower than those found in the present study. On the contrary, Bermudez et al. reported concentrations of @sm$ putrescine @/sm$ of 1415 and 977 mg/L for two isolates of S.	1
kansasii and @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and the occasionally pathogenic M. gordonae and M. bovis. The anticoagulant used in blood extraction, @sm$ heparin @/sm$ or EDTA, had a major influence in the outcome of the infection. Thus, while in the heparinized models a similar number of bacteria were enumerated in the inoculum and after seven days, in the presence of EDTA a killing effect was observed, despite the inhibitory effect of EDTA on cellular functions like the production of cytokines or reactive oxygen species (ROS). A special case was the rapidly growing mycobacteria @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, that multiplied in heparinized models but was eliminated in models with EDTA.	3
lactis, Bacillus coagulans, @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ butiricum and Streptococcus thermophilus. Typically, both approaches involving the administration of a single strain or a mixture of strains are equally effective. Some probiotics are mixed with pharmaceutical aids, such as maltodextrin and @sm$ starch @/sm$, or prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and inulin, which, in the latter cases, are qualified as synbiotics.	2

ljungdahlii grown on @sm$ CO @/sm$ and H2 at various initial gas pressures. It is well understood that the microbial growth and product distribution of microorganism during gas fermentation can be significantly affected by the partial pressure of the gas components, as the enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway of the organism is sensitive to substrate exposure. In most studies conducted so far, the composition of gas was selected in a way that only one component was the dominant substrate. In those cases, a single substrate growth model is utilized to determine the biokinetic parameters. Phillips et al. grew C. ljungdahlii in batch cultures with H2/CO2 or @sm$ CO @/sm$/CO2 as the growth substrates to assess the influence of substrate on fermentation parameters used in process design. They concluded that @sm$ CO @/sm$ provided a higher specific growth rate (mu = 0.06 h-1), whereas H2 brought about a higher specific uptake rate (q = 0.079 mol/gcell/h). Vega et al. obtained the fermentation parameters of @gm$ Peptostreptococcus productus @/gm$ on gaseous substrates (@sm$ CO @/sm$, H2/CO2). Based on the achieved results it was deduced that only @sm$ CO @/sm$ was consumed for the growth, whereas @sm$ CO @/sm$ and CO2/H2 were utilized for production of acetate. They used some kinetic models including substrate inhibition to determine the biokinetic parameters; the results were mu max = 0.21 h-1 and q max = 144 mmol/gcell/h with @sm$ CO @/sm$ inhibitory effects on cell growth (P @sm$ CO @/sm$ L > 60 kPa) and gas uptake (P @sm$ CO @/sm$ L > 80 kPa).	2
longbeachae NSW150 we identified two gene clusters encoding proteins that are predicted to be involved in production of @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ (@sm$ LPS @/sm$) and/or capsule (Figure 3). Neither shared homology with the L. pneumophila @sm$ LPS @/sm$ biosynthesis gene cluster. One region of 48 kb spans from llo3148 to llo3180 (Figure 3A) and the second of 24 kb from llo0217 to llo0236 (Figure 3B). In total they contain 26 genes for synthesis of the nucleotide sugar precursor, 12 genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases, 5 polysaccharide translocation genes including homologs of the ctrABCD capsule transport operon of N. meningitidis, and 10 genes of unknown function (Table S4). The finding that @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$ might be encapsulated was further substantiated by electron microscopy analysis.	1
longicatena and @gm$ C. comes @/gm$ were positively correlated with obesity, which was consistent with our findings. B. thetaiotaomicron, a healthy marker species which was negatively related to obese parameters in their study, was also increased after LSG in our study. However, we found that D. longicatena and B. thetaiotaomicron were not correlated with VFA. Consistent with their findings, we also found that the capacity of @sm$ L-glutamate @/sm$ and L-glutamine biosynthesis was highly enriched in the obese microbiome. We further found that the capacity of @sm$ L-glutamate @/sm$ and L-glutamine biosynthesis was positively correlated with VFA. After LSG, @sm$ L-glutamate @/sm$ degradation pathway increased. @sm$ L-glutamate @/sm$ is used to produce monosodium glutamate (MSG), a commonly used food additive that contributes to metabolic disorders. Our results suggested that @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ biosynthesis of gut microbiota might be an influencing factor of visceral fat accumulation.	1
longum and @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$. Moreover, the adapted strains showed higher resistance to bile salts (1-3%), @sm$ NaCl @/sm$ (6-10%), and high temperatures (60-70 C), besides a higher fermentative ability and enzymatic activity.	4
monocytogenes was inhibited at maximum concentrations maybe due @sm$ taxifolin @/sm$ contained in PBE. Furthermore, the growth of @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ was reduced 62%, at concentration of 1.25 mg/mL of PBE.	3
odontolyticus and @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$) and sub-gingival (S. gordonii, P. gingivalis and P. micra) communities, bacterial species were mixed in approximately equal amounts in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.15 M @sm$ NaCl @/sm$, 0.05 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4).	0
officinarum indicates that @sm$ p-octopamine @/sm$, essential oils, and phenylpropanoids are abundant in the rhizomes. These small molecular compounds display versatile biological activities. For instance, alleviated @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$-associated gastritis inhibited the growth of common pathogenic bacteria; reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-8 in lipopolysaccharide-treated murine macrophage J774A1; and regulated the levels of superoxide dismutase and malonaldehyde.	3
oral taxon 181 and different @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ species), suggesting that pH neutralization also occurred via other pathways for these bacteria, or that they relied on other community members for the metabolic precursors required in the initial steps in the pathway. Streptococci and @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ shared some of the 12 expressed genes that encode ammonia-producing enzymes but they also expressed unique enzymes (e.g. serine deaminase in S. parasangunis, agmatine deiminase in streptococci genomes, adenine deaminase in @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ genomes). Interestingly, the nucleoside cytidine deaminase, which catalyzes the formation of ammonia and @sm$ uridine @/sm$ was highly employed by 37 genomes representing five different genera (@gm$ Veillonella @/gm$, Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Actinomyces, and Solobacterium) (See Additional file 15: Table S13). Via deaminase enzyme activities, amino groups are removed from larger molecules and ammonia is formed as a byproduct. The alkaline ammonia from these activities may have an impact on the local pH, however this has not yet been experimentally verified. The upexpression of these enzymes in low pH may therefore not only result in a more alkaline micro-environment but also an increased activity of metabolic pathways associated with primary metabolism (e.g. biosynthesis of @sm$ uridine @/sm$ from cytidine via the enzymatic activity of the cytidine deaminase).	1
oralis, the authors of a randomized clinical trial in 2017 studied the antibacterial effect when exposed to other bacteria involved in the formation of plaque (@gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$, Actinomyces gerencseriae and Actinomyces oris). The authors studied the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on the microbiological state of tissues. As a result of surgical treatment of Severe Chronic Periodontitis using aPDT in one episode with a diode laser and a @sm$ phenothiazine @/sm$ photosensitizer, the study showed a reduction in inflammation.	3

Conclusion: These results suggested that KF can achieve positive effects on treating obesity, which manifest on reducing BMI, fat mass, blood @sm$ glucose @/sm$, and blood lipid, improving hepatic function, and also regulating intestinal microfloral structure.	2
ovis and @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ more resistant than B. suis to erythromycin, but Etest MIC values for B. ovis and @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ were less than those of the reference strains of B. suis. The MIC values for the marine isolates were low and more similar to those of B. suis than to those of either B. melitensis or B. abortus. The patterns of relative sensitivity to macrolides of the reference Brucella were similar for erythromycin, @sm$ clarithromycin @/sm$, and azithromycin but differed from that for clindamycin.	4
paludicola does not possess CODH/ACS, it metabolically loses a bypass between methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin (CH3-H4MPT) and acetyl-CoA and is not able both to assimilate CO2 as the sole @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source and to utilize acetate as the methanogenic source. It was pointed out as a notable growth characteristic that M. paludicola required acetate for the growth. The genome harbors the genes for acetyl-CoA metabolisms, e.g. AMP forming acetyl-CoA synthases (MCP_0419 and MCP_0935) and ADP forming acetyl-CoA synthetases (MCP_0448 to 0449, and MCP_2918). As predicted in @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ , acetate is likely assimilated into acetyl-CoA from which many cell compounds could be synthesized. Indeed, tracer experiments using the 13C-labeled acetate or bicarbonate showed that both acetate and bicarbonate were incorporated into the growing cells of M. paludicola, while acetate was more abundantly assimilated than bicarbonate (see Table S3 for the supporting information). These results indicate that M. paludicola require acetate as the primary @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source but also mixotrophically grows with acetate and CO2. The carbon dioxide serves not only as the absolute electron acceptor for methanogenesis (energy source) but also as the additional @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source.	2
parasanguinis, and @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ are also presented in Supplementary Tables S3-S5 and Figures S3-S5. Overall, the streptococcal isolates showed high or moderate percentages of resistance to erythromycin (68.7%), benzylpenicillin (63.7%), ampicillin (51.5%) and tetracycline (30.8%), and susceptibility rates between 83.9 and 99.8% to the rest of the antimicrobials tested. S. mitis/oralis demonstrated a noteworthy resistance against erythromycin (69.6%) and benzylpenicillin (56.7%), followed by ampicillin (42.8%) and tetracycline (30.7%). Most of the isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime (82.8%), ceftriaxone (84.2%), clindamycin (89.3%), levofloxacin (96.3%), and @sm$ linezolid @/sm$ (99.5%). No vancomycin-resistant strains were identified. In comparison to S. mitis/oralis isolates, S. parasanguinis ones exhibited a higher percentage of resistance to erythromycin (80.8%), benzylpenicillin (80.5%), ampicillin (72%), and tetracycline (51.2%) and a slightly lower susceptibility to cefotaxime (79.3%), ceftriaxone (81.7%), clindamycin (82.9%), and levofloxacin (85.4%). No strains resistant to @sm$ linezolid @/sm$ or vancomycin were found. @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ also displayed remarkable resistance to benzylpenicillin (76.4%), erythromycin (70.4%), ampicillin (60.9%), and a noticeable sensitivity (77.8-100%) to the rest of antibiotics assayed. Regarding S. vestibularis, 41.4% of isolates were erythromycin-resistant; however, the susceptibility to the rest of antimicrobials tested was high (72.4-100%). In fact, no strains resistant to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or @sm$ linezolid @/sm$ appeared among the isolates of this species.	3
paratyphi A, and @gm$ S. paratyphi B @/gm$ (GenBank: NC_004631, NC_006511, NC_010102). beta-lactamase genes were detected by PCR with primers specific for blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA among isolates resistant to @sm$ ampicillin @/sm$ as described previously, and PCR products were sequenced as described above.	4
paratyphi B, @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$, S. enteriditis, and S. choleraesuis could be distinguished by the red/green ratios obtained. Combining upconversion nanocrystals codoped with Li+ and K+ increases the signal intensities by 7-10 times and can simultaneously perform a dual-target assay for Y. pestis and B. pseudomallei. Another aspect is that the doping of UCNPs with different materials has changed the luminescence property; in this study, Mn2+, when doped to UCNPs (NaYF4:@sm$ Yb @/sm$, Tm), produced an intense peak at 807 nm.	0
perfringens and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$), and the enteropathogenic C. difficile . On the other hand, some Clostridium species are of great industrial importance. For example, C. thermocellum can produce ethanol from lignocellulosic waste at high temperature, while C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii produce solvents (acetone, butanol, and ethanol) by utilizing a variety of substrates from monosaccharides to @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$.	2
phytofermentans strain ISDg (@gm$ ATCC 700394 @/gm$) was cultured in a defined medium, MQM5 1, prepared as follows: 2 0 g L-1 NaH2PO4, 10 0 g L-1 @sm$ K2HPO4 @/sm$, 1 0 g L-1 (NH4)2SO4, 1 0 g L-1 l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, 20 mL L-1 XT solution (5 0 g L-1 xanthine and 5 0 g L-1 thymine in 0 06 m NaOH), 10 mL L-1 AA1 solution (5 0 g L-1 of each of the following amino acids: alanine, arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methinonine, proline and valine), and 10 mL L-1 trace element solution, resazurin (1 mg L-1), which was added as an oxidation/reduction indicator. After autoclaving, 10 mL L-1 CPV3 solution (20 mg L-1 p-aminobenzoic acid, 1 mg L-1 biotin, 30 mg L-1 folinic acid, 80 mg L-1 nicotinamide, 5 mg L-1 pantethine, 2 mg L-1 pyridoxal hydrochloride, 30 mg L-1 riboflavin and 10 mg L-1 thiamine) was added. The @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ inoculum was initially grown in MQM5 1 with 3 g L-1 cellobiose as a carbon source using the anaerobic techniques described by.	2
piger, methane production by @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and acetate production by B. hydrogenotrophica were inhibited in the late phase of incubations. We speculated this could be caused by the increased sulfide concentration produced by D. piger during incubations as @sm$ hydrogen sulfide @/sm$ is highly reactive and toxic to microbes. To confirm the effect of sulfide on the growth of the hydrogenotrophic species, monocultures of the three species were performed with different sulfide concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mM (Experiment two, Figure 2a). We observed that the growth of D. piger and B. hydrogenotrophica was not impacted by sulfide concentrations. Interestingly, low concentration sulfide (1 mM) had no effect on the growth of @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$, whereas 3 mM, 6 mM and 10 mM sulfide inhibited the @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ growth. These findings suggest that produced sulfide in the DM and BDM cocultures over time inhibited the growth of @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ (Figure 2b).	3

pneumonia, and @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$, have been prevented and eliminated using the natural imidazole derivative 2-aminoimidazole. By their impact on bacterial cell signaling and gene expression, indole derivatives have also been demonstrated to be effective against biofilms. Plant extracts such as garlic, @sm$ hordenine @/sm$, limonoids, and quercetin are a few examples of natural products that have shown efficiency against biofilms by preventing the transcription of specific genes necessary for QS.	3
pneumoniae isolates had high MIC to @sm$ ceftriaxone @/sm$; therefore, they were considered as potential ESBL producers according to the CLSI guidelines. Table 3 shows resistance profiles for MDR Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli (27/70, 38.6%), K. pneumoniae (24/70, 34.3%), E. cloacae (4/70, 5.7%), K. oxytoca (2/70, 2.8%), and @gm$ K. ornithinolytica @/gm$ (2/70, 2.8%). Table 4 shows resistance profiles for non-fermenter MDR GNB isolates including A. baumannii (9/70, 12.8%) and P. aeruginosa (2/70, 2.8%). The MIC50 (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited) values of MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae are shown in Table 5. Overall, the MIC50 of @sm$ ceftriaxone @/sm$, cefepime, cephradine, or ampicillin was >512 mug/mL.	4

pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis are all species of alpha-haemolytic streptococci (alpha-HS) that are both commensal and pathogenic in people; Streptococcus viridans are a group of streptococcal organisms including Streptococcus mitis, @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$, and S. mutans. S. viridians have been shown to be involved in causing empyema thoracis and lung abscesses. S. aureus is a commensally carried Gram-positive bacterium that can act as an opportunistic respiratory pathogen in susceptible individuals. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is positively associated with noninvasive and invasive infections, compared to those who do not carry S. aureus. It is important to assess the carriage of S. aureus and to monitor if carriage of @sm$ methicillin @/sm$-resistant (MRSA) bacteria is increasing in the community.	4
pneumoniae, and @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$) recovered in medium containing lignin as the unique carbon source from the same samples suggests that they can convert lignin in a more efficient way than that of other members of the community. In addition to the phenotypic tests, we obtained the three ligninolytic Klebsiella draft genomes, selected due to fast growth in the presence of lignin and dyes as the sole carbon source. Here, we firstly demonstrated the ligninolytic ability of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1 based on phenotypic assays. Initial evidence emerges from it isolating in the presence of lignin as the sole carbon source in cultivated media. However, even well established in identifying ligninolytic strains, there is a criticism about this isolating methods. Most commercial or kraft lignin could present residual organic acids or @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ in your formulation, and it may lead to false negative ligninolytic strains isolation. Thus, we performed a semi-quantitative approach to demonstrate the conversion of nonsoluble lignin by @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1. Our results demonstrate a significant fraction of residual nonsoluble lignin was consumed along the bacteria growth. It suggests the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1 convert a fraction of nonsoluble lignin in biomass and promote the release of lignin fragments to the soluble fraction. Interestingly, the ability to grow in the presence of dyes which mimetic lignin fragments reinforce the possibility of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1 to use a part of the solubilized fragments towards biomass formation. Although strong evidence has been found through the presented phenotypic analyzes based on the growth of the @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1 strain in the presence of kraft lignin, we have performed genomic analyzes aiming to identify the potential genetic repertoire capable of promoting the ability of the strain to convert lignin and its fragments.	2
prausnitzii and @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ were confirmed to participate in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) biosynthesis. B. adolescentis could secrete small molecule anti-inflammatory substances and inhibit inflammation. Eubacterium rectale could degrade @sm$ starch @/sm$ in the human intestine and competitively inhibited the growth of harmful bacteria.	2
pseudocatenulatum, and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$, accounting for <10% of the adult human microbiome, but they are linked to host health. Certain species of Bifidobacterium can generate phenolic acids by expressing feruloyl esterase. For example, the feruloyl esterase of B. animalis can hydrolyze chlorogenic acid (CHA) into caffeic acid (CAA). CAA (10-30 mg/kg) can prevent acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice by increasing Nrf2 transcription. The participation of partial Bifidobacterium promotes the metabolism of @sm$ flavanones @/sm$, glycosides, and saponins in the gut.	1
pseudocatenulatum, while in the case of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ and B. animalis subsp. animalis deconjugation activity was relatively low but still detectable. Additionally, BSH enzymes exhibited a preference for glycine-conjugated bile salt (GDCA) over taurine-conjugated form (TDCA), in all tested microorganisms. It was particularly evident in the case of B. animalis subsp. animalis and B. animalis subsp. lactis, which showed about three-fold higher BSH activity with glycodeoxycholic acid compared to @sm$ taurodeoxycholic acid @/sm$.	2
pseudolongum, and 73 @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ strains, including five reference strains, to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, linezolid, neomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and @sm$ trimethoprim @/sm$ is summarized in Table 1. MICs (mug/mL) are reported in terms of the MIC range, MIC50 (MIC that inhibited 50% of the tested strains), and MIC90 (MIC that inhibited 90% of the tested strains). Accordingly, no marked difference in the MIC distributions between the different species was observed for chloramphenicol, kanamycin, linezolid, neomycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. For these antimicrobial agents narrow unimodal MIC distributions either at the low-end concentration range (i.e., for chloramphenicol, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin) or at the high-end concentration range (i.e., for kanamycin and neomycin) were determined (Figures 1(a)-1(e)). A unimodal distribution describes a population, which is either uniformly susceptible (i.e., for chloramphenicol, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin) or resistant (i.e., for kanamycin and neomycin). Next to a unimodal distribution MIC values, obtained by susceptibility testing of a defined population of strains, can also follow a bimodal or multimodal distribution. For @sm$ trimethoprim @/sm$ a multimodal distribution with three different subpopulations was identified: one with very low MICs (<=0.12 mug/mL), another one with higher MICs (0.5-16 mug/mL), and a last one with high MICs (32->128 mug/mL) (Figure 1(f)). While B. animalis strains generally had lower @sm$ trimethoprim @/sm$ MICs (<=0.12 mug/mL), the highest MICs were detected for @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ strains (0.5->128 mug/mL).	3
pseudopneumoniae, and @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ type strains (harboring choline in their (lipo)teichoic acids), although to eradicate the cells down to the limit of detection it was necessary to add the enzyme at 5 mug/ml. As expected, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ SK598 strain, which possesses @sm$ ethanolamine @/sm$-containing teichoic acids, was refractory to PL3 bacteriolytic action.	4
pseudotuberculosis   and its near identical relative   @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$   form biofilms on biotic surfaces such as the cuticle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and in @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$, on the proventriculus and in the gut of the oriental rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis. Some   Y. pseudotuberculosis   strains can also form biofilms on abiotic surfaces. Using specific antibodies or the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), the major extracellular @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ present in   Yersinia   EPS has been shown to be poly-GlcNAc, the polymeric form of the amino sugar beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). This is synthesised and exported by components of the haemin storage loci (hmsHFRS, hmsCDE, hmsT, hmsP, hmsB). The role of the hms locus is well documented with mutations in the hmsHFRS genes resulting in reduced   Y. pseudotuberculosis   and   @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$   biofilm formation on the surface of C. elegans while flea proventricular and gut blockage are also attenuated in @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ hms mutants.	1
putA encodes proline dehydrogenase, which converts proline into @sm$ glutamate @/sm$:the major osmolyte required during hyperosmotic stress adaptation of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ (Lee et al., ). putA transcription showed a trend, albeit not quite reaching statistical significance, towards higher levels in the RifR9 strain than the wild type during exponential growth and in stationary phase (Figure 4). These results suggest that @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ expressing RpoBS522L is characterized by an increased basal level of stress gene transcription.	1
putida PCL 1445, isolated from a site polluted with @sm$ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @/sm$ and P. putida 267, isolated from the black pepper rhizosphere. More recently, putisolvins III, IV and V were described from cocoyam rhizosphere isolates Pseudomonas spp. COR19, COR55, NNC7, WCU_60, WCU_64 and in P. putida @gm$ LMG 11722 @/gm$T, the type strain of @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$.	2

The @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content of A. ihumii is comparable to that of A. shahii (57.90 and 57.60%, respectively), lower than those of A. timonensis and A. senegalensis (58.8 and 58.4%, respectively) and higher than those of A. putredinis, @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ and A. finegoldii (53.30, 54.80 and 56.60%, respectively). A. ihumii has a smaller gene content than those of A. putredinis, @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$, A. obesi, A. timonensis, A. shahii, A. senegalensis, and A. finegoldii (2,301, 2,335, 2,342, 2,619, 2,709, 3,132, 3,161, and 3,231, respectively). The ratio of genes per MB of A. ihumii is higher than those of A. timonensis, A. senegalensis, @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$, and A.	0

Preliminary studies on the effect of probiotics against H. pylori revealed that inhibition may be due to @sm$ lactic acids @/sm$ and bacteriocins.	1
pyogenes, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, S. anginosus, S. intermedius, S. constellatus, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was performed for antimicrobials, which included first and second line antibiotics for treating PTA: @sm$ penicillin @/sm$, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, clindamycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were assessed using the E-test method and the guideline 'Breakpoint tables for interpretation of MICs and zone diameters' from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (version 5.0, 2015; www.eucast.org). Exact MIC values, which were used to determine sensitivity for each specimen, were as follows: @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ - @sm$ penicillin @/sm$, ampicillin/sulbactam (MIC susceptible<=0.25; resistant>2); clindamycin (MIC susceptible<=0.5; resistant>0.5); S. milleri group (SMG) - @sm$ penicillin @/sm$, ampicillin/sulbactam (MIC susceptible<=0.25; resistant>2); clindamycin (MIC susceptible <= 0.5; resistant>0.5); S. pneumoniae - @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ (MIC susceptible<=0.06; resistant>2); ampicillin/sulbactam (MIC susceptible<=0.5; resistant>2); cefuroxime, erythromycin (MIC susceptible<=0.25; resistant>0.5); clindamycin (MIC susceptible<=0.5; resistant>0.5); ciprofloxacin (MIC susceptible<=0.125; resistant>2); S. pyogenes - @sm$ penicillin @/sm$, ampicillin/sulbactam (MIC susceptible<=0.25; resistant>0.25); clindamycin (MIC susceptible<=0.5; resistant>0.5); F. necrophorum - @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ (MIC susceptible<=0.25; resistant>0.5); ampicillin/sulbactam (MIC susceptible<=4; resistant>8); clindamycin (MIC susceptible<=4; resistant>4); metronidazole (MIC susceptible<=4; resistant>4).	3

reported that Trp metabolites, such as @sm$ kynurenine @/sm$, are able to downregulate CNS immune responses through activation of the AHR on glial cells. Dietary Trp is metabolized by members of the gut microbiota (e.g., Lactobacillaceae and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species) into AHR ligands, such as indole-3-aldehyde and indole-3-lactic acid, which have an effect on astrocytes, reducing CNS inflammation and disease scores in EAE. Given that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species were the predominant taxa in the marmoset fecal microbiota, there is the potential that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ mediated health benefits in the YBS-fed marmosets via Trp-derived metabolites.	1

The present study identified complement proteins C3 and C9 which were significantly upregulated against A. hydrophila infection. These results showed that complement cascade in C. Idella may be used to establish the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) after being treated with A. hydrophila. MAC is imperative outcome complex of innate immune system, which can form holes on the bacterial cell surface, which make a route for the entry of @sm$ calcium @/sm$ ions, modify the cell membrane permeability, and leads directly to cell dissolution.	3

ruminantium and @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ can utilize lactic acid to produce VFA, and thus LUB-based DFMs are expected to aid in preventing the accumulation of lactate in the rumen and maintaining a higher ruminal pH as well as increasing VFA production. @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ is one of the species to prevent ruminal acidosis in dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet, especially for the postpartum period. This species seems to be the major lactic acid utilizer in the rumen when animals are fed readily fermentable carbohydrates, since other lactate-fermenting bacteria (S. ruminantium) undergo catabolite repression. Furthermore, it has been reported that @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ utilizes lactate, glucose and @sm$ maltose @/sm$ thus would compete with LAB for substrate, leading to reducing the lactate concentration and in the meantime enhancing VFA production. It is also suggested that the efficacy of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ on prevention of SARA might depend on the dietary grain types and the endogenous rumen microbiota, and meanwhile, the supplementation of this bacterial species can alter the rumen microflora by decreasing S. bovis counts and increasing protozoa counts. However, the past research did not take the individualized rumen microbiome into account on how they respond to this DFM differently. Such limitations could be the barrier of applying @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ as DFMs in different production systems.	2
ruminis DSM 5522 encodes electron-bifurcating group A3 [FeFe]-hydrogenases predicted to use H2 to reduce CO2 to @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (Fig. 5A). The acsB gene is also encoded in some butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$), which produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$ through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and converts it to butyrate. In turn, in vitro experiment 2 where rice straw was the sole substrate indicated that inoculation of the fiber-rich selected microbiome resulted in lower CH4 and greater @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate production compared to the starch-rich selected microbiome (Fig. 5B, p < 0.05). This suggests the possibility that the fiber-rich diet may have selected for hydrogenotrophic acetogens, which may use some of the H2 that would otherwise be used for methanogenesis to produce @sm$ acetate @/sm$.	1
salivarius, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and S. mutans), all parts of the normal oral microbiota. This expands previous findings from a recent studies that reported that PPI use was associated with an increased abundance of several taxa common to the oral flora, such as Veillonella and several Streptococcus species. Interestingly, V. parvula is reported to have a mutualistic relationship with S. mutans by co-aggregating and transforming metabolic products of other @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-fermenting bacteria. With regards to the potential function of omeprazole-associated bacteria, we found that functional modules linked to degradation of fructose, ribose, lactate and trehalose were strongly enriched (all p-values <10-6) for bacterial species positively associated with omeprazole, pointing again to @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-fermentation. Although we only investigated omeprazole and no other types of PPI, earlier studies have demonstrated similar effects of different PPI types on the gut microbiota. Taken together, the current study provides strong support for the notion that PPI use is associated with consistent alteration of gut microbiota, characterized by the increased abundance of bacteria common in the oral flora with an enrichment for bacterial functions related to @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism.	2

show that the pH values of the broth cultures of five species of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ decreased from their initial value of 7.0 to a minimum of 4.87 in the medium using XOS and the organism @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ ssp. Lactis. Usta-Gorgun and Yilmaz-Ersan reported faster growth and lower pH values of media composed of 2% salep, considered a prebiotic. Therefore, it is assumed that in the control medium, the probiotic found a simple @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source that was metabolized faster than in the caja pulp. Still, the pulp of caja showed greater growth of @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ ssp. lactis, which indicates that the nutrients present in the fermentation medium were used for cell development. When fermentation substrates are consumed by animals and humans, acidity in the colon decreases depending on the structure and concentration of substrates such as prebiotics. Acidification during the fermentation process results in a reduction in the growth of pathogenic bacteria and an increase in beneficial macrobiotics, composed, for example, of cultures of the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus genera.	2

Many studies have shown that the beneficial effects of prebiotics are mediated by SCFAs. Depending on the individual microbiota that is present, prebiotics may produce butyrate or propionate. Although butyrate has greater anti-inflammatory effects, propionate has also been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects.

sirindhornae, on the cariogenic bacterium @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$. MATERIALS AND METHODS: @sm$ Dichloromethane @/sm$ extracts (DME) of propolis (DMEP) were prepared and analysed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibacterial growth and antibiofilm formation effects of DMEP on @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ were compared with those of apigenin, a commercial propolis product. The effects of DMEP and apigenin on glucosyltransferase (gtf) B expression in @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Chlorhexidine (CHX) was used as a positive control in the experiments. RESULTS: Apigenin, pinocembrin, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid were not detected in the propolis extracts. DMEP and apigenin significantly inhibited @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ growth (IC50 = 43.5 and 17.36 mg/ml, respectively). DMEP and apigenin also exhibited antiadherence effects on @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ as shown by reduced biofilm formation. Furthermore, a significant inhibition in gtfB expression was observed in DMEP and apigenin treated @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$. CONCLUSION: Propolis produced by T. sirindhornae demonstrated antibacterial and antibiofilm effects, and reduced gtfB expression in @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$.	3
smithii and @gm$ Faecalitalea cylindroides @/gm$. Thus far, the family Erysipelotrichaceae and its member F. cylindroides have been associated with hypercholesterolaemia, although the metabolic pathways linking Erysipelotrichaceae with aberrant @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism have not been clearly indicated. A positive association with dyslipidaemia has been also reported for Escherichia-Shigella, which produces LPS inflammatory mediators. Eggerthella was observed to be more abundant among individuals with increased blood TG levels. At least some species from this genus have been reported as modifiers of the intestinal bile acid pool. The genus Bacteroides is diverse and comprises bacteria producing SCFAs that could potentially reduce serum cholesterol. The association patterns between Bacteroides and metabolic traits like obesity and hyperlipidaemia vary across different studies, probably due to the high diversity of the genus. Human gut methanogens, including M. smithii, have been found to be positively correlated with circulating cholesterol levels. The genus Veillonella has been found among taxa enriched in hypercholesterolaemia. The family Veillonelaceae comprises lactate-degrading bacteria that are related to physical performance rates in athletes. The species V. atypica improved performance rates by facilitating exercise-induced lactate conversion into propionate, which supports a potential role of Veillonella in @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism.	3

"smithii and @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ were recognized as residents of the human gut. They belong to the order Methanobacteriales, one of the six known orders of methanogens. However in 2008, the existence of a seventh order inhabiting the human gut (hereafter referred to as the Mx-lineage) was proposed, particularly common in older subjects, and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, the first and unique isolated member of this order metabolizes @sm$ methanol @/sm$ with hydrogen for methane production. Genomic sequences of three of these unusual methanogens are currently available, that of M. luminyensis, and genome sequences that we recently determined for ""Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus"" and ""Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis"" grown in an enrichment culture from human stool. ""Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus"" belongs to the RCC cluster that was recently highlighted for its putative involvement in TMA consumption in the rumen, while M. luminyensis and ""Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis"" are phylogenetically closely related to the RCC cluster. These three genomes have all of the genes necessary for reduction of @sm$ methanol @/sm$ using hydrogen, but also for the reduction of tri- di- and monomethylamine with hydrogen (Fig. 2), while the two other possible pathways for methanogenesis (CO2 reduction with H2 and acetoclastic methanogenesis) are genetically incomplete. Whereas the capacity of these strains to reduce @sm$ methanol @/sm$ with hydrogen was previously demonstrated, their ability to grow on TMA with hydrogen has not been investigated."	2
smithii compared to @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ can be explained by the fact that the genome of the former is more tailored to the gut environment with regards to metabolic versatility, genomic evolution ability, and persistence. In the gut, M. smithii converts @sm$ H2 @/sm$, CO2, and formate into CH4 using carbon as the terminal electron acceptor; this redox reaction sustains anaerobic respiration, which allows for the production of ATP. This archaeon can also remove fermentation end products, such as methanol and ethanol, produced by other bacteria lacking a methanogenic pathway, while @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ energy metabolism is limited to using @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ to reduce methanol to methane and is dependent on acetate as a carbon source. Methanogenesis is of paramount importance in preventing the accumulation of gases and other reaction end products. Accordingly, a metagenomic analysis of the gut flora in three healthy individuals found that M. smithii comprised up to 11.5% of the gut microorganisms. However, 16S rRNA- and mcrA gene-based studies detected M. smithii with variable prevalence in less than half of the tested individuals and no @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$; such results cannot reflect the actual quantity of these two Archaea in the human gut because of their specific association with the gut mucosa. We hypothesized that the variable prevalence of M. smithii DNA in human stool specimens and the failure to detect @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ DNA in various studies may be due to limitations in the experimental protocols and to the relatively small samples comprising three or six individuals. We aimed to establish an optimized protocol for the extraction and detection of archaeal DNA by exploiting the M. smithii and @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ genome sequences.	1
smithii, @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, M. arboriphilicus, M. stadtmanae, M. luminyensis, M. beijingense and M. concilii incubated without biocide grew as expected with a methane production starting at day 3.

Specific requirements for purines and/or pyrimidines were detected, and these requirements could be used to distinguish Haemophilus-Actinobacillus group organisms. Some strains of P. gingivalis grew without @sm$ vitamin K @/sm$, while others were not satisfied by menadione but required its precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid.	3
soil, fresh/sewage water, and solid waste, various strains of the genus @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ have attracted a surge interest from a medical, environmental and biotechnological point of view.

Some strains of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ are known to be associate in biodegradation of different number of pollutants such as Permethrin (Zhan et al.), phenanthrene, 3-chloroaniline (Duc), diesel (Ho et al.), indole (Sadauskas et al.), malathion (Xie et al.), deltamethrin (Tang et al.), azo dye (Sreedharan et al.) and phenol (Liu et al.). Biodegradation of cellulose, chitin, @sm$ pectin @/sm$, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene by Actinetobacter from deep Sea Sediments were reported by (Chen et al.). Bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons by @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ were described in (Cai et al.). In addition, some of the @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ strains are also recognized to produce important by-products. There are countless applications of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ strains in the treatment of dangerous waste or as generators of economically beneficial bio-products.	2

"stadtmanae (23%), Candidatus ""Methanomethylophilus alvus"" and Candidatus ""@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$,"" among others. As polysaccharides get fermented by gut bacteria, gasses such as @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ (@sm$ H2 @/sm$) and methane (CH4) are generated as by-products. In addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate and butyrate are also produced by the colonic bacteria whereby these SCFAs and gasses could affect bowel movement as well as gut permeability. One study by found a lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in IBS patients, particularly in IBS-D and IBS-M. As butyrate-producing bacteria are known to improve intestinal barrier function, decreased amount of these bacteria in IBS-D and IBS-M patients could have led to impairment in intestinal permeability and activate the nociceptive sensory pathways, which manifest in the symptoms observed. They also found that IBS patients not undergoing any therapy had lower abundance of Methanobacteria. This observation was in agreement with several other studies which found that methane production was seen at lower levels in IBS-D and higher levels in IBS-C. Besides the sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens from the Archaea kingdom are the main gut microbe responsible for removing excess @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ by converting it to methane. Methane production capacity is linked to low transit time and anti-inflammatory effects in the colon. In IBS patients, lower counts of methanogens imply reduced ability for @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ gas removal from the colon, and hence this could attribute to flatulence or excess gas in the abdomen."	2

suggested that circulating serotonin was not correlated with NEFA and @sm$ BHBA @/sm$ levels in ketotic dairy cows, which is consistent with the results of the present study. Furthermore, microbial Trp catabolites participate in inflammatory regulation and the development of metabolic disease. For example, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ in the intestine convert Trp into ILA and IAA.	1

While the redirection of carbon and electron flux through this pathway likely has little effect on product yields, synthesis of GTP, versus ATP, may promote transcription and protein synthesis. Finally, Cal. subterraneus, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$, P. furiosus, Th. kodakaraensis, Ta. pseudethanolicus, and Thermotoga species do not encode all of the proteins required for a ""malate shunt"" and consequentially the catalysis of @sm$ PEP @/sm$ to pyruvate must be achieved via PPK and/or PPDK."	2
thetaiotaomicron and @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$. The former gut symbiont has a wide capacity to degrade complex polysaccharides but is unable to degrade the flavonoid quercetin, while the latter is a quercetin-degrading species with limited capacity to breakdown polysaccharides. Indeed, @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ has been shown to respond to the presence of quercetin in the human diet. In this model, the addition of starch increased @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ quercetin degradation activity and the ensuing production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, whereas high levels of butyrate were significantly induced when co-culturing with B. thetaiotaomicron. In contrast, when both species were cultured individually in starch and quercetin enriched media, no significant quercetin degradation nor butyrate production were observed. Hence, the release of glucose and @sm$ maltose @/sm$ upon the starch fermentation by B. thetaiotaomicrom powered, in turn, the quercetin-degrading activity of @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$.	2
timonensis, BVAB2, and @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ were associated with elevated vaginal pH, in addition to the core group bacteria. Srinivasan and colleagues' prior analysis of the Seattle data also reported that P. bivia was associated with elevated vaginal pH. Metabolomic and genomic evidence again suggests biogenic amines may underlie these associations. One metabolomics study observed that @sm$ cadaverine @/sm$ and tyramine, both amines, and N-acetylputrescine, a degradation product of the amine putrescine, were associated with elevated vaginal pH. These amines were highly correlated with BVAB2 and P. timonensis, and @sm$ cadaverine @/sm$ and N-acetylputrescine with @gm$ P. micra @/gm$.	1

uenonis, and @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ were the drivers of 57 pathways and showed a significant difference in abundance (P < 0.05) between C. trachomatis-positive and -negative endocervical samples (Table S5). The predicted pathways characterizing C. trachomatis-positive endocervical samples were involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, CoA, dTDP-l-rhamnose, l-lysine, UMP, CDP-diacylglycerol, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, guanosine ribonucleotides, and @sm$ NAD @/sm$.	1
uncover that increasing the amount of dietary iron exacerbates both clinical and histological severity of @sm$ DSS @/sm$-induced colitis in mice; in particular, doubling the amount of dietary iron significantly aggravates intestinal inflammation, while also altering the gut microbiota via diminishing the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and promoting opportunistic pathogens, like Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (Figure 2). Likewise, it has been clinically reported that oral iron administration perturbs the gut microbiota, including dimishing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii abundance (Figure 2). This is detrimental since Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most abundant bacteria in the healthy human microbiota and a candidate for next generation probiotics due to its anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing capabilities. Similarly, Ruminococcus bromii can degrade resistant starch particles, where fermentation of starches generates SCFAs, including the 'beneficial' butyrate; therefore, reduction of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii explains, in part, why IBD patients have significantly attenuated butyrate levels. This has introduced supplementing butyrate-producing bacteria as a therapeutic for IBD cases, and there have been promising results of improved intestinal mucosal integrity; yet, Zhang et al. document that introducing butyrate-producing bacterium (i.e. @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$) actually accelerates gut dysbiosis and aggravates colitis in @sm$ DSS @/sm$-treated mice. In particular, it was demonstrated that administrating @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ does not result in butyrate elevation in colitic mice; therefore, one could argue that reducing butyrate levels could be an adaptive mechanism during colitis pathogenesis.	3
used urea to formulate different levels of CP in the diets of Hu sheep and showed the genera, Prevotella and @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, to be enriched, whereas Ruminococcus and Butyrivibrio were enriched in the no-urea group, which were consistent with our findings. The predominant genus, Prevotella in the rumen utilizes a wide range of substrates, such as starch, hemicellulose, proteins, @sm$ peptides @/sm$, and amino acids. Notably, Prevotella is an important microbial member involved in the degradation of @sm$ peptides @/sm$ into amino acids, which is regarded as the limiting process in proteolysis and maybe attributed to increased CP digestibility in our study.	2

variabile as the most abundant species, followed by Ruminococcus bromii, @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$, and Dorea formicigenerans. The remaining PGs were mainly associated with Bacteroides and Collinsella at the genus level (File S1). The principal functional trends were very similar to those observed comparing CTRLs with T1Ds, showing the main differences in the higher variability of taxa associated with up-regulated PGs, and in an apparent more balanced regulation of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolism (Figure 2C).	0

In all laboratories the same method was used and a joint quality control carried out. The most active substances were metronidazole and clindamycin (MIC50 1.0 and 0.5 respectively; MIC90 4 mg/l for both). Tetracycline showed only little activity, whereas @sm$ doxycycline @/sm$ inhibited a major portion of the strains at therapeutically relevant concentrations (MIC50 16 and 2 mg/l, MIC90 32 and 16 mg/l, respectively).	3
vulnificus on the basis of the sugar composition of the @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ portion of their lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A previously developed rapid method of preparing samples for compositional sugar analysis was employed. Nineteen O-serogroups of V. fluvialis were divided into 14 chemotypes while seven O-serogroups of V. vulnifucus were divided also into seven chemotypes since the @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ portion of LPS of each serogroup has a different sugar composition from that of the other serogroups. Close similarities in the sugar composition of the same portion were demonstrated between serologically cross-reacting non-O1 group V. cholerae and V. fluvialis, and non-O1 V. cholerae and @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$.	1
vulnificus, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, V. harveyi, and V. cholerae) was in the order 17%, 13.3%, 4.4%, 2.2%, and 2.2% respectively. Antibiotic resistance by all Vibrio species was mostly observed against doxycycline (71-89%), erythromycin (86-100%), tetracycline (71-89%), @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ (86-100%), and sulfamethoxazole (87-100%), though susceptibility to meropenem (86-100%), cephalothin (60-100%), norfloxacin (93-100%), ciprofloxacin (88-100%), amikacin (64-100%), gentamicin (57-74%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57-81%) was equally observed in all species. @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ expressed highest resistance against streptomycin and chloramphenicol (64%), while V. vulnificus (52%) and V. cholerae (57%) had the highest resistance against cephalothin. High resistance against ampicillin (57%) and amoxicillin (50%) was exhibited by V. cholerae and @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ respectively.	4
vulnificus, and phlA in @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, are implicated in virulence but have only been shown to possess the lipase activity. Recombinant VvhA from Vibrio vulnificus was shown to induce NF-kappaB-dependent mitochondrial cell death mediated by the production of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ raft-dependent ROS.	1
wadsworthia and @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ log2(abundance) (Extended Data Fig. 8i), and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) was negatively correlated with @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ log2(abundance) (Extended Data Fig. 8j), suggesting that these species interact with various taurine-conjugated bile acids. We focused mainly on B. wadsworthia because it was differentially abundant in intestinal samples compared with stool (Fig. 1f). The name of the Bilophila genus reflects its growth stimulation by high concentrations of bile, and the higher ratio of GCA to @sm$ TCA @/sm$ concentration in participants who consumed dairy is potentially due to the ability of B. wadsworthia to deconjugate @sm$ TCA @/sm$ to use taurine for growth. Notably, in stool, the relative abundance of B. wadsworthia and @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ was correlated only weakly or not at all with @sm$ TCA @/sm$ concentration (Fig.	2

The patient was treated with high-dose @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ for 4 weeks and made a complete recovery.	3
were able to expand the spectrum of bacterial species grown with antioxidants by culturing aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria on a single medium by a simple addition of antioxidant consisting of 0.1 g glutathione +1 g @sm$ uric acid @/sm$ +1 g ascorbic acid to Shedler agar medium. This technical feat enabled the culture of 251 different bacterial species and showed that it was possible to perform antibiograms of anaerobic bacteria in aerobic conditions without affecting the sensitivity of the results. This technique was then applied to methanogenic archaea culture to successfully isolate 13 strains of @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ and nine strains of Methanobrevibacter oralis from 100 stools and 45 oral samples.	3

It is interesting to directly compare B. fragilis and B. vulgatus/B. dorei, which are two groups with deep strain representation (Fig. 2). Despite being phylogenetically more distant, members of these two species possess similar abilities to degrade starch and related molecules (@sm$ glycogen @/sm$ and pullulan), inulin, and mucin O-glycans.	2
