"""Hull"") rich in @sm$ PACs @/sm$ can reduce the metabolic activity of various common oral bacteria. It was the most effective against P. gingivalis, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. and S. mutans, in the concentration range from 350 to 1400 mug/mL. The antimicrobial activity of a lingonberry or a mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) was evaluated against two oral pathogens, S. mutans and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. Lingonberry juice concentrate was prefractionated over reversed-phased resin into fractions enriched with polyphenols. The anthocyanin and procyanidin primary fractions were the most efficient against @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ (MICs from 63 to 125 mug/mL), and the procyanidin-rich fraction against S. mutans (16-31 mug/mL). Duarte et al. (2006) also studied the effect of phenolics isolated from cranberries on the virulence traits of S. mutans. Flavonols (125 microg/mL) and @sm$ PACs @/sm$ (500 microg/mL) alone or in combination, inhibited GTFs (30-60% inhibition) and F-ATPases activities and the acid production by S."	3
"""In atherosclerotic plaques phylum Proteobacteria (Chryseomonas and Helicobacter genera) and phylum Firmicutes (Anaeroglobus, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Lactobacillales, and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ genera) is found in abundance in gut cavity. Other bacterias like Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus spp, Lactobacillales, and Collinsella population is altered in the gut among cardiovascular patients"". In fact, Bacteroides, Clostridium and Lactobacillales are considered to be diagnostic markers in patients suffering from coronary artery disease. Usage of subsp. lactis LKM512 of Bifidobacterium animalis as probiotic has shown reduced @sm$ TMA @/sm$ levels and certain bacterial group such as (Clostridia, Clostridiales, and Lachnospiraceae) which produces @sm$ TMA @/sm$, thus reducing the risk of arteriosclerosis."	1
(2015) examined the consequences of the supplementation of quercetin and @sm$ trans-resveratrol @/sm$ on a high-fat sucrose diet (HFS)-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In this study, Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, namely those receiving an HFS diet enriched with or without quercetin (30 mg/kg BW/day), @sm$ trans-resveratrol @/sm$ (15 mg/kg BW/day), or a mixture of the two components (quercetin and @sm$ trans-resveratrol @/sm$) at the same dosages used in the other treatments. This study revealed that the administration of quercetin resulted in a significant effect on the composition of GM at various levels of taxonomy, reducing the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and suppressing the multiplication of gut microbes linked to diet-induced obesity, including @gm$ E. cylindroides @/gm$, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Bacillus. In summary, dysbiosis of gut microbiota induced by the HFS diet was effectively attenuated by the supplementation of quercetin. However, there was no significant influence on the GM composition by the supplementation of @sm$ trans-resveratrol @/sm$ alone or in combination with quercetin. Moreover, the individual effect of quercetin was reduced when combined with @sm$ trans-resveratrol @/sm$.	3

Our previous work demonstrated an increase in plasma bacterial modified bioactive compounds in Mediterranean diet-fed NHPs. Consumption of Mediterranean diet elevated p-cresol-glucuronide, 3-indoxyl sulfate, and indole-3-propionate (IPA). IPA is the deamination product of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ mediated by gut Clostridium and Lactobacillus species, which we observed elevated Lactobacillus sp.	2
(most similar to strain DJF_B143), RUG133 a strain of @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ and RUG664 a strain of Streptococcus equinus. Bacillus licheniformis encodes both hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzymes as well as serine proteases and other important enzymes. Kandleria vitulina, relatively recently renamed, is a little-studied organism, although the family Erysiopelotrichaceae (of which it is a member) has been positively correlated with milk yield and negatively correlated with @sm$ methane @/sm$ emissions. Acidaminococcus fermentans is a Gram-negative diplococcus that uses citrate as an energy source, producing hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide, which may explain its association with @sm$ methane @/sm$ production in cattle (methanogens convert H2 with CO2 to CH4). Acidaminococcus fermentans has also been shown to decrease the accumulation of tricarballylate, a toxic end product of ruminal fermentation, by oxidizing trans-aconitate. Megasphaera spp. have been found in cattle, sheep and other ruminants. Megasphaera elsdenii's ability to produce a variety of VFAs is of interest to the chemical industry. Supplementation of the diet of dairy cows with M. elsdenii, which utilizes lactate as an energy source, has potential benefits for energy balance and animal productivity. @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ was first isolated from the rumen in 1991, has been shown to ferment starch with the production of acetic and lactic acid and has been implicated in acidosis.	0
42% PHBHHx consisting of 14% HHx was obtained with 5 g/L @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and 10 g/L lauric acid as co-substrate. Higher @sm$ glucose @/sm$ concentration greatly reduced the cell concentration and PHA content. The PHA biosynthesis genes from A. hydrophila WQ was successfully cloned using a two-step PCR cloning strategy based on PHA biosynthesis genes organization of @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$. A. hydrophila WQ and @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ shared high identities in the PHA gene loci, namely, ORF1, phaC and phaJ had 100%, 97% and 97.5% identities respectively. PHA synthases of @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ and A.	2
4B), indicating that @sm$ proline @/sm$ fermentation is not a dominant form of metabolism in this medium for C. difficile. Conversely, P. bifermentans, P. benzoelyticum, Paeniclostridium spp., and C. scindens produced substantial 5-aminovalerate. Similar to C. difficile, @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ did not produce high concentrations of 5-aminovalerate despite fermenting @sm$ proline @/sm$ in BHIS broth (Fig. 4A). In EG broth, C. saccharolyticum also did not produce 5-aminovalerate. Together these data reveal that members of the experimental Clostridia panel have varying capacities to ferment @sm$ proline @/sm$ that change depending on the nutrients available in the medium.	2

@gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ ST92 strains (MS1968 and MS1984) are MDR outbreak strains isolated from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Australia. Bacteria were grown in minimal medium supplemented with casamino acids (M9CA) composed of: 0.60% Na2HPO4, 0.30% KH2PO4, 0.30% casamino acids, 0.20% glucose, 0.20% thiamine, 0.10% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, 1 mM @sm$ MgSO4 @/sm$ and 0.1 mM CaCl2.	3
@gm$ A. fermentans @/gm$ thrives mainly by glutamate fermentation via the 2-hydroxyglutarate pathway in the intestinal tract of homeothermic animals, utilizing glutamate, citrate, and trans-aconitate as sole energy sources, in the presence of sodium. Ammonia, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate, and hydrogen are the main end products of growth. Transport and catabolism of these substrates are dependent on a sodium motive force as a method of membrane energetics. The fermentation of trans-aconitate in strain VR4T takes a different pathway, which is via citrate, oxaloacetate, and pyruvate, producing CO2, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, butyrate and hydrogen.	1
@gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ is a most common pathogenic gram-negative bacterium that can grow aerobically and anaerobically causing various infections in fresh fish populations. It has been reported to be a predominant aquatic pathogen that causes septicemia and furuculosis in freshwater fishes and is responsible for gastrointestinal system infections in humans. Recently, it has been reported that @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ develops resistance to several antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, rifampicin, tetracycline, @sm$ novobiocin @/sm$, etc. Therefore, due to the advancement of nanotechnology in the field of aquaculture, an efficient novel material has to be developed as an alternative to antibiotics against @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ which could be economically feasible for therapeutic applications. Among all the nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have gained much attention in the aquaculture field to control various forms of bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases especially to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. It has been previously reported that the AgNPs showed bactericidal activity against Aeromonas species, and Vibrio harveyi in various aquatic animals. Previously, it was reported that fish's innate immune system and antioxidant enzyme activity could enhance the defensive mechanism against @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ infection.	4
@gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ was diluted at 1: 100 in an appropriate dose of antibiotics with serials of concentrations of a total 32 exogenous metabolites including malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, serine, methionine, @sm$ oxaloacetic acid @/sm$, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, arginine, lysine, tyrosine, and glutamine ect.	2
@gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ (type strain YIT 12060T; DSM 22520T; JCM 16068T) was the next species to be discovered. It was isolated from human feces. This species is slightly different, since its shape is more coccoid than rod-shaped, as well as its inability to hydrolyze tryptophan to @sm$ indole @/sm$.	4
@gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ was cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) agar medium supplemented with 10% horse blood, TYG (tryptone-yeast extract-glucose) broth or minimal medium (MM) at 37  C in an anaerobic chamber from Coy Laboratories. Tyrosine was supplied as a substrate during investigation of 4EP production. L. plantarum was cultured anaerobically in MRS media (BD) at 37 C. Escherichia coli strains were cultured aerobically in LB broth. When appropriate, the growth medium was supplemented with 100 microg/ml @sm$ carbenicillin @/sm$, 25 microg/ml erythromycin, 2 microg/ml tetracycline, 200 microg/ml gentamicin and 200microg/ml 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR).	4
@gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ flavoproteins use up to 26 Pfam clans and 73 domain families (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 1, and Fig. SP1), and in 80% of the cases they fold using more than one domain. Nonetheless, only 13 clans, plus six domains not assigned to any clan, are implicated in flavin binding (Fig. SP1), in agreement with the diversity in structural topologies for the interaction of these cofactors. The NADP_Rossmann and TIM-barrel clans are the most widely represented and preferred respectively for FAD and FMN binding in @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ flavoproteins, being highly spread in proteins and particularly within flavoproteins. The NADP_Rossmann fold appears in 38 flavoproteins in @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, but presumably it is not involved in flavin binding in domains FAD_oxidored of sarcosine oxidase alpha subunit and DFP of coenzyme A biosynthesis bifunctional protein, where it respectively binds @sm$ NADH @/sm$ and CTP.	2
@gm$ B.melitensis @/gm$ was the most common isolated specie (18.1%). Spinal cord compression was observed in 52.6% of patients. Triple-regimen (Doxycycline + Rifampicin + @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$ or gentamicin or cotrimoxazole) was used in more than half of patients (52.9%, n = 9) followed by double regimen (41.1%, n = 7) and monotherapy (5.8%, n = 1).The median duration of antimicrobial therapy against brucellosis was 2 months (range, 2-6 months).Complete recovery was achieved in all patients and mortality was not seen in any of the patients.	3
@gm$ Bacillus @/gm$, Staphylococcus) and in D. radiodurans, which lack GSH (Newton et al.; Perera, Newton and Pogliano). Some other bacteria produce the low-molecular-weight thiol mycothiol (MSH) instead of GSH or BSH (Rosario-Cruz and Boyd). The biosynthesis and roles of BSH have been studied in @gm$ Bacillus @/gm$ and Staphylococcus species. Similar to GSH, BSH protects against H2O2, @sm$ hypochlorite @/sm$ and thiol/disulphide stress.	4
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ possesses immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects; therefore, it is believed to be beneficial for colon health. In calorie-restricted mice, the decline in the relative abundance of age-related bacteria, such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Akkermansia, could be prevented. Remodeling of the gut microbiota during CR contributes to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and decreases fat gain and the formation of beige adipocytes, which in turn extends the life span. Similar to the effect of CR on glucose metabolism and insulin activity in rodents and primates, acarbose supplementation can improve age-related glucose and insulin disorders. The therapeutic effects of acarbose treatment are achieved by the selective inhibition of @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism for calorie compensation while allowing @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ consumption.	2
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. are renowned for their ability to utilize a diverse range of @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, which contribute to the functional integrity of the human gut. We focused on identifying the repertoire of @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-utilizing enzymes (CAZymes) within the B. pseudocatenulatum genome sequences to predict the @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolic capacity of each isolate.	2
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ ssp. are widely used as probiotic microorganisms. Bifidobacterium mongoliense strains showing in vitro resistance to gastric and pancreatic juices, and bile salts, and having ability to digest milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ and produce antivirulent metabolites, have been reported.	2
@gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ is a relatively @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ tolerant Bifidobacterium species that has been isolated from bovine rumen, sewage, and from piglet, calf and baby feces. Peptidoglycans from @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ strain P2-91 protect mice against Escherichia coli infections and improve cytotoxic activity of mice lymphocytes. Furthermore, chicken were more resistant to E. coli infection after oral administration of @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$. The infant feces isolate B. thermophilum RBL67 (RBL67) is a promising probiotic candidate which genome was sequenced. The strain can grow under low @sm$ oxygen @/sm$, at pHs as low as 4.0 and at temperatures up to 47  C.	3
@gm$ Blautia @/gm$ spp. tends to ferment rhamnose to 1,2-propanediol. Different @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ spp. were increased in all three female treatment groups, suggesting increase rhamnose precursor stimulates growth of this bacteria that acts then upon this @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$. GEN and LD BPA groups were the two groups where behavioral differences were observed relative to AIN controls. Interestingly, the greatest number of metabolite changes were found in these same groups, especially females exposed to GEN or LD BPA. In all three female groups, various sugars were increased with GEN and LD BPA having the greatest number of such metabolite changes that also closely mirrored each other. Enrichment analyses also revealed that synthesis and metabolism of various @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, such as galactose metabolism, lactose degradation, and lactose synthesis, were among the top pathways in all three treatment groups. Capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) metabolomics analysis of urine from rats treated with BPA revealed amino acids, polyamines, nucleosides, organic acids, @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, pterins, polyphenols, and sugar phosphates were found as the most significantly differential metabolites.	2
@gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$, B. suis, B. melitensis, and B. canis were able to infect the SaOS-2 and MG-63 osteoblastic cell lines, and the first three species exhibited intracellular replication. @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ internalization was not significantly affected by pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D but was inhibited up to 92% by @sm$ colchicine @/sm$. A virB10 mutant of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ could infect but not replicate within osteoblasts, suggesting a role for the type IV secretion system in intracellular survival.	3
@gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$ is an ovine intracellular pathogen with tropism for the male genital tract. To establish and maintain infection, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ must survive stressful conditions inside host cells, including low pH, nutrient limitation, and reactive oxygen species. The same conditions are often encountered in axenic cultures during stationary phase. Studies of stationary phase may thus inform our understanding of Brucella infection biology, yet the genes and pathways that are important in Brucella stationary-phase physiology remain poorly defined. We measured fitness of a barcoded pool of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ Tn-himar mutants as a function of growth phase and identified cysE as a determinant of fitness in stationary phase. CysE catalyzes the first step in cysteine biosynthesis from serine, and we provide genetic evidence that two related enzymes, CysK1 and CysK2, function redundantly to catalyze cysteine synthesis at steps downstream of CysE. Deleting cysE (DeltacysE) or both cysK1 and cysK2 (DeltacysK1 DeltacysK2) results in premature entry into stationary phase, reduced culture yield, and sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These phenotypes can be chemically complemented by cysteine or @sm$ glutathione @/sm$. DeltacysE and DeltacysK1 DeltacysK2 strains have no defect in host cell entry in vitro but have significantly diminished intracellular fitness between 2 and 24 h postinfection. Our study has uncovered unexpected redundancy at the CysK step of cysteine biosynthesis in @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and demonstrates that cysteine anabolism is a determinant of peroxide stress survival and fitness in the intracellular niche.	2
@gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ KCTC 3314 and KCTC3320 strains were purchased from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (Jeongeup, Korea) and used for antimicrobial activity tests as human skin acne-causing bacteria. The solvents of Ethyl alcohol (95%), Methylene chloride, Ethyl acetate, n-Hexane, @sm$ Methyl alcohol @/sm$ (99%), and Trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) were purchased from Samchun Chemical Co., Ltd.	0
@gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$, B. wexlerae, and A. communis required modified medium and conditions to measure carbohydrate consumption. B. wexlerae were grown overnight in trypticase soja (TS) medium, and growth curves were generated as described above. @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ were grown overnight in Gam media, and the growth was tested in MM supplemented with yeast extract (20 mg/mL), beef extract (10 mg/mL) and 0.1% of the appropriate carbohydrate. A. communis was grown for 72 h in Columbia media supplemented with 1.9 muM hematin, 6 microM hemin, 15 muM FeSO4 and 200 ng/ml-1 vitamin B12, K1, and K3. To measure the growth of A. communis over 96 h, we used the Columbia media described above but depleted @sm$ starch @/sm$ and glucose.	2
@gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is distinct from other well-studied solventogenic and cellulolytic species found within clostridial Clusters I (Clostridiaceae), III (Ruminococcaceae), and X (Thermoanaerobacteraceae) (Fig 1). A member of Cluster XIV (Lachnospiraceae), @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is closely related to human commensals that have been sequenced as part of the International Human Microbiome Consortium, and to bacteria isolated from rice paddy soils, earthworm intestines and other anaerobic, @sm$ carbon @/sm$ rich environments (Fig 1). As a genetically tractable member of this under-explored group, and the first with a publicly available genome sequence, @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is an important point of reference for comparative genomic analyses.	2
@gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ was grown to the completion of logarithmic growth during which time a CV peak was observed. At the time at which this peak occurred, 10 mL of culture was anaerobically collected using a sterile needle and syringe and injected into a 30 mL sterile syringe and passed through a 0.22 microm filter into a sterile Balch tube filled with @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ gas. CV was conducted on the cell free medium with a 20 mL sterile Balch tube purged with 101 kPa anaerobic @sm$ N2 @/sm$.	0
@gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$ was isolated from forest soil and is distinguished by its capacity to directly ferment plant cell wall polysaccharides into @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ as the primary product, suggesting that it possesses unusual catabolic pathways. The objective of the present study was to understand the molecular mechanisms of biomass conversion to @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ in a single organism, @gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$, by analyzing its complete genome and transcriptome during growth on plant carbohydrates. The saccharolytic versatility of @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ is reflected in a diversity of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette sugar transporters and glycoside hydrolases, many of which may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes are frequently organized as operons that may be controlled individually by the many transcriptional regulators identified in the genome. Preferential @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ production may be due to high levels of expression of multiple ethanol dehydrogenases and additional pathways maximizing @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ yield. The genome also encodes three different proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments with the capacity to compartmentalize pathways that divert fermentation intermediates to various products. These characteristics make @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ an attractive resource for improving the efficiency and speed of biomass conversion to biofuels.	1
@gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ is a highly lethal, spore forming pathogen that causes soft-tissue infections, enteritis and toxic-shock syndrome. Despite the importance of @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ spores in disease, spore proteins from this bacterium have not been defined or interrogated functionally. In this study, we identified the @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ outer spore proteome and two of the identified proteins, CsA and CsB, were characterised using a genetic and phenotypic approach. Both proteins were essential for the correct formation and positioning of the @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ spore coat and exosporium. The absence of CsA reduced sporulation levels and increased spore sensitivity to heat, @sm$ sodium hydroxide @/sm$ and hydrochloric acid. By comparison, CsB was required for normal levels of spore adherence to cervical, but not vaginal, cells, with csB mutant spores having increased adherence properties. The establishment of a mouse infection model of the gastrointestinal tract for @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ allowed the role of CsA and CsB to be interrogated in an infected host. Following the oral administration of spores to mice, the wild-type strain efficiently colonized the gastrointestinal tract, with the peak of bacterial numbers occurring at one day post-infection. Colonization was reduced by two logs at four days post-infection. By comparison, mice infected with the csB mutant did not show a reduction in bacterial numbers. We conclude that @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ outer spore proteins are important for the structural and functional integrity of spores.	3
@gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ is typically resistant to sulfonamides, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$, and aminoglycosides.	4
@gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ is an emerging and uncommon human pathogen that has been under recognized due to the limitations of phenotypic identification. Here we describe two cases of bacteremia caused by @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ and summarize the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to some previous literatures, which illustrate the importance of identification and treatment of unusual organisms. The most reliable antibiotic treatment options to @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ appear to be metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, vancomycin, cefoxitin, @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$ and clindamycin.	3
@gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$ converted DZN and DHD into S-EQL but failed to metabolize glysitein or @sm$ genistein @/sm$. In contrast, S. isoflavoniconvertens was able to reduce DZN and @sm$ genistein @/sm$.	2
@gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ was the only species not carrying any defense mechanism. In addition, cas-type genes were rarely found in the genomes and were only present in ~26% of them. On the other hand, antiSMASH was used to predict biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC). Altogether, 13 different BGCs were predicted by antiSMASH in 15 out of 19 searched species (Figure S2). The three main BGCS were Type III Polyketide Synthases (T3PKS), Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RIPP), and @sm$ Terpene @/sm$, comprising 58% of all hits.	1
@gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$ induced rapid pulmonary MAIT cell expansion, by up to 580-fold over 7 days, which persisted long-term, with a similar effect observed with L. pneumophila. @sm$ 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine @/sm$ incorporation showed this was due to early, local MAIT cell proliferation in the lung and draining lymph node.	0
@gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ within the respiratory tract. Since respiratory fungal infection induces hypoxic tissue environments in the lung, receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3)-dependent induction of necroptotic cell death by inhaled conidia may provide a stimulus for IL-1alpha release. Although the impact of A. fumigatus conidia on necroptotic cell death:which favors IL-1alpha release:has not been investigated in detail, conidial @sm$ melanin @/sm$ appears to inhibit apoptotic cell death:which favors IL-1beta release:in macrophages and in epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, the presence of conidial @sm$ melanin @/sm$ and modulation of host cell death pathways may shape early IL-1alpha/beta responses during respiratory fungal infection.	0
@gm$ L. raffinolactis @/gm$ strains are capable of fermenting alpha-galactosides including raffinose and melibiose and the resulting alpha-galactose is further degraded through either the tagatose 6-phosphate or the Leloir pathway (Boucher et al., ). L. hircilactis acidifies milk well and is capable of fermenting galactose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, sucrose, mannitol, gentibiose and @sm$ starch @/sm$, whereas L.	2
@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ probiotics could fulfill this role through the production of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, lowering vaginal pH and helping to prevent the growth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms through production of hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and surface-binding proteins that inhibit adhesion of pathogens.	1
@gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ was the second most frequent SGM species with a high susceptibility rate to most first- and second-line antibiotics. These drug susceptibility patterns were markedly different from those reported by a previous study, which included DST of a total of 78 @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ strains from 13 provinces of China. Except for ethambutol (83.87% vs 20.5%), the resistance rates in our study were lower than those reported by the previous study, as follows: clarithromycin (0 vs 20.5%), amikacin (0 vs 5.1%), @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ (6.45% vs 56.4%), rifabutin (3.23%% vs 34.6%), moxifloxacin (0 vs 16.7%), and linezolid (3.23%% vs 32.1%). Our results are similar to those of a study using 85 @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ isolates from eight countries in Europe and Asia. All 85 @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ isolates were susceptible to @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$, amikacin, rifabutin, moxifloxacin, and linezolid in this study. Although all 31 @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ isolates included in our study were from 13 provinces in China, more isolates should be tested to evaluate drug susceptibility patterns of @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$, given the relatively small number of strains and regional disparities.	3
@gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium of the @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ genus. @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ metabolizes various sugars, including glucose, galactose, arabinose, lactose, and mannose, producing metabolites such as acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and isobutyric acid. @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ does not reduce nitrate and contains highly active enzymes involved in the pentose metabolism pathway. This bacterium is not sensitive to @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$ and polymyxins but is sensitive to tetracycline, lincomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and rifampicin.	4
@gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$ cultures were grown in TSB supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (YE), 5 microg/mL hemin, 2.85 mM L-cysteine hydrochloride, and 1 microg/mL menadione (@gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ growth medium [PGM]). S. sanguinis overnight cultures were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% YE (THY) at 37 C with 5% @sm$ CO2 @/sm$.	2
@gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ was negatively correlated with L-Pyroglutamic acid and 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid while positively correlated with N1-Methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, @sm$ Indoxyl sulfate @/sm$, L-Carnosine and Urea.	0
@gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ isolates formed @sm$ alcohols @/sm$ (e.g., 1-heptanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-pentanol). Specific ketones, such as 2,3-butanedione, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hexanone, 2,3-pentanedione, 2-heptanone, 5-methyl-3-hepten-2-one, and 2-nonanone were also formed. Similarly, L. fermentum formed high amounts of several @sm$ alcohols @/sm$, including 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-heptanol, 1-hexanol, 2-heptanol, 1-heptanol, 2-octen-1-ol, and 1-octanol. In contrast, L. mesenteroides formed a greater level of oxidized products such as carboxylic acids (nonanoic acid, hexanoic acid, acetic acid). Some strains exhibited mixed behaviour and catalysed reductions as well as oxidations. As an example, oat milk fermented by L. rhamnosus contained specific @sm$ alcohols @/sm$ (2-octen-1-ol, 1-octanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol), ketones (3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-heptanone), and organic acids (acetic acid, 3-methyl-butanoic acid, 2-methyl-butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, pentanoic acid). For some strains, the catalysed chemistry differed with the plant material. In sunflower seed milk and faba milk, L. johnsonii NCC553 prominently formed @sm$ alcohols @/sm$.	1
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$, a host-adapted pathogen of swine, usually causes septicemia. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains have been widely studied in recent years for their probiotic properties. In this study, a mouse infection model first screened for potential agents against infection, then a pig infection model evaluated effects of LAB strains and herbal plants against infection. Scutellariae radix (SR) and Gardeniae fructus (GF) showed abilities to reduce bacteria shedding and suppressing serum level of TNF- alpha induced by infection in swine. Bioactivities of SR and GF were enhanced by combining with LAB strains, which alone could speed up the bacteria elimination time in feces and boost immunity of infected pigs. @sm$ Baicalein @/sm$ and genipin exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than baicalin and geniposide did, as well as prevent @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ from invading macrophages.	3
@gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$-oralis is a leading cause of IE. Treatment of this pathogen is limited by frequent high-level beta-lactam resistance and the propensity to develop high-level DAP-R during DAP exposure. The current study elucidated key metabolic perturbations associated with high-level DAP-R in prototype @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$-oralis strain 351, following in vitro selection of DAP-R by 10-day serial passage in sub-inhibitory DAP. Furthermore, to test translatability of such metabolic changes (see below), the synergistic activity of combinations of DAP plus a strategic metabolic inhibitor (i.e., @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$) vs. DAP or @sm$ fosfomycin @/sm$ alone was assessed, using DAP-R @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$-oralis strain 351-D10 (MIC >256 microg/mL) in vitro and in an ex vivo IE model.	4
@sm$ 2(5H)-Furanone @/sm$ derivatives have been previously reported to increase the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics. In particular, F105 exhibits pronounced synergy with aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamycin, and amikacin) and benzalkonium chloride, significantly reducing the MICs of these compounds for @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$.	3
@sm$ Acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate are the most abundant SCFAs in gastrointestinal tract (>=95%), whereas formate, valerate, caproate, etc., make up the remaining (den Besten et al.,). @sm$ Acetate @/sm$ and propionate are mainly produced by Bacteroidetes whereas Firmicutes are the primary contributors of butyrate (Levy et al.,). Studies have found out that @sm$ acetate @/sm$ is produced by most of the enteric bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. via Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and acetyl-CoA pathwy (Louis et al.,; Fernandez et al.,). Propionate is produced by @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$, Bacteroides spp., Dialister spp., Megasphaera elsdenii, Veillonella spp. Coprococcus catus, Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus obeum, Salmonella spp., via succinate pathway, acrylate pathway, and propanediol pathway (Koh et al.,). Butyrate is produced by Roseburia spp. Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium leptum, Eubacterium hallii, Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, Anaerostipes caccae, and Coprococcus catus via the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase routes and the phosphotransbutyrylase/butyrate kinase routes (Fernandez et al.,; Koh et al.,). The molar ratio of @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate, and butyrate in the colon and stool is about 3:1:1 (Canfora et al.,).	1
@sm$ Carnosic acid @/sm$ and carnosol as the major constituents of rosemary extract are found to have high antibacterial activity against various microorganisms including Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, S.	3
@sm$ Cellulose @/sm$ degrading bacteria isolated from the gut of different snails are also found in O. strigosa, these include many members of Enterobacter, Bacillus, and members of genus @gm$ Sphingobacterium @/gm$, including S.	2
@sm$ Flavonols @/sm$ also occur in glycosylated form, bound to glucose, rhamnose, or rutinose. The most common glycosidic form of quercetin is rutin (a glycoside combining quercetin and the disaccharide rutinose). The alpha-L-rhamnosidases intervene in rutin utilization via gut microbial species; @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$ and B. pseudocatenulatum were shown to degrade glycosylated flavanols. Recently, Riva and colleagues identified which gut microbes were metabolically active after the amendment of rutin using a fluorescence-based single-cell activity measure (biorthogonal non-canonical ammino-acid-tagging (BONCAT)) combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Lachnospiraceae (Lachnoclostridium and Eisenbergiella), Enterobacteriaceae, Tannerellaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae species were included in the rutin-responsive fraction of the gut microbiota. Specifically, Enterobacteriaceae was associated with the conversion of rutin to quercetin-3-glucoside (Q-glc), and Lachnospiraceae was associated with quercetin (Q) production. Although Verrucomicrobiaceae was not included within the rutin-responsive group, this study uncovered the contribution of other bacterial taxa in degrading @sm$ flavonols @/sm$ and how they might support A.	2
@sm$ Hexanoic acid @/sm$ and its derivatives are generally used for the production of artificial flavors and food additives, as well as plastics, rubber, transportation fuel, and pharmaceuticals. Although they are mainly produced via the multi-step chemical conversion of petroleum products and natural oils, recently, microbial cell factories have been considered as a promising approach for the sustained production of this straight six-carbon chain carboxylic acid. For example, Clostridium kluyveri synthesizes @sm$ hexanoic acid @/sm$ by fermenting ethanol with acetate or succinate. Rhodospirillum rubrum and Clostridium scatologenes are other @sm$ hexanoic acid @/sm$ producers utilizing pyruvic acid and methanol as carbon sources, respectively. Furthermore, @sm$ hexanoic acid @/sm$ can be also produced in @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ fueled by glucose, maltose, and sucrose. Among such potential producers, @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ has noticeable advantages, as it can consume diverse carbohydrates such as starch, mannitol, glucose, maltose, and sucrose, which are economic carbon sources, and also achieve higher titre of @sm$ hexanoic acid @/sm$ compared with other candidates, namely, 19 g/L and 28.42 g/L from glucose and sucrose, respectively.	1
@sm$ Isoflavones @/sm$ are mainly found in legumes. B. breve MCC1274 possesses the highest beta-glucosidase activity for the conversion of daidzin to daidzein. The anthocyanin cyanidin 3-glucoside is converted to cyanidin by @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ and Clostridium saccharogumia.	2
@sm$ Mercury @/sm$ resistant strains (n = 28) were further identified using the 16S rDNA-RFLP pattern. Species assignation were completed by PCR amplification and sequencing of rpoD gene. Strains not yielding an rpoD amplicon were identified by gyrA amplification and sequencing. Using these approaches, the following species were found: @gm$ A hydrophila @/gm$ (n = 11), A.	4
@sm$ Methanol @/sm$ is already an important carbon feedstock in the chemical industry, but it has found only limited application in biotechnological production processes. This can be mostly attributed to the inability of most microbial platform organisms to utilize @sm$ methanol @/sm$ as a carbon and energy source. With the aim to turn @sm$ methanol @/sm$ into a suitable feedstock for microbial production processes, we engineered the industrially important but nonmethylotrophic bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum toward the utilization of @sm$ methanol @/sm$ as an auxiliary carbon source in a sugar-based medium. Initial oxidation of @sm$ methanol @/sm$ to formaldehyde was achieved by heterologous expression of a methanol dehydrogenase from @gm$ Bacillus methanolicus @/gm$, whereas assimilation of formaldehyde was realized by implementing the two key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate pathway of Bacillus subtilis: 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase. The recombinant C. glutamicum strain showed an average @sm$ methanol @/sm$ consumption rate of 1.7 +- 0.3 mM/h (mean +- standard deviation) in a glucose-@sm$ methanol @/sm$ medium, and the culture grew to a higher cell density than in medium without @sm$ methanol @/sm$. In addition, [(13)C]methanol-labeling experiments revealed labeling fractions of 3 to 10% in the m + 1 mass isotopomers of various intracellular metabolites. In the background of a C. glutamicum Deltaald DeltaadhE mutant being strongly impaired in its ability to oxidize formaldehyde to CO2, the m + 1 labeling of these intermediates was increased (8 to 25%), pointing toward higher formaldehyde assimilation capabilities of this strain. The engineered C. glutamicum strains represent a promising starting point for the development of sugar-based biotechnological production processes using @sm$ methanol @/sm$ as an auxiliary substrate.	1
@sm$ Obacunone @/sm$ belongs to a class of unique triterpenoids called limonoids, present in Citrus species. Previous studies from our laboratory suggested that @sm$ obacunone @/sm$ possesses antivirulence activity and demonstrates inhibition of cell-cell signaling in Vibrio harveyi and @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$. The present work sought to determine the effect of @sm$ obacunone @/sm$ on the food-borne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 by using a cDNA microarray. Transcriptomic studies indicated that @sm$ obacunone @/sm$ represses Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), the maltose transporter, and the hydrogenase operon. Furthermore, phenotypic data for the Caco-2 infection assay and maltose utilization were in agreement with microarray data suggesting repression of SPI1 and maltose transport. Further studies demonstrated that repression of SPI1 was plausibly mediated through hilA. Additionally, @sm$ obacunone @/sm$ seems to repress SPI2 under SPI2-inducing conditions as well as in Caco-2 infection models. Furthermore, obacunone seems to repress hilA in an EnvZ-dependent fashion. Altogether, the results of the study seems to suggest that @sm$ obacunone @/sm$ exerts an antivirulence effect on S.	3
@sm$ Polysaccharides @/sm$ from animals, plants and varieties of microorganisms have been proven to exhibit functional and physicochemical properties, e.g., their antioxidant and immunological activity, rheological properties, water retention ability and filming capacity. Currently, water-soluble @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ have attracted increasing interest owing to their biological activities and potential processing properties. Compared with the plant- and algae-derived water-soluble @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$, exopolysaccharides (EPSs) from microorganisms occupy only a small part of the market. The bioactivity of EPS has been linked to their specific structure, including monosaccharide composition, molecular weight (Mw) and linkage pattern, as well as culture conditions. EPS obtained from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally composed of a single type of sugar subunit (homopolysaccharide) or consist of several types of sugar subunits (heteropolysaccharide). As a typical homopolysaccharide and hydrocolloid, dextran and its derivatives have attracted great attention for its industrial and medical applications. Leuconostoc species are the primary producers of dextran with different structures and probiotic properties. According to previous research, the EPS from Lc. citreum B-2 was confirmed to be a glucan with a highly branched structure and showed certain antioxidant potential. Another EPS derived from @gm$ L.citreum @/gm$ NM105 was also characterized to be a water-soluble @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ with alpha-(1 6) linkage in the backbone with alpha-(1 2) linkage in the branch point.	1
@sm$ Reactive oxygen species @/sm$ (@sm$ ROS @/sm$), such as hydrogen peroxide, are known to contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis as part of the pro-inflammatory immune response, thus suggesting probiotics are able to target other inflammatory mediators as well as cytokines. Furthermore, @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ induced a decrease in mRNA expression of stromal-derived factor-1 receptor, CXCR4, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis prevention; on the down side however, also suppressed MHC-class I expression. As antigen presenting cells (APCs) use MHC-I molecules to present antigen to CD8+ Tc, an important component of tumour surveillance, the findings of Chen et al., present a potential drawback to the use of @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$. Activation of CD8+ Tc is desirable within the tumour microenvironment due to their anti-tumoural, cytotoxic characteristics; therefore, probiotic-mediated down-regulation of CD8+ Tc activation may perpetuate tumour growth and survival. In terms of gross pathology, @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ has been found to decrease tumour growth by 50% in comparison to non-treated mice and enhance the apoptosis of CT-26 cancer cells, suggesting the immunomodulatory effects of probiotic administration does have an impact on tissue ultrastructure.	3
@sm$ Sarcosine @/sm$ and synthesized complexes (1)-(6) were tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains including @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ and S.	3
@sm$ Sulfur @/sm$-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine produce sulfides under the action of intestinal bacteria, which are mainly produced by the desulfurization reaction of intestinal bacteria. Studies have found that bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ and Enterobacter aerogenes in the large intestine can lyse @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-containing amino acids.	2
@sm$ Sulfur @/sm$-containing wastewater is very common as an industrial waste, yet a high-efficiency composite microbial agent for @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-containing wastewater treatment is still lacking. In this work, three novel and efficient desulfurizing bacteria were isolated from the sewage treatment tank of Zhejiang Satellite Energy Co., Ltd. They were identified as @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ (S1), Ochrobactrum oryzae (S8), and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (S9). These three strains of bacteria were responsible for the oxidative metabolism of sodium sulfide via a similar polythionate pathway, which could be expressed as follows: S2- S2O32-/S0 SO32- SO42-. Activated carbon, wheat bran, and diatomite at 1:1:1 ratio are used as carriers to construct a composite microbial agent containing the three bacteria. The desulfurization efficiency of 95% was predicted by response surface methodology under the following optimum conditions: the dosage of the inoculum was 3 g/L, pH 7.86, and temperature of 39  C. Additionally, the impact resistance was studied in the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor. The removal capacity of microbial agent reached 98%. High-throughput analysis showed that composite microbial agent increased bacterial evenness and diversity, and the relative abundance of Brucellaceae increased from 5.04 to 8.79% in the reactor. In the process of industrial wastewater transformation, the transformation rate of sulfide by composite microbial agent was maintained between 70 and 81%. The composite microbial agent had potential for the treatment of @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-containing wastewater.	1
@sm$ Thioridazine @/sm$ (@sm$ Th @/sm$), which is therapeutically used in psychiatric patients, was found to possess conspicuous antimicrobial activity when tested against 316 strains belonging to a number of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Although Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio chloerae and @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ were found to be most sensitive, @sm$ Th @/sm$ was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and bacteriostatic for vibrios and other Gram negative organisms. In the study of antiplasmid/curing effect of @sm$ Th @/sm$ on twelve multiply antibiotic and @sm$ Th @/sm$ resistant bacteria, it was observed that elimination of R plasmids was facilitated by choice of optimal concentration of @sm$ Th @/sm$.	3
A box containing 56 capsules, each containing 5 x 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ LA806 with corn starch and @sm$ magnesium stearate @/sm$ as excipients (Lactiplus, PiLeJe Laboratoire), was given to each patient enrolled by the investigators at the end of V1.	0
A clinical study involving 106 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM found that acarbose treatment can significantly change the gut microbiota composition compared to glipizide, especially increasing the abundance of species possessing high BSH activity, such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum, while depleting putrefactive species of Bacteroides, Alistipes and @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$, thereby changing the relative abundance of microbial genes involved in @sm$ BA @/sm$ metabolism and contributing to beneficial effects on the host metabolism (Gu et al.,).	2
A comparison between control mice and all antidepressant groups together revealed that Ruminococcus, @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ and an undefined genus in the order RF32, class Alphaproteobacteria were less abundant in antidepressant treated mice (Fig. 2a, b). When analyzing the effects of each individual antidepressant in comparison to control using pairwise comparisons, the same genera were shown to be less abundant in escitalopram, venlafaxine, @sm$ duloxetine @/sm$ and desipramine groups, but not in fluoxetine group (Supplemental Figure S2). Further, in both the overall effects of antidepressants and in the pairwise analysis, the differences in genus @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ contributed to observed decreased abundance of family Coriobacteriaceae, order Coriobacteriales, class Coriobacteriia, phylum Actinobacteria in antidepressant groups (Fig. 2a, b; Supplemental Figure S2). In addition to the LEfSe analysis, we further analyzed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data with PERMANOVA (Supplementary Table 2). At the genus level, both Ruminococcus and @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ were effected by antidepressant treatment (p < 0.05), although only @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ remained significant after corrections for multiple comparisons. In direct pairwise analysis between control and each of the antidepressant groups, some antidepressants significantly decreased levels of Ruminococcus, although they were no longer significant after corrections for multiple comparisons. Therefore, the findings of decrease in Ruminococcus and @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ were more significant in the LEfSe analysis, and we further explored these findings using qRT-PCR.	3
A new series of novel bis[1, 2, 4]triazolo[3, 4-b][1, 3, 4]thiadiazines 7a-j has been synthesized by the reaction of [5, 5'-methylenebis(3-methylbenzofuran-7, 5-diyl)]bis[(4-amino-5-thioxo-4, 5-dihydro-1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl)methanone] (6) with a variety of @sm$ phenacyl bromides @/sm$ in ethanol under reflux for 6 h. All the newly synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro activity against certain strains of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ and Shigella flexneri.	3
A novel role for ProP as @sm$ carnitine @/sm$ uptake system has been recently described in @gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ BAA-894 (member of the family Enterobacteriaceae). The uptake of @sm$ carnitine @/sm$ by ProP provided the strain with a higher osmotolerance, being able to grow under salt concentrations far in excess of that afforded by proline.	2
A production of 3 2 g l(-1) of lichenysin was achieved with an optimum medium containing 107 82 g l(-1) of molasses, 6 47 g l(-1) of @sm$ NaNO3 @/sm$ and 9 7 g l(-1) of K2 HPO4 /KH2 PO4 , in which molasses and phosphate salts had a significant effect on biosurfactant production. Lichenysin was effectively applied in a surface pre-treatment to avoid microbial biofilm development of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (68 73%) and Candida albicans (74 35%), with ED50 values of 8 3 and 17 2 mug ml(-1) respectively. It was also very efficient in a surface post-treatment to remove biofilms of MRSA (55 74%) and @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ (51 51%), with an ED50 of 2 79 and 4 09 mug ml(-1) respectively.	0
A protein (NosA) in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas stutzeri that is required for @sm$ copper @/sm$ to be inserted into N2O reductase has been extracted and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein could form channels in black lipid bilayers. Like N2O reductase, NosA contained @sm$ copper @/sm$ and was only made anaerobically. In contrast to N2O reductase, its synthesis was repressed by exogenous @sm$ copper @/sm$ (but not by Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, or Fe). Also in contrast to N2O reductase, NosA homologs were not immunologically detectable in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, or other strains of P.	3
A quantity of 726 differentially abundant serum metabolites, including a cluster of @sm$ fatty acyl-CoAs @/sm$ enriched in IBS, have been identified. Furthermore, three species, including @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, E.	0
A recent study reports a detailed list of 29 intestinal bacterial strains that biotransform @sm$ isoflavones @/sm$ to equol. Among the bacteria found in the human intestine are @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ Clostridium like bacterium and Escherichia coli sp, Eggerthella sp, and Lactobacillus mucosae.	2
A study showed that uridine triphosphate could indirectly increase intracellular Ca2+ levels, inhibit hepatic stellate cell proliferation, and promote apoptosis through the CaMK II/Ca2+ signaling pathway, which was accorded with our study that @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ KLDS1.0901 also activated calcium signaling pathway. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating survival signals in many neuronal cell types. It may be antagonized by the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). AKT's central role in the PI3Ks pathway makes it one of the most activated downstream effectors in the oncogenic landscape. Huang et al. found that gigantol could inhibit the proliferation and significantly potentiate the anticancer activities of cisplatin (DDP) in breast cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In our study, @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ KLDS1.0901 affected apoptosis through key genes of PTEN and AKT in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. NF-kappaB signaling pathway in immunoregulatory functions is well accepted. Activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway leads to the induction of target genes that can interfere with apoptosis and the cell cycle. studied that @sm$ quinacrine @/sm$ abrogates NF-kappaB activation and stimulates apoptosis by increasing the cytotoxicity of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in RKO and HT-29 cells. @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ KLDS1.0901 could induce the NF-kappaB signaling pathway through NIK and TRAF6.	1
AIMS: To determine the rate of reduction of @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$ by stainless steel surfaces with zeolite ceramic coatings containing 2.5% (w/w) silver (Ag) and 14% zinc (@sm$ Zn @/sm$) ions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stainless steel pans with and without Ag/@sm$ Zn @/sm$ coatings were inoculated with solutions of Leg. pneumophila ATCC 33155 and incubated at 37 degrees C. Survival was monitored using the spread-plate technique on selective buffered charcoal yeast extract agar. Significant reductions of Leg. pneumophila were effected by the Ag/@sm$ Zn @/sm$ zeolite coatings within 2 h of exposure. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Zeolite ceramic Ag/@sm$ Zn @/sm$ coatings impart significant anti-@gm$ Legionella @/gm$ properties to stainless steel surfaces. Coated stainless steel could be used in the manufacture of air ducts, condensation pans and intake and exhaust vents. These products have the potential to reduce numbers of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ in air-handling systems.	3
Abundant genomic data of sequenced bifidobacteria confirm the remarkable array of genes encoding for glycosyl hydrolases, whose involvement in the release of bioactive aglycones from dietary @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ has recently been claimed. However, the real contribution of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species in the hydrolysis of specific @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ still needs to be proven.	2
According to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic characteristics, the similarity of the LC-9-1 strain to @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ spp. was 99.9% (Figure 3E); thus, the strain was preliminarily identified as @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$. Biochemical analysis was performed using the API 50 CHL strip kit and the strip capsules turned yellow, indicating a complete fermentation of sugar by strain. The API web software confirmed that LC-9-1 utilized carbohydrates including Salicin, D-cellobiose, @sm$ D-ribose @/sm$, D-xylose, D-saccharose, D-trehalose, D-galactose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, Gentiobiose, D-tagatose, N-acetylglucosamine, Amygdalin, Arbutin and Esculin (Supplementary Table S2). The strain exhibited no difference in color change compared to the standard strain of @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ ATCC 8042, suggesting that both strains had the same fermentation of sugar pathways. Taken together, LC-9-1 was identified as @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ and has been deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC, Beijing, China), with the patent number (CGMCC No.	2
Accordingly, specific genera belonging to this phylum, such as Faecalibacterium, Blautia, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$, and Roseburia strongly enriched in HC or DEP-sertraline-treated adolescents, which indicated the potential sensitivity of these bacterial genera to alterations of the @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ levels.	3
Acetyl-CoA may be converted to acetate, with the concomitant production of ATP, either indirectly through an @sm$ acetyl phosphate @/sm$ intermediate using phosphotransacetylase (pta) and acetate kinase (ack), or directly via acetate thiokinase (atk). Although both reactions produce ATP, the former uses ADP and Pi whereas the latter uses AMP and inorganic PPi as substrates for ATP synthesis. As a result, acetate production via pta and ack is more thermodynamically favorable than via atk ( G ' = -3.9 vs. +6.0 kJ/mol, respectively) which is typically used for acetate assimilation. Of the organisms surveyed, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$, G.	2
Acne is caused by multiple factors such as increased sebum secretion, inflammation, follicular keratinization, and @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$. Excessive sebum production, abnormal sebum composition, sebum peroxidation, and inflammatory @sm$ lipid @/sm$ production contribute to the formation of primary acne lesions.	0
Acne vulgaris is a very common skin disease, typical of adolescents and young adults, with multifactorial aetiology, including comedogenesis, seborrhoea, bacteria colonization and inflammation.1, 2, 3 The precise mechanism behind the onset of acne lesions is still not fully understood, and the role of @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ is still largely discussed.4, 5 Although P acnes is observed in normal and acne skin, intense P acnes colonization of the sebaceous gland likely play a role in acne inflammation through bacterial antigens and creation of a biofilm.4, 5, 6 The intense C acnes colonization causes inflammatory reactions and immune cell recruitment.6 The bacteria's metabolism is also known to modify the skin's lipid composition. Namely, bacterial lipase activity liberates free fatty acids (FFA) from @sm$ triglycerides @/sm$ (@sm$ TG @/sm$). Free fatty acids being much more viscous than @sm$ TG @/sm$, they contribute to the obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit, which then becomes anaerobic, leading to a P acnes proliferation.	1
Across the metabolic networks of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ strains, most reactions were conserved, including arginine metabolism and central carbon metabolism (S7 Table). Tryptophan and riboflavin auxotrophies were also predicted to be conserved across strains. Variable reactions tended to be in the subsystems of transport, fatty acid biosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, and nucleotide interconversion (S9A Fig). Consistent with the central role of arginine metabolism, @sm$ ornithine @/sm$ and citrulline levels in our metabolomics dataset were very consistent across strains. @sm$ Ornithine @/sm$ was among the least variable metabolite features (Fig 4D), and one of the most correlated with biomass (as estimated by optical density, Spearman rho = 0.36, FDR-adjusted p = 0.1).	0
Activity against Acinetobacter baumannii-@gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$ spp. complex (n=2101) and other @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. (n=292) was assessed, and omadacycline inhibited growth of 91.5% and 95.5% of the isolates at less than or equal to 4 mg/L, respectively.10 Against 315 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates, omadacycline inhibited growth of 82.2% of the organisms evaluated.10 Against other multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, omadacycline inhibited 85.3% of non-@sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$-susceptible (n=1439) and 52.7% of non-imipenem-susceptible isolates (n=277).8.	3
Activity of the enzyme was confirmed for each assay by observing complete dephosphorylation of 20 muM adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and @sm$ R848 @/sm$, a TLR7/8-activating imidazoquinoline compound that does not have a phosphate group, was included as a negative control. Human TNAP significantly dephosphorylated the double-stranded RNA mimic Poly I:C (p = 0.002, TLR3A) as well as LPS from @gm$ Klebsiella pneumonia @/gm$ (p = 0.0006) and Salmonella minnesota Re595 (p = 0.009, TLR4As; Fig 1).	0
Additionally, @sm$ cholic acid @/sm$ and chenodeoxycholate were found to be negatively correlated with Dehalobacterium. Furthermore, Porphyromonas is positively correlated with deoxycholic acid, while Coprococcus and Dehalobacterium are positively correlated with succinate (Fig. 5a). Similarly, the coalition analysis of significant difference in microbiota and metabolites between the control_IB groups shows that uracil, thymine, and cytosine, as the key metabolites involved in pyrimidine metabolism signaling pathway, have the same expression pattern (Fig. 5b and c). These are positively correlated with Prevotella and are negatively correlated with @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and Flexispira, respectively. @sm$ Cholic acid @/sm$, chenodeoxycholate, and deoxycholic acid show similar expression patterns and are positively correlated with Prevotella, Flexispira, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, except for deoxycholic acid.	3
Additionally, butyrate promotes memory cell differentiation of CD8+ T cells via uncoupling of the @sm$ TCA @/sm$ cycle from glycolysis and promotion of fatty acid oxidation. The positive effect of butyrate on CD8+ T cell memory response was dependent on GPR41 and GPR43. Another SCFA, pentanoate produced by human commensal bacteria @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ induced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in CD8+ T cells in vitro and enhanced anti-tumor activity of Ag-specific T cells in mice.	1
Additionally, it plays a role in inhibiting @sm$ lipid @/sm$ oxidation and contamination by pathogenic microbes including @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$ in cured meat products.	4
Adhered cells were infected with @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ at an MOI of 100:1 (bacteria: cells). Uninfected cells supplemented with BHI broth were used as a control. Both infected and uninfected HT-29 were incubated anaerobically at 37 C for 2 hr. Later, the growth media was moved and cell monolayers were washed three times with 1x @sm$ PBS @/sm$.	0
After 48 h of incubation in anaerobic conditions (90% @sm$ N2 @/sm$, 5% H2, 5% CO2) (Bactron Anaerobic Chamber, USA) at 37 C, brown or reddish-brown colonies 2 mm to 3 mm in diameter were selected for further identification. A fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) test was performed to ensure that the colonies selected were Bifidobacteria . To identify the isolated Bifidobacterium spp. at the species level, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed by Bio leaders (Daejeon, Korea). We established an N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced mutant of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ SPM1005, which we named SPM1005-A. @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ SPM1005-A, was cultured at 37 C for 48 h on general anaerobic medium (GAM, Nissui Pharm, Japan) under anaerobic conditions and then centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 15 minutes.	0
After 48 h, @sm$ puromycin @/sm$ (5 mug/ml) was added to the medium to eliminate the GTCs uninfected by the lentivirus. The transfected GTCs were harvested after 72 h, and total proteins were isolated to detect GPR78 gene expression. The GTCs were then infected with @gm$ B.suis @/gm$.S2 at an MOI of 100; the GTCs and supernatants were harvested, and relevant experiments were performed at specific times (12, 24, or 48 h).	3
After all, similar to Bifidobacterium in humans, Bacteroides serves to break down the complex milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ in pigs. In addition, Bacteroides has likewise been identified as a primary degrader, capable of cross-feeding with other SCFA-producing species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Anaerostipes caccae, @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$, and Subdoligranulum and within the Bacteroides genus.	2
After constructing the butanoate metabolism and benzoate degradation pathways of @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, it can be seen from Figure 6A that @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ had five enzymes in the butyrate metabolism pathway that generated methyl butyrate from acetyl-CoA, among which EC: 2.8.3.8, EC: 4.2.1.17, EC: 1.1. 1.157, and EC: 2.3.1.9 were all annotated, and only EC: 1.3.1.44 and EC: 1.1.1.86 were not annotated. The pathway integrity was 80%, and we speculate that they could cooperate with other bacteria to produce @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$.	1
Akkermansia spp, and @gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ groups. It should be noted that the results of studies on the change in relative abundance of Bacteroides spp. Are inconsistent: one study showed an increase, while another showed no significant change. Furthermore, the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. In the feces of mice treated with risperidone was negatively correlated with serum LDL levels; E. coli was negatively correlated with serum @sm$ TG @/sm$ levels.	0
Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and @sm$ d-glutamine @/sm$ and d-glutamate metabolism were both related to mitochondrial functions. Glutamate can be produced by several representing environmental bacteria or strains used in food fermentation and also be synthesized by lactic acid bacteria strains such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei. Gut microbiota, including @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ and B.	2
All @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains were cultivated in an anaerobic atmosphere (2.99% H2, 17.01% CO2 and 80% N2) in a chamber (Concept 400, Ruskin) on De Man-Rogosa-Sharp (MRS) broth (Scharlau Chemie, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) @sm$ L-cysteine hydrochloride @/sm$ and incubated at 37  C.	2
All @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species and Acinetobacter species isolated were subjected to disk-diffusion susceptibility testing. Antibiotic discs of ceftazidime, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin, amikacin, @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ was used for @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species. Similarly, all Acinetobacter isolates were tested by using meropenem, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Then, isolates with reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime and/or meropenem for @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ spp., and meropenem or imipenem for Acinetobacter spp. were selected for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the newer antimicrobials (cefiderocol, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and imipenem-relebactam for @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ spp., and cefiderocol, meropenem, imipenem, and imipenem-relebactam for Acinetobacter spp.	3
All OTUs of the Acidaminococcaceae family were assigned to the genus of the succinate-fermenting Succiniclasticum (van Gylswyk,) and 48 of 70 identified proteins were produced by the asaccharolytic and succinate-utilizing @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ species (Watanabe et al.,). Succiniclasticum and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ species of the Acidaminococcaceae family ferment succinate to produce propionate (Figure 8), the most important @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source for the ruminant's gluconeogenesis (Yost et al.,). In total six proteins of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ species involved in propionate production were identified (Table S7). There are reports about reduced methane emissions under corn silage-based dietary regimen (Beauchemin and McGinn,; van Gastelen et al.,). A metagenomics study linked a decrease in methane emissions and abundance of methanogenic archaea to an increased abundance of the Succinivibrionaceae family (Wallace et al.,) whose members utilize hydrogen to produce succinate which is then rapidly converted to propionate and in this compete with the most common, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Liu and Whitman,; McCabe et al.,). Concerning the present study, the ratio of acetate to propionate, an indicator for methanogenic activity, was lowest in the corn silage-based diet (Table 3). Furthermore, the increased abundance levels of the Succinivibrionaceae family (Figure 2), the higher amount of succinate (Table 3) and the increased abundance of six propionate-producing @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ proteins in the fractions of the corn silage-based diet may indicate a consistency with the above-mentioned investigations.	1
All patients positive to fructose intolerance underwent a fructose- and @sm$ sorbitol @/sm$-free diet for 30 days. All subjects who did not report an improvement of symptoms after diet were enrolled in the trial and started the treatment with 1 capsule per day of EQBIOTA  (L. plantarum CECT 7484 one billion CFU, L. plantarum CECT 748 one billion CFU, and @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ CECT 7483 one billion CFU based on cell survival assays).	0
All strains encoded the required enzymes for glycolytic conversion of glucose to @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ (Table S11). Notably, only the @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ strain appeared to encode a complete and intact pentose phosphate pathway.	2
All the fungal extracts were tested against four gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), Bacillus megaterium (ATCC 25918), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6059), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and six gram-negative bacteria including Salmonella typhi (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 28739), @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ (ATCC 33653), Shigella dysenteriae (ATCC 26131), Shigella boydii (ATCC 13147) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27833). To determine the antifungal activity, two pathogenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were used. The test microorganisms were inoculated on nutrient agar (for bacteria) and PDA medium (for fungi). The test samples (crude fungal extracts) were prepared (100 microg/disc) and kanamycin (30 microg/disc) and @sm$ ketoconazole @/sm$ (30 microg/disc) standard discs were used as the reference.	3
Although @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ and/or prednisolone are widely used for the treatment of canine CE, little information regarding their effects on GI microbiota have been reported. Thus, this study was performed to provide basic information on the effects of these drugs on GI microbiota using single breed dogs, and controlling for diet and environment. Our data suggest that @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ altered the bacterial composition and reduced bacterial diversity, whereas prednisolone did not; furthermore, the effect of @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ was transient, and ceased within 4 weeks of drug cessation. In contrast, a recent study showed that a combination therapy of @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ and prednisone administered for 60 days followed by a 30-day washout interval did not alter the proportions of several bacterial groups (as detected with quantitative PCR), including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Escherichia coli, and C. perfringens . The discrepancy between this clinical study and our current research regarding the effect of @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ may be due to the disease status of individuals, presence of washout intervals, and/or methodological differences.	3
Although C-S bond cleavage had not been reported for any GRE, the amino acid sequence of the identified Bilophila GRE resembles the sequences of the C-O bond-cleaving GRE 1,2-propanediol dehydratase from @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ (32% identity), which converts 1,2-propanediol to water and propionaldehyde (propanal), and the C-N bond-cleaving GRE choline trimethylamine-lyase (CutC) from D. alaskensis G20 (31% identity), which metabolizes choline to @sm$ trimethylamine @/sm$ and acetaldehyde.	1
Although a combination of @sm$ oxytetracycline @/sm$ (@sm$ OTC @/sm$) and dihydrostreptomycin has been successfully used to treat brucellosis in small ruminants, therapeutic regimens are prolonged and expensive, essentially making them unfeasible for use in developing countries. Monotherapy has proven inadequate for treating brucellosis, as relapses in humans are common. This may be due to bacteriostatic effects of commonly used antibiotics, especially tetracyclines, and the intracellular nature of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp.. As new classes of antibiotics become available, specifically long-lasting or extended release antimicrobials, monotherapy may become feasible for addressing brucellosis in natural reservoirs. First generation macrolide antibiotics were proposed as potential agents against brucellosis and initial studies in vitro demonstrated promising results against several strains of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$.	3
Although all S.oralis from the AT patients were isolated using BHI, their proteome differentiation was much higher than that of isolates detected among the non-AT, which can be associated with a different antibiotic treatment:ciprofloxacin (AT9), @sm$ azithromycin @/sm$ (AT1), and clindamycin (AT5). Regarding the other two strains found in both patients group:S. salivarius and @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$:the comparative analysis revealed the highest proteomic variations; however, grouping according to drug-treated and untreated patients was not as evident as in the former cases. Nonetheless, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ strains isolated from the AT patients were placed into different clusters according to the type of antibiotic used, where strains from piperacillin-treated patients (AT10 and 12) were much more similar to each other than those from ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and clindamycin with levofloxacin (Fig. 4B). Additionally, great diversity noted for @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ can be related to various microbiota found in the saliva samples.	3
"Although most @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species physiologically colonize in oral and gut mucosa, a small number of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ show pathobiontic properties and have been confirmed to participate in opportunistic infections. Distinct from intestinal native microbes, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ owns a unique @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ assimilation metabolic network that rarely limits their growth. Jong Nam Kim et al. observed different patterns of transcript abundances in genes involving ammonium assimilation between the classical ""enteric paradigm"" and Pretovella. Pretovella act as a vital keystone bacterium of the gut. Binding or attaching to other bacteria and epithelium, Pretovella creates a larger infection than in previously infected areas. A higher abundance of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens (Pretovella species that are commonly resident in the oral cavity) was observed in the intestine of CRC patients. In mice experiments, oral administration of P. intermedia induces NAFLD. In terms of IBD, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is a potential alternative biomarker for UC, tightly matched with feces and other oral areas. Moreover, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ predominates in the intestinal microbiome in the preclinical phase of rheumatoid arthritis, promoting pathological progression in a TH17 cell-dependent manner. In a metagenome-wide association study (MWAS) of the gut microbiome from rheumatoid arthritis patients, Toshihiro Kishikawa et al. identified five species that belong to the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ (i.e., @gm$ P. denticola @/gm$, P. marshii, P. disiens, P. corporis, and P. amnii). Additionally, the major task for intestinal @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is metabolizing various proteins and carbohydrates. Consequently, high animal protein and saturated fat diet western people own higher diversity of inflammation-associated @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ in the oral cavity, with intestinal microbes demonstrating upregulated virulence factor and antibiotic resistance gene levels.."	2
Among the 29 negative ELISA samples, 22 were confirmed positive by WB, and the lowest S/@sm$ CO @/sm$ was 0.232. Therefore, in clinical work, special attention should be paid to the samples with S/@sm$ CO @/sm$ < 1, and the chromogenic enzyme plate should be visible to the naked eye. Confirmed by WB, 93 cases (57.06%) were negative, 31 cases (19.02%) were positive, and 39 cases (23.93%) were suspicious. The 39 anti-@gm$ TP @/gm$ antibody samples with a suspicious result by WB were retrospectively followed up.	0
Among the 47 @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ isolates, 5 phenotypic resistance patterns were observed. Most of the isolates (26 isolates; 55.3%) were resistant to doxycycline, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin (DC-TC-EF-NX). Two isolates were resistant to doxycycline, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin (DC-EF-NX), two to fluoroquinolones (EF-NX), one to tetracyclines (DC-TC), and three to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ (@sm$ TC @/sm$).	4
Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, antibiotics such as @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$ (52.4%), cefepime (61.9%), cefoxitin (66.7%), piperacillin-tazobactam (71.9%), amikacin (85.7%) and meropenem (95.2%) exhibited moderate to high potency against all Gram-negative isolates. Ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were least effective with only 4.8% of the isolates being sensitive. High level of resistance was observed among K. pneumoniae followed by E. coli isolates. Among K. pneumoniae isolates, resistance was observed in ampicillin (100%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (85.7%) and third generation cephalosporins (71.4%) respectively. Resistance to gentamicin, one of the first line empiric antimicrobial in our setting, was 57.1% among K. pneumoniae isolates. Against third generation cephalosporins that is ceftriaxone, an empiric antimicrobial in the local Essential Medicines List and Standard Treatment Guidelines for Zimbabwe (EDLIZ), and ceftazidime, resistance was observed in 71.4% of these isolates. However, isolates were fully sensitive to amikacin and meropenem and moderately sensitive to cefoxitin (85.7%). E. coli isolates were also fully susceptible to meropenem and amikacin while 75.0% of the isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$ (see Table 4). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin displayed the least activity against E. coli isolates with sensitivities of 0.0 and 12.5% respectively. Other isolates were few to make inferences as they were only a single isolate of each species. These included Serratia odorifera, Acinetobacter species, @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$, Enterobacter intermedium and Hafnia alvei. Of note, the S. odorifera was only sensitive to @sm$ levofloxacin @/sm$ and resistant to meropenem and ertapenem.	3
Among the gold, silver, @sm$ palladium @/sm$, tungsten, and other transition metal nanoparticles under research, copper nanoparticles are the least expensive. In a study by Ghuglot et al., copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were synthesized using Trigonella foenum-graecum leaf extract, and V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, and @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ were used to investigate the efficacy of biosynthesized CuNPs as an antibacterial agent.	3
Among the identified OTUs or metabolite discriminating in distinct CKD group from healthy participants, the significant associations between @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$, Clostridium, Culturomica, and Bacteroides genera and 4 NC-CKD-enriched metabolites, including Arachidic acid, L-Phenylalanine, Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and @sm$ N-Acetylputrescine @/sm$ were identified with NC-CKD occurrence (Fig.	0
Among the implicated pathways, propionate production I, @sm$ lysine @/sm$ degradation II, and anaerobic fatty acid beta-oxidation were enriched in CD compared to both UC and HC (FDR < 1E-04). The trehalose degradation and glutamate degradation III pathways were found to be depleted in HC and UC, respectively, compared to CD. Propionate production II and lactate consumption II were depleted in CD compared to HC and UC (FDR < 1E-04) (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). Interestingly, Escherichia coli was the main contributor of the three enriched pathways and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ was the main contributor of the two depleted pathways (Fig.	2
Among the metabolites pertinent to the amino acid metabolism pathway, @sm$ creatine @/sm$ was negatively correlated with Clostridium perfringens and B. longum, and glutamine was negatively correlated with Blautia and St. anginosus. In addition, glycerol was negatively related to Blautia. O-acetylcholine was positively related to Citrobacter, Serratia, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, D.	0
Among the metabolites that were determined by the CE-TOF analytical system, we observed 2-to-3-fold-increased levels of upper glycolytic intermediates such as glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) in Caco-2 cells infected by @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ POR3 and ET4 strains but not in those infected by the S1-ENM strain at 90 min postinfection (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the levels of subsequent downstream glycolytic intermediates were altered in Caco-2 cells infected with ET4 or POR3 compared to S1-ENM and the control. In those infected with strains ET4 and POR3, we found significant reductions of downstream glycolytic intermediates, including fructose 1,6-phosphate (F-1,6-P), @sm$ 3-phosphoglycerate @/sm$ (3GP), phospho(enol)pyruvic acid (PEP), and pyruvic acid (PYR) (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3), compared to Caco-2 cells infected with the S1-ENM mutant or with the control. However, we were unable to detect glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and 2-phosphoglycerate, perhaps because of their high rate of turnover or low stability. Also, the level of the end product of glycolysis, lactate, was lower in ET4-infected and POR3-infected cells than in those infected with S1-ENM or the control (P < 0.05). These data suggested that the activity of the VopQ effector of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ halted glycolytic cycles in the infected cells.	1
Among the species belonging to these families, @gm$ Gordonibacter @/gm$ spp., Eggerthella lenta, and A. equolifaciens have been identified as (poly)phenols-degrading gut bacteria. These species are known to metabolize ellagic acid and flavan-3-ols and have the capacity to cleave the C-ring of all @sm$ (epi)catechin @/sm$ stereoisomers and other derivatives.	2
Among them, @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$ was reported as a contributing factor to spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep. Further work is needed to determine whether the abundance changes in the Campylobacter genus could damage the functionality of jejunum with the presence of ruminal acidosis. Olsenella can ferment @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ into lactic acid. Olsenella spp. has also been found to break down glucose in the rumen, owing to its beta-glucosidase capacity. As shown in Kraatz et al.'s study, dietary starch increased the abundance of rumen Olsenella. Thus, the increased abundance of the Olsenella in jejunum might be the result of the higher concentration of starch in Aci group. Ruminococcus is a bacterial genus in the phylum Firmicutes and has been found in the jejunum in many studies. Ruminococcus could generate energy through @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ fermentation and produce @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$-active enzymes, such as cellulases and hemicelluloses. In this study, Ruminococcus was significantly lower in Con group. This might be due to the lower starch and more fiber in the Con group. The increased abundance of Ruminococcus in the Aci group may indicate that @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ metabolism is active.	2
Among them, susceptible to @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ was found in 7 strains, except one isolate carrying additional mutations in gyrA: D87N and parC: E84K. Only 2 point mutations were observed in parE, I444S (S. Paratyphi A) and S498T (@gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$), which were novel.	3
Amounts of SNO were slightly lower in DeltanrfA versus WT @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ but were reduced by about 80% in the DeltanarG strain (fig. S2B); @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ levels were somewhat reduced but remained at about 4 mM in DeltanarG cells (fig. S2C). Thus, the NarG nitrate reductase appears to be a major source of S-nitrosylating activity in @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ under anaerobic conditions, and S-nitrosylation is largely independent of @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ concentration per se and of @sm$ nitrite @/sm$ reduction by NrfA.	2
An analysis of 118 patients with CRC, 140 with adenomas, and 128 healthy participants revealed enrichment of Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis and depletion of Coprobacter fastidiosus, Eubacterium ventriosum, Roseburia intestinalis, and @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ in CRC compared with other groups. Moreover, the quantification of 97 metabolites showed an increase in 16 metabolites (L-alanine, glycine, @sm$ L-proline @/sm$, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid, phenyl lactic acid, oxoglutaric acid, L-phenylalanine, L-alpha-aminobutyric acid, phenylacetic acid, palmitoleic acid, 3-aminoisobutanoic acid, and norvaline), and one metabolite (butyric acid) was depleted in patients with CRC compared to healthy individuals.	0
An analysis of the spatial structure of @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$ MGL complexed with @sm$ glycine @/sm$, which models the structure of an external aldimine, suggested that the PLP-binding Lys210 provides both the 1,3-prototropic shift of the C-alpha-proton and abstraction of the C-alpha-proton.	2
An appropriate abundance of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus contributes to the maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier function and the modulation of immune homeostasis by competitive inhibition of pathogens and generation of antimicrobial compounds (e.g., bacteriocins, @sm$ lactate @/sm$, and acetate), thereby reducing the inflammation triggered by harmful intestinal bacteria. It has been demonstrated that LBP (without chemical characterization) with concentrations of 12-20 mg mL-1 significantly promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus in vitro. Similarly, LBPs mainly composed of Glc, Man, and Rha in molar ratios of 6.52:2.17:0.81 could pronouncedly improve the growth of B. bifidum, B. infantis, B. longum, @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$, L.	1
An association between the total SCFAs level and abundance level of Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ was found, whereby R. champanellensis and F. prausnitzii are present in lower abundance in the patients, with several other strains from the genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$. Desulfotomaculum guttoideum, Romboutsia ilealis, and Intestinibacter bartlettii are the microbial sp closely related to Clostridium clusters were commonly found in the NDD patients. Moreover, microbes classified under genera @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Ruminococcus cannot self-produce SCFA butyrate but can induce the production of SCFAs because of their ability to digest undigestible @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$.	2
An epidemiological and molecular investigation was performed to detect the source of infection and the virulence factors associated with @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ invasiveness in this patient. All environmental- and clinical-associated isolates were found to belong to serotype 4b and ST-219 as well as possessing actA, prfA, hlyA, and rrn virulence genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing also detected resistance to cotrimoxazole, @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$, erythromycin, and oxacillin in these isolates. Conventional and molecular surveillance of listeriosis cases, based on the systematic assessment of spatio-temporal trends, virulence genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing patterns, are key to preventing and controlling the emergence and spread of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ strains, including hypervirulent clones.	4
An inverse relationship between @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ and E. coli was also observed by Litvak and colleagues who revealed the ability of E. coli, in the presence of butyrate-producing Clostridia, to prevent @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ infection by competing for @sm$ oxygen @/sm$. While no changes in Clostridia were observed in this study, the decrease in E. coli may still reflect competition for @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ resources following @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ infection.	2
Anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides and @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ are not easily cultured by conventional techniques since require incubation chambers with nitrogen atmosphere. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus tolerate some @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ but are fastidious bacteria growing very slowly in culture media.	3
Analysis of the KL information was sufficient for serovar prediction without referring to gene loci associated with @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ biosynthesis. Nevertheless, several reports have indicated that some   A  .   pleuropneumoniae   isolates were designated as K:O serovars, including K1:O7, K2:O7, K19:O3 and K19:O4. For further detection of K:O-serovar isolates of   A  .   pleuropneumoniae  , an expanding typing pipeline can be developed with a database of biosynthesis gene loci for the outer core of @sm$ lipopolysaccharides @/sm$. Collectively, in silico KL typing can be used in retrospective studies or routine molecular typing of   A  .   pleuropneumoniae   isolates. As reported in this and previous studies, Kaptive can be applied to genotyping or genomic characterization of   Acinetobacter baumannii  ,   A  .   pleuropneumoniae  ,   @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$  ,   K.	0
Another 12 species including @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$, P. oris, and Pseudomonas fluorescens decreased sharply (Fig. S3C). Meanwhile, we also identified a total of 21 metabolic pathways, including d-galacturonate degradation, @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ fermentation to acetate and lactate, starch degradation, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, l-citrulline biosynthesis, glycogen biosynthesis, and l-isoleucine biosynthesis, to be enriched during probiotic colonization (Fig.	2
Another species that was found to be significantly increased by GOS was @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, which has been identified as a dominant butryate-producing species in a healthy human colon. @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ has been associated with maintaining intestinal metabolic balance due to its ability to utilize @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and fermentation intermediates acetate and lactate to form butyrate and hydrogen.	2
Anthocyanins did not counteract the @sm$ PCB @/sm$-mediated reduction in species richness and altered gut microbiota structure. The beta diversity data showed that the @sm$ PCBs @/sm$+ACN samples had a similar reduction in species richness and diversity as compared fecal samples exposed to @sm$ PCBs @/sm$ alone. The ACN treatment, however, did mitigate against @sm$ PCB @/sm$ perturbation of the abundance of specific taxa. ACNs suppressed @sm$ PCB @/sm$-induced overgrowth of Akkermansia, Eggerthella, and Bifidobacterium. Also, an increase in the relative abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ was observed in @sm$ PCB @/sm$ samples treated with ACNs, which is in agreement with observations of an increased relative abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ in mice treated with ACN-rich black raspberry powder. @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ are beneficial bacteria that have been implicated in promoting the gut environment by improving barrier function and controlling inflammation.	3
Antibacterial composite films were produced from carboxymethyl cellulose-gelatin (CMC-Gel) blend with different concentration of @sm$ epsilon-polylysine @/sm$ (@sm$ epsilon-PL @/sm$) and their physical and chemical properties were characterized. Compared with the control CMC-Gel film, the functionalized films had almost indistinguishable crystalline type, thickness, tensile strength, and elongation at break, however, poor water vapor barrier properties. The results showed that the @sm$ epsilon-PL @/sm$ was well incorporated into CMC-Gel matrix by electrostatic interaction, as the changes of absorption peaks in the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and the increase of glass transition temperature in differential scanning calorimeter. The films containing @sm$ epsilon-PL @/sm$ showed excellent antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli and @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$.	3
Antibiotic susceptibility of the @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ strains was conducted by the agar disk diffusion method using commercial disks (Oxoid, UK). The strains were tested for Tetracycline 30 mug, Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 25 mug, Chloramphenicol 30 mug, Ciprofloxacin 5 mug, Kanamycin 30 mug, Neomycin 30 mug, Oxytetracyclin 30 mug, Gentamicin 10 mug, Ampicillin 10 mug, Ceftriaxone 30 mug, @sm$ Aztreonam @/sm$ 30 mug, and Nalidixic acid 30 mug, and were used in this study according to the standard guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( January). The zone standards for Enterobacteriaceae were used when there were no established breakpoint interpretive criteria for @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$.	3
Arginine-dependent @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ was grown and assayed in supplemented BHI plus arginine (1% w/v). Chlorogenic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and caffeic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved directly in BHI medium, while our positive control @sm$ myricetin @/sm$ (TCI America) was dissolved in DMSO present at a final concentration of 1%. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were performed using the broth microdilution method outlined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, with some changes. Briefly, assays were performed in triplicate in round-bottom 96-well plates (Corning, Costar) in a final volume of 100 muL. Plates were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) containing 5% H2 / 10% CO2 / 85% N2 and were allowed to equilibrate for 3 h before bacteria were added. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h, with plates containing slow-growing Akkermansia muciniphila and @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ grown for 48 h.	3
As a basis for physicochemical studies on the membranes of the strictly anaerobic bacteria @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$, Anaerovibrio lipolytica, and Megasphaera elsdenii, the fatty acyl and alk-1-enyl moieties on the phosphoglycerides of these organism were characterized. Uncommon is the high proportion of a heptadecenoic acyl and alk-1-enyl moiety in these three lactate-fermenting bacteria. In contrast to @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and A. lipolytica, M. elsdenii contains high amounts of branched-chain acyl and alk-1-enyl moieties. Freeze-etching electron microscopy showed that the @sm$ lipids @/sm$ of the plasma membranes of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and A. lipolytica go from the liquid crystalline to the gel state upon lowering of the temperature, indicating that the membrane @sm$ lipids @/sm$ are predominantly in the fluid state. No @sm$ lipid @/sm$-protein segregation could be detected in the plasma membrane of M. elsdenii. This can be explained by the abundance of branched-chain fatty acyl and alk-1-enyl residues in the membranes of this organism which may prevent @sm$ lipid @/sm$-protein segregation during the @sm$ lipid @/sm$-phase transition.	3
As a negative control, we incubated the stably rough species, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, with the mouse serum; as expected this strain did not agglutinate (Figure 7A). As a second test, we assayed the ability of @sm$ acriflavine @/sm$ to agglutinate B. abortus wild-type and DeltaeipA strains. @sm$ Acriflavine @/sm$ is a molecule known to agglutinate rough strains such as @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$. After two hours of incubation, we observed no agglutination of B. abortus wild-type or DeltaeipA strains (Figure 7B). As a positive control, we treated @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ with @sm$ acriflavine @/sm$ and observed agglutination (Figure 7B).	3
As a synthesis of our observations, two main scenarios for MCs fermenting sucrose-containing media (Experiments M, ML, MLA, SLA) can be proposed: (i) The low pH of the digestive liquids (< 4) is associated with lactate and @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ as the main non-gaseous fermentation products. Under such conditions, the production of butyrate is very low. MCs are dominated with LAB (especially Lactobacillus) and lactate- and acetate-producer @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$. The contribution of Clostridium is very low. This scenario is best illustrated by Experiment M and to some extent by Experiment ML (till the 12th day). (ii) In the second scenario, illustrated by Experiments MLA and SLA, butyrate dominates among the non-gaseous fermentation products and the pH of the fermentation process is in the range 5-6. Lactate and @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ are the minor products.	2
As one of the most extensively studied glycosaminoglycan lyases, heparinase I has been used in producing low or ultra-low molecular weight @sm$ heparin @/sm$. Its' important applications are to neutralize the @sm$ heparin @/sm$ in human blood and analyze @sm$ heparin @/sm$ structure in the clinic. However, the low productivity and activity of the enzyme have greatly hindered its applications. In this study, a novel Hep-I from @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ (BcHep-I) was successfully cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a soluble protein. The molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of the enzyme are 44.42 kDa and 9.02, respectively. And the characterization of BcHep-I after purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography suggested that it is a mesophilic enzyme. BcHep-I can be activated by 1 mM Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, while severely inhibited by Zn2+, Co2+, and EDTA. The specific activity of the enzyme was 738.3 U mg-1 which is the highest activity ever reported. The Km and Vmax were calculated as 0.17 mg mL-1 and 740.58 U mg-1, respectively. Besides, the half-life of 300 min at 30 C showed BcHep-I has practical applications. Homology modeling and substrate docking revealed that Gln15, Lys74, Arg76, Lys104, Arg149, Gln208, Tyr336, Tyr342, and Lys338 were mainly involved in the substrate binding of Hep-I, and 11 hydrogen bonds were formed between @sm$ heparin @/sm$ and the enzyme. These results indicated that BcHep-I with high activity has great potential applications in the industrial production of @sm$ heparin @/sm$, especially in the clinic to neutralize @sm$ heparin @/sm$.	1
As recently detailed, the innovative synbiotics NatuREN G  comprised a mixture of @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ BLC1 (109 cells), Lacticaseibacillus casei LC4P1 (109 cells), fructo-oligosaccharides (2.5 g), inulin (2.5 g), quercetin (640 mg), resveratrol (230 mg), and proanthocyanidins (13 mg). The placebo used in the present study was exclusively based on @sm$ maltodextrins @/sm$ (500 mg) and aromas packaged in bags like those used to contain the innovative synbiotics.	2
Aside from @sm$ simvastatin @/sm$ not reducing TLR4 trafficking to lipid raft, the co-treatment with cholesterol did not recover the invasion of Brucella into macrophages which firmly confirms that the inhibition effect of @sm$ simvastatin @/sm$ on the internalization of Brucella was not a consequence of restraining cholesterol. Thus, another mechanism was considered for this inhibitory effect. Mevalonate cascade is responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis and its intermediates, such as GGPP and FPP. GGPP are the substrates for prenylation of small GTPase such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, while FPP is a substrate for prenylation of Ras, another GTPase. These GTPases regulate various phagocytic events in macrophages. It has been proven that the entry of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ into the host cell is via Rho GTPase dependent-manner and the inhibition of Rho GTPase prevents bacterial uptake. Meanwhile, the small GTPases of the Rho subfamily, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, were characterized for their roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Thereby, we hypothesize here that @sm$ simvastatin @/sm$ hampers the production of GGPP and FPP, which can affect the prenylation of GTPase, leading to the reduced phagocytosis of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$. As expected, the number of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ with GGPP- or FPP-treated cells was significantly higher than for only @sm$ simvastatin @/sm$-treated but similar to control-treated cells (Figure 3E). These findings are in agreement with the results of a previous study done by Horn et al. and indicate that @sm$ simvastatin @/sm$ inhibits the invasion of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ via the suppression of GGPP and FPP synthesis.	3
Assessment of the microbial population in blue cheese reveals that Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium glaucum, and Geotrichum candidum are three major distinguishable fungi, while Lactocococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, and @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$ can be identified in blue cheese specimens during different stages of ripening. P. roqueforti metabolites in particular show a wide range of pharmacological activity. Andrastins A, B, C, and D are consistently produced in blue-veined cheese and are potent inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, a major enzyme of @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ biosynthesis.	1
BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The signaling mechanisms for @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ lipopolysaccharide (PgLPS)-induced inflammation in human dental pulp cells are not fully clarified. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in PgLPS-induced pulpal inflammation. METHODS: Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) were challenged with PgLPS with or without pretreatment and coincubation with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (@sm$ LY294002 @/sm$). The gene or protein levels of PI3K, Akt, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin and osteonectin were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining. In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture medium. RESULTS: In response to 5 mug/ml PgLPS, IL-6, IL-8, and PI3K, but not Akt mRNA expression of HDPCs, was upregulated. IL-6, IL-8, PI3K, and p-Akt protein levels were stimulated by 10-50 mug/ml of PgLPS in HDPCs. PgLPS also induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion at concentrations higher than 5 mug/ml. Pretreatment and co-incubation by @sm$ LY294002 @/sm$ attenuated PgLPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in HDPCs. The mRNA expression of ALP, but not osteocalcin and osteonectin, was inhibited by higher concentrations of PgLPS in HDPCs. CONCLUSION: @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ contributes to pulpal inflammation in HDPCs by dysregulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to stimulate IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA/protein expression and secretion.	3
Bactericidal action of ozonated oil was further investigated and compared with 10% povidone-iodine and 0.2% @sm$ chlorhexidine @/sm$, through a disk diffusion test against Staphylococcus aureus and @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$.	3
Based on these data, the blue spectral region radiation, like that previously shown with cyan light, may act through a sensitizing effect of endogenous @sm$ porphyrins @/sm$ and flavin-type capable of inducing reactive oxygen species generation. However, @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ generally exhibited sensitivity to PBM therapy and was barely affected by blue light when grown in an anaerobiotic environment.	3
Bile salt hydrolase (BSH), which deconjugates bile acid conjugated with glycine and taurine, showed high activity in the gram-positive bacteria Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, and @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$. Clostridium scindens, @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ hylemonase, Clostridium hiranonis, and @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ are known to be intestinal microorganisms that change primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. Alcohol also affects bile acid metabolism, since it is known to stimulate the synthesis of bile acid. The pathological mechanism of this phenomenon is known to be that alcohol induces bile acid synthesis through activation of hepatic cannabinoid receptor type 1 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH). Serum-conjugated @sm$ deoxycholic acid @/sm$ (@sm$ DCA @/sm$) and elevations of total and secondary bile acid in feces were observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who continued drinking compared to patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis or alcoholic liver cirrhosis who stopped drinking. @sm$ DCA @/sm$ increased by alcohol and gut microbiota activates various cell-signaling pathways (EGFR, AKT, ERK 1/2, PKC, beta-catenin, Cox-2), leading to inflammatory NF-kappaB and proinflammatory cytokine production.	1
Biomarkers for the P group, such as Roseburia, Dorea, and @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ (Figure 6D), could generate SCFAs like acetic acid and @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$, to facilitate intestinal homeostasis.	1
Butyrivibrio species contribute to fiber digestion in both animals and humans due to their ability to degrade hemicelluloses and are also involved in protein breakdown and the biohydrogenation of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$. At present, the genus Butyrivibrio includes the rumen species Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, B. hungatei, and B. proteoclasticus and the human species @gm$ B. crossotus @/gm$, while the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio has two species, Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans and P.	1
By investigating the average scores obtained from the repeated random node removals we could identify several taxa which show higher than average importance on network stability with characteristics such as bile resistance/synthesis [e.g., Ruminococcus, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Rikenella ], quinone synthesis [e.g., Parasutterella ], or mucus/@sm$ glycan @/sm$ association [e.g., @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Rikenella, Ruminococcus; see also Supplementary Tables S11, S12]. We extended the concept of network attack to specifically test the influence of specific host characteristics by removing bacteria associated to a specific Fut2 genotype, secretor status, and breeding direction. These heuristics revealed a higher structural importance of bacteria associated to secretor genotypes, or a non-secretor grand dam. This difference in stability may be a product of mutual relationships between bacteria essential to liberate or use fucosylated ABH blood-group antigens from the mucosal surfaces, especially when we consider that several of the structurally important bacteria can be influenced by fucosylated @sm$ glycans @/sm$, e.g., Barnesiella, Lactobacillus, Odoribacter, Helicobacter, or Robinsoniella. Robustness differences associated to genotype or breeding direction may have consequences for host fitness when considering the potential for dysbiosis after environmental disturbances. A loss of key members/functions could include the loss of, e.g., @sm$ glycan @/sm$ liberation for other bacteria, or a loss of colonization resistance.	2
CBBP bacterial strains (Clostridium bolteae, @gm$ Blautia producta @/gm$, Bacteroides sartorii, Parabacteroides distasonis) were initially isolated from a mouse colony as described elsewhere. Strains were separately maintained in @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ stock at -80 C.	2
Calculated end-product yields reveal that the Caldicellulosiruptor, Pyrococcus, Thermococcus, and Thermotoga species surveyed, produced, in most cases, near-maximal H2 yields with concomitant @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ and acetate production, and little or no ethanol, formate, and lactate. It is important to note that while some studies report lower overall end-product yields, likely due to a large amount of carbon flux being directed towards biomass production under a given growth condition, H2:ethanol ratios remain high. Cal. subterraneus subsp. tengcongensis, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$, and Clostridium species displayed mixed end-product fermentation patterns, with comparatively lower H2, @sm$ CO2 @/sm$, and acetate yields, higher ethanol yields, and generally low formate and lactate yields. Ta. pseudethanolicus produced the highest ethanol yields of the organisms surveyed with little concomitant H2, acetate, and lactate production, and no formate synthesis. G. thermoglucosidasius and B. cereus produced the highest lactate and formate yields, moderate ethanol and acetate yields, and low H2 and @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ yields.	1
Campylobacter curvus and @gm$ Campylobacter hominis @/gm$ are gastric pathogens closely related to the better-known Campylobacter jejuni, whose genome was recently re-annotated. In contrast, Nitratiruptor sp. strain SB155-2 and Sulfurovum sp. strain NBC37-1 have been isolated from the deep-sea vents in the Iheya North hydrothermal field, Japan. These bacteria are chemolithoautotrophs that use @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$, sulfide, elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as electron donors and oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors.	2
Cell-free supernatants from @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ and P. uenonis were incubated with type I collagen in the presence of three doses of @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$, iodoacetamide, or aprotinin to inhibit metallo-, cysteine, and serine proteases, respectively (Fig. 3a-d and Supplementary Fig. 6). Treatment of @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ supernatants with @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ resulted in decreased collagenase activity, with a statistically significant reduction in max enzyme activity observed with the highest dose of inhibitor (Fig. 3a, c; 0.2 vs. 0.02 mM ***p = 0.0009; 0.2 vs. 0.002 mM ***p = 0.0005, and Supplementary Fig. 6). Iodoacetamide treatment revealed a trend toward a dose-dependent decrease in collagenase activity in individual experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7), but this trend was not observed when multiple experiments were combined (Fig. 3a, c and Supplementary Fig. 6). However, when @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ supernatants were treated with a combination of @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ and iodoacetamide, there was a further reduction in collagenase activity compared to @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ alone (Fig. 3a, c, **p = 0.0092). There was no statistically significant decrease in the max collagenase activity secreted by @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ with aprotinin (Fig. 3a, c and Supplementary Fig. 6). For P. uenonis, @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ also inhibited collagenase activity (Fig. 3b, d and Supplementary Fig. 6), with a significant reduction in max collagenase activity (Fig. 3d; 0.2 vs. 0.02 mM ***p = 0.0008; 0.2 vs. 0.002 mM **p = 0.0012). However, treatment with iodoacetamide or aprotinin did not reduce P. uenonis collagenase activity (Fig. 3b, d and Supplementary Fig. 6) and the combination treatment of @sm$ 1,10-phenanthroline @/sm$ and iodoacetamide did not provide an additional reduction in collagenase activity or max fluorescence (Fig. 3b, d) as observed in @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ (Fig.	3
Cells were infected at an MOI of 5 x 10-4 with GFP+ @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ pretreated with poly-d-lysine. Following 30 min of infection at 37 C, plates were washed twice with HBSS and overlaid with 1.5 ml DMEM without @sm$ phenol red @/sm$ supplement but with 5% FBS containing 25 microg/ml gentamicin, 200 U/ml IFN-gamma, 50 microg/ml carbenicillin, and 0.5% agarose.	3
Cells were spun (400 x g x 5 min) and resuspended in 500 microL RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) without @sm$ HI @/sm$-FCS. THP-1 cells were then treated with P. gingivalis, @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$, and T.	0
Co-administration of CTX and @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ had worse total anti-tumor activity than CTX monotherapy, emphasizing how essential elements of the microbiota influence the action of CTX. Further research has identified E. hirae, when translocated from the gut to the secondary lymphatic organs, increased the CD8+ T/Treg cells ratio within tumors. On the other hand, @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ does not translocate but accumulates in the colon, stimulating CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells, thus enhancing the infiltration of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing gammadeltaT cells into tumors.	4
Common prebiotics such as @sm$ inulin @/sm$ and galacto-oligosaccharide could raise the abundance of Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium species in human gut, which are immunogenic bacteria associated with improved anticancer immunity.	2
Complex @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ from human milk (HMO) possess an antimicrobial activity and can promote the growth of bifidobacteria such as Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. In addition, fermentation of carbohydrates by bifidobacteria can result in the production of metabolites presenting an antivirulence effect on several pathogenic bacteria. Whey is rich in complex bovine milk @sm$ oligosaccharides @/sm$ (BMO) structurally similar to HMO and @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$, a species of bovine origin, is able to metabolize some of those complex carbohydrates. This study focused on the ability of B. bifidum and @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ to grow in a culture medium supplemented in 3'-sialyllactose (3'SL) as the main source of carbon, a major BMO encountered in cow milk. Next, the effects of cell-free spent media (CFSM) were tested against virulence expression of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Both strains were able to grow in presence of 3'SL, but @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ showed the best growth (7.92 +- 0.3 log cfu/ml) compared to B.	2
Concurrent with the shift in microbial community structure, characterized by decreased @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ and outgrowth of Salmonella and Enterococci, we observed alterations in metabolites present in the gut, including an accumulation of sugars normally metabolized by commensal organisms. Finally, our data suggest S. Typhimurium may respond to increased fucosylated glycans in the infected gut and consume @sm$ fucose @/sm$, providing more insight into the gastrointestinal lifestyle of S.	2
Congo red was bound from solution by strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis including W50, HG189, HG184, NCTC 11834, Bg 381, WPH35, the slower brown pigmenting colonial variant W50/BR1, and the avirulent mutant W50/BE1, and by Porphyromonas endodontalis HG370 and @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ B537. SDS-PAGE of whole cells of all species examined displayed a 66 kDa Congo-red-binding component which was also detected in the outer membranes of P. gingivalis W50 grown in the chemostat under both @sm$ haemin @/sm$ limitation and @sm$ haemin @/sm$ excess, and which corresponded to a Coomassie-blue-stained band of the same mobility. Pretreatment of @sm$ haemin @/sm$-excess batch-grown cells of P.	2
Consistent with previous reports examining variation in pathways of butyrate synthesis, we identified groups of isolates that utilize butyrate kinase-dependent or butyrl-CoA transferase-dependent pathways to convert @sm$ Butyryl-CoA @/sm$ to Butyrate (Figure S4B), including some, such as Coprococcus eutactus or [Clostridium] clostridioforme with genes enabling utilization of both pathways. In addition, we identified variability in transferase-dependent pathways, with genes enabling the use of either acetate or acetoacetate, or both in the case of @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, as substrates in the reaction with @sm$ butyryl-CoA @/sm$(Figure S4B).	2
Coprococcus catus, Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus obeum, Salmonella spp., via succinate pathway, @sm$ acrylate @/sm$ pathway, and propanediol pathway (Koh et al.,). Butyrate is produced by Roseburia spp. Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium leptum, Eubacterium hallii, @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, Anaerostipes caccae, and Coprococcus catus via the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase routes and the phosphotransbutyrylase/butyrate kinase routes (Fernandez et al.,; Koh et al.,).	1
Coriander oil and its antimicrobial component @sm$ linalool @/sm$ were found to affect biofilm formation of Campylobacter planktonic cells and pre-established biofilms. When coriander and @sm$ linalool @/sm$ were used at 2 mug/mL (approximately four times the MIC) C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ biofilms were reduced in size by 70 to 80% after 48-h incubation in a crystal violet assay. Even when using half the MIC, coriander, and @sm$ linalool @/sm$ reduced the biofilm by 20 to 25%. Results of biofilm inhibition varied more wildly from planktonic cells, but all concentrations (0.025 to 2 mug/mL) successfully inhibited biofilm growth compared to the control, with @sm$ linalool @/sm$ reducing some biofilm formation between 10 and 20% of the control.	3
Correspondingly, all strains were resistant to @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ (128->128 mug/mL, Figure 1(b)) and neomycin (16->128 mug/mL, Figure 1(d)). The particular resistance of bifidobacteria to @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ is well known, and MICs between 64 and >1024 mug/mL were described for this antimicrobial agent, whereas for neomycin MICs lay between 16 and >1024 mug/mL testing a large number of species such as B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. infantis, B. longum, B. suis, @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$, and others. Using the LSM-C medium, the antimicrobial susceptibility to @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ was only tested by Kushiro et al. and Klose et al.. Whereas Kushiro et al. received MICs between 128 and 512 mug/mL for ten B. longum strains, the tested @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ strain of Klose et al. displayed an MIC value of 64 mug/mL. The lower MIC value detected by Klose et al. may be due to other testing conditions (i.e., 24 hours instead of 48 hours of incubation), underlining the importance of controlled and standardized conditions for susceptibility testing. While breakpoints for gentamicin and streptomycin are indicated in the EFSA document, none is required for @sm$ kanamycin @/sm$ or specified for neomycin.	4
DSM 10294, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ DSM 20209 were extracted using the phenol-@sm$ chloroform @/sm$ method (Stevenson and Weimer).	0
Daidzein is metabolised into @sm$ equol @/sm$ and O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) by normal flora of the gut. However, O-DMA is produced by a different group of normal flora. @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$, Slackia sp. Strain NATTS are among the colonic bacteria responsible for producing @sm$ equol @/sm$ in humans. The variations of gut microflora among individuals resulted in only 30-50% and 80-90% of the population to produce @sm$ equol @/sm$ and O-DMA, respectively.	1
Daidzein was in part degraded by @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ to @sm$ O-desmethylangolensin @/sm$, while genistein was completely degraded via 6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin to 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid. It means that the OH group in position 6' of O-DMA was crucial for its further degradation. It is interesting that dihydrogenistein was neither observed as an intermediate in this transformation nor converted itself by growing cells of @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$.	1
Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, @sm$ chrysin @/sm$ and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid.	3
Decreased abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus affects the development of @sm$ morphine @/sm$ tolerance (Kang et al.,; Zhang et al.,), and the dysbiotic @sm$ morphine @/sm$ microbiome alone can drive the development of @sm$ morphine @/sm$ tolerance (Zhang et al.,).	3
Despite the relatedness of this bacterium with Flavonifractor sp., the ability to degrade quercetin was not detected in @gm$ Intestinimonas butyriciproducens @/gm$. However, it is not known whether this bacterium can use metabolites derived from quercetin degradation, like @sm$ phloroglucinol @/sm$. In some of our incubations, the genus Coprococcus, which is reported to use @sm$ phloroglucinol @/sm$, increased in relative abundance but did not reach significance.	2
Differently, species such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, Martelella mediterranea, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$ showed positive correlation with CysC, BUN, Cr, U-Pro and CRP, and showed negative correlation with WBC, @sm$ CO2 @/sm$, HGB and ALB (Fig.	0
During an epidemiologic survey, an unidentified strain of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ was isolated from water of a thermal spa in France. The strain (Lyon 8420412) had the cultural and biochemical characteristics typical of the genus @gm$ Legionella @/gm$. In direct immunofluorescence tests, the strain reacted weakly with fluorescein-conjugated antisera prepared against L. bozemanii serogroups 1 and 2, @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$ serogroups 1 and 2 and L. anisa, and failed to react with sera prepared against 36 other species or serogroups. A fluorescein-conjugated antiserum prepared against strain Lyon 8420412 reacted strongly with the homologous strain and only weakly with the above-mentioned species. The cell-wall fatty acid profile, with a predominance of hexadecenoic (16:1) and hexadecanoic (16:0) acids, @sm$ ubiquinone Q10 @/sm$ as the major quinone and a characteristic protein electrophoresis profile suggested that the isolate was different from other @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species. In DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, the strain was distinct from all named @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species, and from all unnamed species currently under study at the Centers for Disease Control.	1
Enzymatic activities that catalyze the interconversion of purines and purine derivatives were detected in cell extracts of Spirochaeta aurantia, Spirochaeta stenostrepta, @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$, and Treponema denticola. Phosphoribosyltransferase activities present in cell extracts of each of the four spirochete species functioned in the conversion of adenine, hypoxanthine, and @sm$ guanine @/sm$ to AMP, IMP, and GMP, respectively. Nucleotidase activities in the extracts mediated the formation of nucleosides from nucleotides. The conversion of adenosine, inosine, and guanosine to the respective purine bases was catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylase and, in some instances, by nucleoside hydrolase activities. Guanine deaminase activity was found in both S. aurantia and S. stenostrepta, whereas adenosine deaminase activity was detected only in S. aurantia. Adenine deaminase activity in @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ extracts was sensitive to O2 and was relatively resistant to heating.	1
Eradication of @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ is an important objective in overcoming gastric diseases. Many regimens are currently available but none of them could achieve 100% success in eradication. Medicinal lichen is used in the treatment of gastric ulcer in local folk medicine in Anatolia (Turkey). The present study was performed to assess the in vitro effects of @sm$ usnic acid @/sm$ from Usnea dasypoga against clinical isolates and standard @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ strains and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). A total of 38 strains was assayed for anti-@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ activity. The agar dilution method was used for the determination of @sm$ usnic acid @/sm$ and clarithromycin resistance.Six (16.2%) clinical isolates were resistant to @sm$ usnic acid @/sm$ and five (13.5%) were resistant to clarithromycin. Dual susceptibility to @sm$ usnic acid @/sm$ and clarithromycin rate was detected as very high (97.3%). @sm$ Usnic acid @/sm$ has a strong and dose-dependent activity against @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ strains. The synergism between @sm$ usnic acid @/sm$ and clarithromycin may be effective in the treatment of H.	3
Eubacterium_brachy_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Desulfovibrio, @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$, Eubacterium_hallii_group and UCG-005 were negatively correlated with serum lipid metabolism (TC, @sm$ TG @/sm$, or LDL-C).	0
Exogenous TSP-1 enhances the TSP-1 secreted by HASMC stimulated by @sm$ Poly(I: C) @/sm$. The enhanced gene expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in human monocytic cells stimulated by @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ LPS. In our in vitro experiments, the expression of TSP-1 was elevated under the stimulation of LPS and @sm$ Poly(I:C) @/sm$ in tMSCs in a time-dependent manner, affirming that TSP-1 participates in tMSCs response in an inflammatory stage.	0
Fiber optic evanescent wave biosensors, in particular, have been used to detect a wide variety of molecules, including but not limited to fraction 1 antigen of @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ , Clostridium botulinum toxin A, pseudexin and ricin toxin, @sm$ trinitrotoluene @/sm$ (@sm$ TNT @/sm$),, polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, staphylococcal enterotoxin, and D-dimer.	0
Folic acid is an important substrate for the synthesis of methyl donors and as an essential @sm$ water @/sm$-soluble vitamin metabolized by the intestinal microbiome and the human body. Additional folic acid supplementation can attenuate liver injury under a high-fat diet (HFD), and ameliorate liver lipid accumulation. Thus, Parasutterella secunda, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, and Clostridium saccharogumia, which are related to FA, might be potential targets for regulating the production of FA to ameliorate fatty liver.	1
For caspase-8 assay, HKM were pre-treated with @sm$ LY83583 @/sm$, KT5823 or Z-IETD-FMK before @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$-infection. For caspase-9 assay, HKM were pre-treated with Z-ATAD-FMK, Z-IETD-FMK, CsA, RR or Z-LEHD-FMK before @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$-infection.	3
For colonization of SPF mice, 6- to 8-week-old mice were subjected to one week of antibiotic (ampicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, @sm$ neomycin @/sm$; Sigma-Aldrich) treatment in the drinking water ad libitum up to 1 day prior to gavage. Mice were then gavaged with ~5 x 109 CFU log-phase bacteria. Colonization was confirmed by @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ 16S rRNA PCR (F primer: 5'- ATGTAATGATGAGCACTCTAACGG-3'; R primer: 5'- GGCTTTTGAGATTGGCATCC-3').	3
For example, @sm$ taurocholate @/sm$ treatment increases the release of exopolysaccharides from @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ biofilms. In addition, host factors such as concentrations of bile acids and bicarbonate influence the transition between biofilm and planktonic lifestyles of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ during colonization of human intestines. Bile acid constituents have selective and distinct effects on biofilm formation in bacterial pathogens. For example, the treatment of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ biofilms with TCA or taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) reduced biofilm formation and increased dispersal of cells from the biofilms. Interestingly, in our study, @sm$ taurocholate @/sm$ also induced an increase in the number of planktonic bacterial cells (Figure 7). In a future study, we hope to investigate whether these detached bacteria might emulate the colonization process of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ and subsequently establish secondary colonies of the AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus in shrimp stomach. To further explore the mechanism by which @sm$ taurocholate @/sm$ is able to induce 5HP to form biofilm, in the future, we also hope to investigate the effect that different concentrations of @sm$ taurocholate @/sm$ may have on the morphology and motility of 5HP.	3
For example, administration of cephalexin reduces the levels of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and increases those of Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae, and six-week intravenous treatment with @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ was found to change the level of Lactobacillus.	3
For instance, @sm$ Berberine @/sm$ (isoquinoline alkaloid) found in roots/stem of Berberis species, has exhibited antibacterial activity, which can be correlated with the action of @sm$ berberine @/sm$ against DNA intercalation, RNA polymerase, gyrase /topoisomerase, as well as the inhibition of cellular division. The aminothiazolyl @sm$ berberine @/sm$ derivatives have also shown their potential antimicrobial activity against clinically resistant @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$.	3
For instance, Candida enhances the in vitro growth of the strict anaerobes @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ and Bacteroides vulgatus. The authors of this study observed similar effects when supplied spent C. albicans medium or dead C. albicans cells, which led them to postulate that carbohydrates located on the fungal surface could be fueling bacterial growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, Bacteroides spp. have been shown to harbor enzymes that are specialized in breaking down the sugar @sm$ mannan @/sm$, which is abundant on Candida's surface. The simpler sugars resulting from the @sm$ mannan @/sm$ digestion by the Bacteroides enzymes fuel the proliferation of Bacteroides.	2
For instance, SCFAs are produced from undigested carbohydrates during fermentation, of which propionate is produced mainly by phylum Bacteroidetes, Lachnospiraceae, Negativicutes, and @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ and Ruminococcus obeaum, while butyrate is produced by numerous species in the phylum Firmicutes. SCFAs regulate Treg cells' differentiation and cytokines' production, the activation of B cells, and antibody production; inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells; and enhance the antimicrobial function of macrophages. Tryptophan catabolites (such as indole, @sm$ indolepropionic acid @/sm$, and indoleacetic acid) play a role in the induction of Treg cells, CD4+ CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, and inhibition of Th17 development.	1
For instance, supplementation with black raspberry @sm$ anthocyanins @/sm$ reversed the unbalanced composition of the gut microbiota in AOM/DSS-treated mice, inhibiting the pathogenic Desulfovibrio sp. and Enterococcus spp., and restoring probiotics such as @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ and Lactobacillus, thus partly preventing the carcinogenesis.	3
For isolates of @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$, dispersive activity tended to increase with rising norspermidine concentration, with the greatest effect on biofilm inhibition following exposure to 20 mM. Importantly, for P. aeruginosa, exposure to norspermidine in some cases significantly enhanced biofilm formation (Figure 2A-B). As with the results in the preliminary screenings, the activity of norspermidine required much higher concentrations to achieve a significant effect compared to other previously characterized polyamines, @sm$ putrescine @/sm$ and spermidine. As a qualitative confirmation of the above findings, visualization of bacterial biofilms by confocal laser microscopy (CLSM) showed similar effects of norspermidine on biofilm inhibition and dispersion, with A. baumannii and @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ having the most visually significant changes in the biofilm phenotype (Figure 2C).	3
For the challenge trial, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains were incubated in BHI at 28 C for 24 hours. Yellow catfish (69.6 +- 6.8 g) were procured from a commercial farm in Wenjiang, Sichuan, China, and acclimatized at the research facility for two weeks. They were fed commercial pellets twice a weekday and maintained under a light: dark cycle of 12:12 h. Water temperature, water ammoniacal nitrogen and @sm$ nitrite @/sm$, and water pH were maintained at 23 +- 2 C, 0-0.02 mg/L, at 23 +- 2 C, and 7.0-7.5, respectively.	0
Four predicted pathways, including Wnt signalling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, TGF-beta signalling pathway and @sm$ glycosaminoglycan @/sm$ biosynthsis, are involved in Beijing/W & non-Beijing/W (Table 2) and active @gm$ MTB @/gm$& LTBI (Table 4) studies.	0
From the BSG, four xylan fractions were prepared for screening of carbon source utilization in @gm$ P. copri @/gm$: Water-extractable @sm$ AX @/sm$ (WE-@sm$ AX @/sm$), alkaline-extractable @sm$ AX @/sm$ (AE-AX), pellet @sm$ AX @/sm$ (Pellet-AX) and a combination of the three xylan fractions (WAP-@sm$ AX @/sm$) (Table I).	2
G1D30 was composed of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Peptococcus, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-004, Escherichia-Shigella, acetophenone, tyramine, putrescine, N-methylisopelletierine and N1-acetylspermine. Cluster two in G0D30 vs. G1D30 was composed of norank_f_Porphyromonadaceae, 2-monolinolenin, capsi-amide, stearoyl ethanolamide, stearamide and etretinate. Cluster three in G0D30 vs. G1D30 comprised Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Treponema_2, monolaurin, @sm$ penciclovir @/sm$, N-(5-acetamidopentyl)acetamide and glycerol 3-phosphate.	0
HMOs present an analogous pool of hundreds of complex sugars which are similar in structure to mucin @sm$ glycans @/sm$ and have fascinating bioactive properties. Because human infants lack the enzymatic capability to process HMOs, undigested oligosaccharides become the primary carbon source in the intestines. As a result, bacterial strains involved in initial colonization of the gut must utilize HMOs. Accordingly, breastfed infants have higher proportions of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, which are known to metabolize HMOs, than infants fed formula, which contains a lower abundance and diversity of oligosaccharides. Similarly, early colonization of mucosal niches may be guided by a bacterial strain's ability to forage mucin @sm$ glycans @/sm$, which include structures shared with HMOs as well as structures distinct from those in HMOs.	2
Herein this study reports the successful synthesis of a new poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), containing L-arabinose (L-arabinopyranose and arabinofuranose isomers) branched in only two steps: (1) production of polymerizable monomers of L-arabinose isomers (pyranose and furanose forms) through enzymatic synthesis using alkaline protease from @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ as catalyst and two substrates: L-arabinose and Divinyl Adipate (DVA) in @sm$ N,N-dimethylformamide @/sm$ (@sm$ DMF @/sm$); (2) radical polymerization of the monomers, using an initiator system consisting of potassium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide in water.	1
Herein, the possible impact of @sm$ pterostilbene @/sm$ (@sm$ PSB @/sm$) and resveratrol (RES) on the gut microbiota brought by chronic jet-lag in mice is investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dietary supplement of RES and @sm$ PSB @/sm$ (0.25%) are given to 16 week-jetlagged mice to examine the effects on microbiota and physiological functions. Jetlag significantly induces weight gained that could be effectively prevented by @sm$ PSB @/sm$. Both supplements also retain oscillation patterns that found to be lost in jetlag induced (JLG) group, including serum biochemical parameters and gut microbiota. The results of beta diversity suggest the supplementations efficiently lead to distinct gut microbial composition as compared to JLG group. Besides, the supplementation forestalls some microbial elevation, such as @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ and Acetitomaculum. Growth of health beneficial bacteria like Blautia and Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 is facilitated and abundance of these bacteria could be correlated to oscillation of biochemical parameters. Result of KEGG indicates distinct effect brought by microbial re-shaping. CONCLUSION: The result suggests that supplementation of RES and @sm$ PSB @/sm$ could potentially dampen some adverse effects of gut microbiota dysbiosis, and at the same time, re-composite and facilitate the growth of health beneficial microbiota.	3
However, about 30% of subjects convert daidzein to @sm$ (S)-equol @/sm$ via dihydrodaidzein and tetrahydrodaidzein resulting from the activities of a wide range of organisms including Streptococcus intermedius, @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$, Ruminococcus productus, Eggerthella sp.	1
However, the MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were not able to distinguish between Mycobacterium marinum and @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ because of their close genetic relationship. Photochromogenicity testing can help differentiate between these species based on the alteration in colony color after light exposure. For our patient, the colonies turned yellow after 18h of incubation in the sun, identifying the species as M. marinum. Besides surgical drainage, the patient received @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$ and clarithromycin for three months, and her symptoms resolved without relapse after six months of follow-up.	3
In @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$, as well as in many other @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species, the EIIANtr component is missing. However, we found that deletion mutations in both ptsP and ptsO are partially attenuated for intracellular growth. Furthermore, these two PTSNtr components were found to be required for maximal expression of effector-encoding genes regulated by the transcriptional activator PmrA. Genetic analyses which include the construction of single and double deletion mutants and overexpression of wild-type and mutated forms of EINtr, NPr, and PmrA indicated that the PTSNtr components affect the expression of PmrA-regulated genes via PmrA and independently from PmrB and that EINtr and NPr are part of the same cascade and require their conserved histidine residues in order to function. Furthermore, expression of the Legionella micdadei EIINtr component in @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ resulted in a reduction in the levels of expression of PmrA-regulated genes which was completely dependent on the @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ PTS components and the L. micdadei EIINtr conserved histidine residue. Moreover, reconstruction of the @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ PTS in vitro indicated that EINtr is phosphorylated by @sm$ phosphoenolpyruvate @/sm$ (@sm$ PEP @/sm$) and transfers its phosphate to NPr. Our results demonstrate that the @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ incomplete PTSNtr is functional and involved in the expression of effector-encoding genes regulated by PmrA.	2
In addition to Salmonella, @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ responds to physicochemical stresses in cut lettuce and lettuce lysates by upregulation of several stress response pathways. Damaged lettuce leaf tissue supplied E. coli with substrates for proliferation, and also provides pathogenic bacteria with @sm$ choline @/sm$ for osmotic protection (Scott et al.).	2
In addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. Porphyromonas gingivalis, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus and Campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (DrySlide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. Isolates from the @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. Based on the non-selective plates, six of 23 @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ isolates, 2 of 19 B. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 F. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. The beta-lactamase positive species Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella buccalis and Actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective @sm$ amoxicillin @/sm$ plates.	4
In addition to using cDNA to lock the initial aptamer conformation and designing the stem-loop aptabeacon, a nanomaterial, such as @sm$ graphene oxide @/sm$ (GO), is intensively used as the a nanoscaffold to adsorb ssDNA probes. GO, a two-dimensional carbon material, has attracted considerable attention owing to its prominent physical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties. GO that can be used to build aptasensors is based on these three main properties. First, GO has a large surface area for binding nucleic acids via pi-stacking interactions or chemical modifications; second, GO can act as a superb quencher through FRET experiments because of its broad absorption spectrum and high quenching efficiency; finally, GO can protect nucleic acids that bind to its surface from being cleaved by nucleases in a biological environment. Tan et al. designed aptasensor for the analysis of chloramphenicol (CAP), which is based on double signal amplification and GO as an efficient fluorescence quencher. In this method, a nucleic acid probe containing two FAM-labeled signal probes (SPs) and a capture probe (CP) was adsorbed onto the surface of GO via pi-stacking interactions without the CAP. This adsorption results in the quenching of the fluorescence of the label. Upon addition of CAP, the fluorescence was restored because the aptamer/CAP complexes were formed, which led to the FAM being away from GO (Fig. 7 A). Using a dye-labeled probe/GO quenching model, various targets, including IgE, aflatoxin B-1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, have been successfully detected. Ning et al. fabricated a label-free fluorescent aptasensor for the determination of ATP. This aptasensor was composed of unbound SYBR Green I, @sm$ graphene oxide @/sm$, and a label-free detection probe.	0
In addition, @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ amplified its cytotoxicity against murine macrophages and also together with @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$, can trigger @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ virulence that affect human epithelial cell viability. Collectively and complementary, our results illustrate how @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ can overcome the stress imposed in a hostile environment, not only using bacterial metabolic strategies but also changing the expression of genes associated with pathogenicity and adaptative response to stress to persist and survive. Since a considerable number of genes are affected in the presence of PF, we believe that a multifactorial strategy might be involved in scenarios containing stressors and detrimental conditions that lead to @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ adaptation and success in extreme conditions.	2
In addition, among the metabolites, glycocholate, 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, @sm$ xylitol @/sm$, and urocanic acid were significantly positively correlated with IL-1beta, while d-maltose, daidzein, folate, maltotriose, d-lactose, l-sucrose, and others were significantly negatively correlated with IL-1beta. Some differential bacteria, such as Akkermansia, islandicum, @gm$ Alistipes, indistinctus @/gm$, intestinihominis, and Succinispira mobilis, were also significantly correlated with many metabolites, as shown in Figure 6.	1
In addition, intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides helcogenes, Bacteroides salanitronis, Bacteroides vulgatus, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$, Prevotella dentalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Parabacteroides distasonis, and Alistipes finegoldii were also suggested to possess the similar metabolic pathway for N-glycans. A notable feature of the new metabolic pathway for N-glycans is the more efficient use of @sm$ ATP @/sm$-stored energy, in comparison with the conventional pathway where beta-mannosidase and @sm$ ATP @/sm$-dependent hexokinase participate, because it is possible to directly phosphorylate the D-mannose residue of beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to enter glycolysis.	2
In addition, the decreased levels of Prevotella copri, Prevotella stercorea, and @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$ also determine short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. SCFAs play an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial role in various interactions between gut microbiome and host metabolism. Additionally, microbial metabolites can affect central neurotransmitters by activating afferent nerve fibers. SCFAs can stimulate the release of central neurotransmitters (including 5-HT) in the intestine. Bifidobacterium is a key member of the human gut microbiota affecting @sm$ GABA @/sm$ production.	1
In an exploratory analysis (Figure 3), we found that those with higher 2T @sm$ Pb @/sm$ concentration (>= 2.6 ug/dL, i.e., the study median) had higher odds (OR=2.61, 95%CIs:[1.06, 6.45]) of having a below-median relative abundance of the 2-taxa clique (B. adolescentis and @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$). Similarly, those with 2T @sm$ Pb @/sm$ concentration at or above the United States guideline for child Pb poisoning (>= 3.5 ug/dL) and the Mexican guideline (>= 5 ug/dL) had higher odds (OR=3.36, 95%CIs:[1.32, 8.51] and OR=6.11, 95%CIs:[1.87, 19.93] respectively) of having a below-median relative abundance of the same 2-taxa clique. There is an increasing trend in the odds of below-median relative abundance of the two taxa clique, as the 2T @sm$ Pb @/sm$ concentration cutoff threshold increases. In other words, children whose mothers had increased 2T @sm$ Pb @/sm$ concentration, including levels below the US and Mexico guidelines for child Pb poisoning, have increased odds of having a low abundance of the 2-taxa clique late in childhood.	3
In contrast, Apoe-/- mice had an approximately doubled atherosclerotic burden and elevated plasma levels of @sm$ TMA @/sm$ and TMAO. And another study showed by 16S rRNA sequencing that Apoe-/- mice fed a high choline diet had a 44.2% higher burden of atherosclerosis than mice with @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$.	0
In experiment LP, the intermediate metabolites from co-culture degradation of @sm$ deltamethrin @/sm$ were 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (B), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic butyl dacyl ester (C), and phenol (D) within 72 h. A new peak with retention time 6.525 min was observed and was identified as phenol, which was not detected in experiment L (monoculture strain LH-1-1). The formation of phenol may be due to the oxidization and cleavage of diaryl ether of 3-PBA by the strain BPBA052 (Tang et al.). Along with metabolization, no persistent accumulative product was detected, the results showed that @sm$ deltamethrin @/sm$ and its intermediate metabolites were degraded and completely mineralized by co-culture. Based on the chemical structures of @sm$ deltamethrin @/sm$ and the identified metabolites, a microbial metabolic pathway of @sm$ deltamethrin @/sm$ by co-culture of strains @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ LH-1-1 and K. pneumoniae BPBA052 was proposed (Fig. 6). Firstly, @sm$ deltamethrin @/sm$ (A) was hydrolyzed to yield 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (B) and (1R, cis)-3-(2,2-dibromoethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid by strain LH-1-1.	1
In healthy adults, the GFD associated with a reduced intake of complex @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ caused shifts in gut microbiota composition. Particularly, there were decreases in Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium lituseburense group, Fecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium longum after adherence to a GFD, whereas Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae and @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$ numbers increased.	2
In humans, @gm$ S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus @/gm$ is isolated from urine in urinary tract infections and S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus from blood in cases of endocarditis. Both of these subspecies inhabiting the human digestive tract also have a clear, widely documented relationship with the formation of cancer of the bile ducts and large intestine. Among the strains of this complex, a worrying increase in antibiotic resistance, including @sm$ penicillin G @/sm$ and vancomycin, is observed.	4
In ingredient analysis, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified the main components of essential oil as @sm$ methyl eugenol @/sm$ (45.95%), safrole (17.48%) and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (10.30%) orderly. In vitro, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of essential oil were 0.01 and 0.02% against F. nucleatum, 0.04 and 0.08% against @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$, and 0.005 and 0.005% against P.	3
In line with several studies that reported lower faecal Bifidobacteria abundance in children with ASD compared to neurotypical children, we also identified an ASV annotated as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ that was decreased in ASD cases compared to controls. One of the plausible pathways explaining the involvement of gut bacterial imbalance in ASD is metabolism. In a study, germ-free mice received human faecal microbiota transplantation using samples from either children with ASD or typically-developed children. The results showed alterations in @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolism, and Bifidobacteria changes correlated with differently abundant metabolites from derivatives of @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolisms. Furthermore, dietary interventions either with @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains or other bacterial strains and/or compounds that increase Bifidobacteria levels in the gut have shown to improve, not only intestinal outcomes, but also ASD severity.	2
In order to further study the effects of @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ and air on the gut microbiota, LEfSe analysis was performed to search for differential biomarkers, and identified eight significantly different species and two different genera between the two groups. Within 14 days after colonoscopy, @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$, Bacteroides finegoldii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Subdoligranulum and Lachnospiraceae, which were all obligate anaerobes, in the @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ group, were significantly higher compared with that in the air group. On the other hand, Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus torques and Ruminococcus guavus in the air group were significantly higher than that in the @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ group (Figure 5). Although there were more Prevotella Stercorea and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the air group than in the @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ group before colonoscopy, there was no difference between the two groups after colonoscopy (Figure 5). These results suggested that @sm$ CO2 @/sm$ was more conducive to the growth of obligate anaerobes during colonoscopy than air.	3
In recent years, it has been discovered that @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-based amino acids lead to competitive inhibition with that of butyrate. Sulfurous amino acids are fermented by such bacterial classes/families as Clostridia, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Lachnospiraceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae, which produce hydrogen sulfide as a metabolite. (It should be noted that, to date, only in-vitro experimentation has been performed in this area, and therefore more research is required to confirm this aspect). In turn, hydrogen sulfide inhibits the bacteria from producing the anti-inflammatory butyrate compound. Therefore, perhaps, a recipe for low inflammation is as follows: a large proportion of butyrate-producing bacteria in combination with a low proportion of available @sm$ sulfur @/sm$-based amino acids.	2
In strain LCH30 complemented with either NgAas, AfAas1 or AfAas2, the majority of the [d3]12:0 was elongated prior to incorporation into @sm$ phospholipid @/sm$. An example spectrum from cells expressing AfAas1 illustrates the incorporation pattern that was similar for all three acyl-ACP synthetases (Fig. 9D). The fragmentation pattern of the (+6)30:0 PE molecular species showed the presence of [d3]16:0 and [d3]14:0 (Fig. 9D, inset), confirming the elongation of [d3]12:0. Also, the (+6)32:0 peak composed of two 16:0 fatty acids can only arise from the elongation of [d3]12:0. These data established the existence of two acyl-ACP synthetases in @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$.	1
In swabs a large number of unusual gram-negative bacteria species were isolated, such as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas fulva, Pseudomonas moselii, Aeromonas veronii, @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinteobacter guilloviae, Acinteobacter lowffii; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Acinteobacter tjernbergae; Pantoea agglomerans; Pantoea calida. Among isolates, strains resistant to @sm$ carbapenems @/sm$, ESBL producers and methicillin resistant were found.	4
In that study, suckling piglets were fed a diet rich in fiber, particularly alfalfa which is rich in insoluble fiber (cellulose) but also has soluble fibers including fructans and @sm$ pectins @/sm$. They hypothesized that a moderate addition of dietary fiber during the suckling period may affect the gut microbiota. Interestingly, results from their study showed that a diet rich in alfalfa decreased the abundance of Streptococcus suis, a known pathogen that induces bacterial mortality of piglets after weaning. In addition, the diet containing alfalfa increased the abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$ in the distal colon at weaning. @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$ belongs to the Clostridium group with butyrate-producing ability.	2
In the case of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$, the known antibiotic GEN showed strong antibacterial activity (inhibition zone of 20.66 +- 0.577 mm), while @sm$ neomycin @/sm$ (NEO) was almost inactive. Interestingly, a better activity was observed by the combination of M-F with any of the antibiotics GEN and NEO (inhibition zone of 30.66 +- 1.527 and 21.0 +- 1.00 mm, respectively) (Figure 3 and Table 2). The lowest zones of inhibition were observed for TE or DCM-F (inhibition zone of 9.66 +- 0.577 and 7.66 +- 0.577 mm, respectively). @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ was sensitive to MW-F, M-F, and GEN, and a synergistic antibacterial effect of their combination was evident (Table 2).	4
In the co-occurrence network, we found that the neighbors of Flavonifractor, such as Pseudoflavonifractor and @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$, were able to hydrolyze aesculin (similar to flavonoid glycosides in molecular structure) into glucose and @sm$ aesculetin @/sm$.	1
In the current study, a total two of completely sequenced genomes of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ were retrieved from NCBI. The MS-17-188 is a multi-drug resistant strain recovered from catfish in 2017. This strain is responsible for gastrointestinal tract infections and is resistant to chloramphenicol, doxycycline, gentamicin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, novobiocin, @sm$ florfenicol @/sm$, streptomycin, azithromycin, and spectinomycin.	4
In the present study, children treated in the PICU showed significant changes in C-reactive protein, calcitonin, white blood cells, platelets, @sm$ creatinine @/sm$, and lactate levels. In addition, the relative abundance of colonies such as Bacilli, Lactobacillales, and @gm$ Campylobacter hominis @/gm$ changed significantly.	0
In this study, many short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers such as Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ were significantly enhanced in the day 0 group. Interestingly, Prevotella, which is better equipped to consume plant-derived @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, was markedly depleted in TB patients, while the abundance of Bacteroides was increased (Maji et al.,).	2
In total, 37 different bacterial species were isolated, and the major isolates included @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ (7.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%), Shigella spp. (14.2%), Yersinia enterocolitica (6.7%), and Pseudomonas spp. (16.3%). No Vibrio cholerae could be isolated; however, V. fluvialis was isolated from three water samples. The isolated organisms were highly resistant to @sm$ cefazolin @/sm$ (83.5%), cefoxitin (69.2%), ampicillin (66.4%), and cefuroxime (66.2%).	4
In vitro antimicrobial activity of @sm$ fleroxacin @/sm$ (6,8- difluoro-1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1, 4-dihydro-7-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid) and ofloxacin against representative pathogenic mycobacteria was evaluated by the agar dilution method, using 7H11 agar medium. @sm$ Fleroxacin @/sm$ showed appreciable antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90 = 6.25 mg/l), M. kansasii (MIC90 = 3.13 mg/l), and M. fortuitum (MIC90 = 6.25 mg/l), whereas M. marinum, @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$, M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chelonae were highly resistant to the agent. The activity of @sm$ fleroxacin @/sm$ was comparable to that of ofloxacin. @sm$ Fleroxacin @/sm$ showed antimicrobial activity against M. intracellulare phagocytosed in murine peritoneal macrophages at a concentration of 10 mg/l in the culture medium, but its activity was considerably lower than that of ofloxacin. On the other hand, the therapeutic activity of @sm$ fleroxacin @/sm$ against M. fortuitum infection induced in mice was higher than that of ofloxacin. Neither @sm$ fleroxacin @/sm$ nor ofloxacin was efficacious against M. intracellulare infection. @sm$ Fleroxacin @/sm$ significantly depressed the growth of M.	4
In vitro, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ 513 uses PpdK and PckA for @sm$ phosphoenolpyruvate @/sm$ synthesis while B. abortus 2308W depends only on PpdK. This is likely to reflect the situation in vivo, because PpdK dysfunction causes attenuation of B. abortus 2308W in mice but not in @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ 513, in which attenuation occurred only in the double pckA-ppdK mutant. Although these observations strongly suggest that PckA is not essential for multiplication in the host and that, accordingly, it was not positively selected during evolution, we cannot presently extend this hypothesis to all core brucellae. On one hand, the genomes of all B. abortus and B. melitensis sequenced strains show the same pckA frameshift and subsequent stop codon that results in a truncated protein of 491 amino acids, and this is also true of the only B. ovis strain (BOV_2009 strain) sequenced. On the other, the pckA homologs of @gm$ B. suis biovar @/gm$ 3 (strain 686), 4 (strain 40), or 5 (strain 513), B.	1
Increased adsorption of bacHV219 to @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ HKLHS was detected in the presence of Triton X-100, beta-mercapto-ethanol, chloroform, NaCl, KH2PO4 and MgCl2. Adsorption of bacHV219 to E. faecalis E88 increased in the presence of Na-acetate, Na2CO3, Triton X-100, 80% ethanol, methanol, K2HPO4, KH2PO4, MgCl2, @sm$ KCl @/sm$, Tris and NH4-citrate.	3
Initially isolated from the carnation wilt pathogen Trinickia caryophylli (formerly assigned to the genera Pseudomonas, @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$, and Paraburkholderia), this toxic @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ metabolite is also produced by @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ strains, including a mushroom pathogen and a beetle symbiont that protects the insect eggs from entomopathogenic fungi.	1
Interestingly, @sm$ equol @/sm$, the isoflavone derivative with the greatest estrogenic and antioxidant activity, is only found in one third to one half of humans (thus, only in those harboring @sm$ equol @/sm$-producing microbes). The isoflavone daidzein found exclusively in soya beans and other legumes and can be converted to @sm$ equol @/sm$ by several bacterial species including Slackia, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Paraeggerthella, Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella sp. among others. While the effects of bacterially activated phytoestrogens on receptor positive BC are not yet agreed upon; a recent TNBC clinical trial, comprising 39 patients with invasive TNBC, established that a course of oral @sm$ S-equol @/sm$ inhibited proliferation of breast tumor cells, as measured by the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, with a 20% decrease in Ki-67 expression in almost one third of patients.	1
Intriguingly, Bacteroidetes were differentiated by their consumption of most of the glutamine (Gln; median consumption 83%) and @sm$ asparagine @/sm$ (@sm$ Asn @/sm$; median consumption 96%) in the mega medium (Fig. 3b). Classic work showing Bacteroides could not use free AAs as sole nitrogen sources (NS) failed to test @sm$ Asn @/sm$ and Gln. Based on the data from the 60 Bacteroidetes taxa in the collection, we hypothesized that Gln and @sm$ Asn @/sm$ might serve as sole NS. To test this, we grew all 60 Bacteroides and @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ species in a minimal medium that lacked free ammonium, but contained 10 mM Glutamate (Glu), Gln, or @sm$ Asn @/sm$. Strikingly, the @sm$ Asn @/sm$ or Gln sufficed as the NS for 50 of 60 Bacteroidetes tested (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). To determine the genetic basis of @sm$ Asn @/sm$ utilization, we searched the Bacteroidetes genomes for homologs of E. coli enzymes that consume @sm$ asparagine @/sm$ and release ammonia (Fig. 3c, red rows). For taxa with available genomes, an L-asparaginase II homolog (ansB; > 59% identity) strongly correlated (Pearson r = 0.91) with max OD when grown on @sm$ Asn @/sm$. Using a transposon mutant in the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron type strain (Bt VPI 5482 2757-3983-), we confirmed that this L-asparaginase II homolog was necessary for growth with @sm$ Asn @/sm$ as a sole NS (Fig. 3d). The effect we observed was not dependent on presence of cysteine; Bt VPI 5482 and Bt VPI 5482 2757-3983- grew with sodium sulfide substituted as reduced sulfur source and the pattern of growth was maintained (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We next examined Bacteroides amino acid consumption patterns in vivo. In the cecum of mice monocolonized with Bt VPI 5482, @sm$ Asn @/sm$ was the most depleted AA (median decrease of 86.9%) compared to germ-free control animals (Extended Data Fig. 8e). This observation is consistent with in vivo @sm$ Asn @/sm$ utilization by Bt, but does not exclude colonization-dependent changes in host @sm$ Asn @/sm$ utilization.	2
Isolation C showed similarity of 99.79% with @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ (CP037424). In the next steps, these three 16S rRNA sequences were aligned with other sequences of different species in GenBank database. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. The similar results were found in phylogenetic analysis (Figure 7). These endobacteria were also found in other insects. @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ group was reported to be the major endobacteria in other insects. @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ is a common endosymbiont in insect. Therefore, in our present study, isolation C @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ was chosen to initially analyze the potential antibacterial activity of @sm$ geraniol @/sm$. The results showed that @sm$ geraniol @/sm$ could inhibit the isolation C growth in vitro. The @sm$ geraniol @/sm$ concentration of 500 mug/mL inhibited the isolation C growth in LB medium effectively according to the OD600 analysis (Table 1).	3
It was found that our flux-based model fitted best when 42% of the glucose was converted through the @sm$ acetate @/sm$-butyrate pathway involving electron bifurcation (Table S5). The microbial community was populated by two genera from the class of Clostridia: an @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ population and Clostridium population. The @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ population showed dominance, as Ruminococcaceae were dominant while Clostridium was a minority which was shown with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (Figure 3f,g). @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$ is a strictly anaerobic species known to produce ethanol, @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and butyrate from carbohydrates (Tang, Yuan, Guo, & Ren, 2012; Xing et al., 2006). Cluster 12 (sensu strcito XII) of Clostridium was identified (Figure 3a,f). Clostridium pasteurianum is a well-studied species in this cluster (SILVA release 138), and is known for @sm$ acetate @/sm$-butyrate production involving electron bifurcation (Buckel & Thauer, 2013). This organism has also been found in a fermentative granular enrichment culture which stored poly-glucose (Tamis, Joosse, Loosdrecht, & Kleerebezem, 2015). In a glucose-fermenting methanogenic community, storage of glucose has been characterised as the storage of mainly trehalose (Shimada, Zilles, Raskin, & Morgenroth, 2007). In the mineral medium enrichment, effectively 20% of the glucose was potentially metabolised via a carbon storage pool (Figure S6A). As the community is dominated by @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ and the storage of poly-glucose is significant it is likely that both Clostridium and @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ species were performing the storage response.	1
KBP-7072 (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/liter; 100.0% inhibited at <=0.5 mg/liter) was active against 12 @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ isolates (Tables 1 and). Based on @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ MIC90 values, KBP-7072 (MIC90, 0.5 mg/liter) was comparable in activity to tigecycline (MIC90, 0.5 mg/liter), 2-fold more active than tetracycline (MIC90, 1 mg/liter; 91.7% susceptible), and 4-fold more active than doxycycline (MIC90, 2 mg/liter), @sm$ minocycline @/sm$ (MIC90, 2 mg/liter), and omadacycline (MIC90, 2 mg/liter; 100.0% susceptible) (Table 3).	3
Kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster XIVa colon bacteria grown on acetate plus @sm$ fructose @/sm$, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. A gas chromatography method was set up to assess H2 and CO2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. Method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. Fermentations with Anaerostipes caccae DSM 14662(T), Roseburia faecis DSM 16840(T), @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$ @gm$ DSM 16839 @/gm$(T), and Roseburia intestinalis DSM 14610(T) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, CO2, and H2 as the main metabolites. R. faecis DSM 16840(T) and R. intestinalis DSM 14610(T) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. Lactate consumption was only observed with A. caccae DSM 14662(T). Roseburia inulinivorans DSM 16841(T) was the only strain included in the present study that was able to grow on @sm$ fructose @/sm$, oligofructose, and inulin.	2
Lactobacillus salivarius or Pediococcus pentosaceus prevented D-galactosamine-induced rat liver injury as evidenced by reduced total @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ as well as colon and liver abnormalities, decreased bacterial translocation and increased IL-10. Moreover, Pediococcus pentoseceus, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, and Lactobacillus paracasei 19 inhibited bacterial translocation after liver resection in rats, and induced hepatocyte mitosis which was delayed by colonic anastomosis.	1
Landmark studies in the 2000s demonstrated that the microbiota contributes to digestion, carbohydrate metabolism, obesity, and plasma @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels. Additionally, those studies established a causal relationship by showing that the susceptibility to obesity could be transferred between mice when the fecal microbiota of obese mice was transplanted into non-obese animals. Consistent with these findings, several other studies have reported enrichment or depletion of specific obesity-related gut bacteria and indicated a connection between gut microbiota, adiposity, and T2D. For example, increased abundance of Prevotella and decreased abundance of Bacteroides were associated with a higher risk of obesity with metabolic syndrome, while body mass index and body fat percentage were negatively correlated with @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ abundance. More recent data suggests that the abundance of a bacteria in the Bacilli family was positively associated with fat mass, and negatively associated with lean mass and plasma @sm$ glucose @/sm$ level. Additionally, Peptostreptococcaceae, Blautia, and a bacterium related to the Clostridiaceae family were positively associated with plasma @sm$ glucose @/sm$ levels.	3
Levofloxacin possesses a wide antimicrobial spectrum which encompasses Gram positive (also including @sm$ penicillin @/sm$-resistant @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$) and Gram negative, and atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) as well.	4
Likewise, the genome of @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ also underwent genome reduction (7.7%), where the most important traits of the mutant NKU421 strain comprise a boosted intracellular ratio of @sm$ ATP @/sm$/ADP, 2-fold enhancement in mcl-PHA synthesis (Table 1), and 28% increase in oligosaccharides (Fan et al., ). Somehow the genes removed from the genome of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ boosted transcription levels of PHA-related genes, especially the PHA polymerases.	1
METHOD: We used the Smartongue, to determine the composition informations of the liquid culture samples and combined with soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA) to analyze their respective species, then set up a Smartongue -SIMCA model to discriminate the @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$. RESULTS: The Smartongue has 6 working electrodes and three frequency segments, we can built 18 discrimination models in one detection. After comparing all the 18 discrimination models, the optimal working electrodes and frequency segments were selected out, they were: @sm$ palladium @/sm$ electrode in 1 Hz frequency segment, tungsten electrode in 100 Hz and silver electrode in 100 Hz. Then 10 species of pathogenic Vibrio were discriminated by the 3 models. The V. damsela, V. metschnikovii, V. alginalyticus, V. cincinnatiensis, V. metschnikovii and V. cholerae O serogroup samples could be discriminated by the SIMCA model of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ with @sm$ palladium @/sm$ electrode 1 Hz frequency segment; V. mimicus and V. vulnincus samples could be discriminated by the SIMCA model of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ with tungsten electrode 100 Hz frequency segment; V. carcariae and V. cholerae non-O serogroup samples could be discriminated with the SIMCA model of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ in silver electrode 100 Hz frequency segment. The accurate discrimination of ten species of Vibrio samples is 100%. CONCLUSION: The Smartongue combined with SIMCA can discriminate @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ with other pathogenic Vibrio effectively. It has a promising future as a new rapid detection method for @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$.	0
METHODS: Water and @sm$ methanol @/sm$ extracts of V. negundo leaves were evaluated against enteric bacterial pathogens by using standard disc diffusion, viable bacterial cell count methods, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). RESULTS: Methanol extract of V. negundo leaves showed potent antibacterial activity (inhibition zone: 9.9-22.6 mm, MIC: 200-3200 mug/mL, MBC: 200-6400 mug/mL) against all the pathogenic enteric bacteria (Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$, Echerichia coli, Shigella spps., and Aeromonas spps) tested.	3
MGIVflInd1, initially isolated from @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$, was used as a prototype to study MGIs and was reported to be mobilized at high frequency between E. coli strains by both ICEVflInd1 and SXT (10-3 transconjugants per donor cell). This frequency rose to 10-1 transconjugants per donor cell upon overexpression of setCD or induction with @sm$ mitomycin C @/sm$ treatment.	3
MIC(90) values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ and one isolate of Fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (CLSI breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. Two isolates of the capnophilic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. Comparison with a previous study from The Netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the MIC(90) values of A. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$ were higher.	4
Mass-spectrometric analysis of native @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ glycoproteins after subjection to beta-elimination revealed the glycan to be an oligosaccharide consisting of nine sugar residues (Fig. 18). Notably, the proposed structure resembles that of the T. forsythia O-glycan in several aspects. In both glycans, attachment to the protein occurs via a hexose residue that is succeeded by a @sm$ hexuronic acid @/sm$. Additionally, a nonpolar constituent branches from the first sugar of the @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ O-glycan. Also, both glycans contain a deoxyhexose residue in their linear structure. As in the T. forsythia glycan, the deoxyhexose of the @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ glycan most likely is a fucose residue, as glycoproteins of @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ are readily detected with Aleuria aurantia lectin and depend on genes for GDP-fucose biosynthesis.	1
Materials used in this research included the following: biotinylated goat anti-@gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ antibody (used as capture antibody; 1 ng/nL, or diluted as indicated throughout), and @sm$ fluorescein @/sm$-labeled goat anti-@gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ antibody (used as reporter antibody; 0.5 ng/nL), from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD); biotinylated @sm$ fluorescein @/sm$ conjugate (1 ng/nL) from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA); biotin-labeled bovine albumin (1 mug/muL), streptavidin (0.2 mug/muL), PBS tablets, glycerol, Trizma  base, and bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); Superfrost  Gold electrostatically-coated microscope slides and LifterSlip  m series microarray coverslips (22 mm x 50 mm) from Erie Scientific Company (Portsmouth, NH); PAP hydrophobic barrier pens from BioGenex Laboratories (San Ramon, CA); @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ B1409 from Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA); and EC medium from DIFCO Laboratories (Detroit, MI).	0
Metronidazole and @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ reduction activities were measured in situ in the micro-aerophilic bacteria @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ and Helicobacter pylori employing 14N- and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The properties of these enzyme activities were investigated in matched pairs of strains with sensitive and resistant phenotypes to the antimicrobial metronidazole. The results indicated that the ability of each type of strain to reduce metronidazole corresponded to its sensitive or resistance phenotype. Higher levels of @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ reduction and a significantly lower Ki for metronidazole were observed in sensitive strains compared to resistant strains. These findings suggested a relationship between the cellular machinery regulating intracellular redox status in @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ and H.	3
Mice pretreated with @sm$ water @/sm$/CS for 5 days, and then received 3% DSS for 5 days to induce UC. On the 11th day of the experiment, Lactobacillus johnsonii (band d) was found in all groups (D11-Group 1-4). But the intensities of Blautia sp. (band c) and Lactobacillus ruminis (band e) weakened in the DSS-alone treatment group (D11-Group 2). Especially, Blautia sp. (band c) almost disappeared in the DSS-alone treatment group, but this band existed in both CSH and CSL pretreated groups. The intensity of Blautia sp. (band c) in the CSH group (D11-Group 3) was stronger than that in CSL group (D11-Group 4). In addition, Parabacteroides distasonis (band a) and Prevotella intermedia (band f) existed in all DSS-treated groups, but did not exist in the control group. On the 15th day of the experiment, the mice had stopped taking DSS and continued to receive @sm$ water @/sm$/CS for 5 days. Blautia sp. (band c) still decreased in the DSS-alone treatment group, almost disappearing. Parabacteroides distasonis (band a) did not exist in all groups. Other bands had no significant change at different time intervals (D11 and D15). The bacterium from the genera of Parabacteroides, Blautia, Lactobacillus, and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ were dominant organisms in the intestinal tract of mice.	0
Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a microplate method for 245 strains and agar dilution for 33 @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$ strains. Tested strains were as follows: 85 Bacteroides fragilis, 71 Clostridium, 19 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 35 Peptostreptococcus, 39 Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius and 33 @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$. Tested antibiotics were: metronidazole, @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$, minocycline, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, keflin and carbenicillin. For Bacteroides fragilis, the three most active antibiotics were metronidazole (inhibition of all strains with 8 micrograms/ml), minocycline and @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$ (inhibition of 95% of strains by MICs less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). However, four strains were resistant to @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$ (MICs greater than 8 micrograms/ml).	4
More importantly, our study found dietary silybin increased the abundance of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$, and it can produce acetate and propionate by consuming succinate and @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$.	2
More than 20 tetracycline-resistant efflux genes are identified, but only tet(A) to tet(E) and tet(K)-(L), which confer resistance to tetracycline and doxycycline, have been so far described in anaerobes, mainly in the @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ group. In addition, tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q), tet(W), and tet(32) are coding for ribosomal protection proteins associated with tetracycline resistance in anaerobic bacteria and confer resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and @sm$ minocycline @/sm$.	4
Moreover, @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ was reported to secrete 55 grams of @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ per liter in fed-batch cultures with methanol as sole carbon and ammonium as nitrogen source. These characteristics indicate that @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ is a valuable candidate for amino acid production from methanol which in turn is an interesting alternative to the conventional feedstocks used in the biotechnological industry, i.e. mainly molasses and starch hydrolysates. Methanol is advantageous since it is abundant, its price does neither depend on the climate nor on agricultural politics, it is a pure compound and it reduces the risk of contamination in fermentations due to its toxicity towards numerous microbial species. Fermentations with the comparatively reduced methanol are characterized by high oxygen demands and heating of bioreactors causing high cooling costs. However, this is less relevant for the thermophilic @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$.	1
Most of these pathways are biosynthesis pathways (55 out of 75), among which 7 pathways were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with @sm$ equol @/sm$ concentration in urine by using Spearman correlation analysis (Additional file 1: Figure 2). Chao1 index and evenness in metabolic pathways showed no significant differences between EP and NP, and richness in metabolic pathways was higher in EP than in NP (P = 0.86 for Chao1, P = 0.12 for Shannon-Wiener index, and P = 0.015 for Simpson index in Fig. 1b). Subsequently, we conducted constrained PCoA analysis on the metabolic pathways (Fig. 1e) and statistical significance test (anova.cca) on the result of constrained PCoA, which showed significant dissimilarity between EP and NP for metabolic pathways as well (Permanova P = 0.001). We also established an @sm$ equol @/sm$ production-related pathway based on the three critical gene sequences in A. equolifaciens 19450T, @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$, and Lactococcus garvieae to blast the reference dataset of HUMAnN2. We found only the genes from A. equolifaciens 19450T can be found with right annotation, and only these genes can be found in the result of HUMAnN2. So, we separated the relative abundances of these genes from the results of the gene part, then we used the relative abundances of these three genes to calculate the geometrical mean as the @sm$ equol @/sm$ metabolic-related pathway's abundance. As shown in Fig. 2 and Additional file 2: Table S1 and Table S2, this @sm$ equol @/sm$ production-related pathway was mainly identified and showed higher relative abundance in EP in this study.	1
Native and heat-treated HEWL was hydrolyzed with pepsin at pH 1.2, and their antibacterial activity was tested against Escherichia coli and @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$. Two of the hydrolysates obtained presented high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Native HEWL hydrolysate was a bactericide at 2.0 mg/mL against E. coli. Fifty-one peptide sequences were identified on the two hydrolysates. Peptides identified are cationic peptides. These peptides are rich in Lys and Arg cationic amino acids and have @sm$ Trp @/sm$ in their sequences.	3
Nisin production in continuous cultures of bioengineered @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ strains that incorporate additional immunity and regulation genes was studied. Highest nisin activities were observed at 0.2 h(-1) dilution rate and 12.5 g l(-1) @sm$ fructose @/sm$ concentration for all strains. Recombinant strains were able to produce greater amounts of nisin at dilution rates below 0.3 h(-1) compared to the control strain. However, this significant difference disappeared at dilution rates of 0.4 and 0.5 h(-1). For the strains LL27, LAC338, LAC339, and LAC340, optimum conditions for nisin production were determined to be at 0.29, 0.26, 0.27, and 0.27 h(-1) dilution rates and 11.95, 12.01, 11.63, and 12.50 g l(-1) @sm$ fructose @/sm$ concentrations, respectively. The highest nisin productivity, 496 IU ml(-1) h(-1), was achieved with LAC339. The results of this study suggest that low dilution rates stabilize the high specific nisin productivity of the bioengineered strains in continuous fermentation. Moreover, response surface methodology analysis showed that regulation genes yielded high nisin productivity at wide ranges of dilution rates and @sm$ fructose @/sm$ concentrations.	2
Non-antibiotic compounds, such as berberine, FOS, pravastatin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, @sm$ flucytosine @/sm$, and indomethacin also showed significant decreases in the abundances of over 10 genera. In addition, selective antibacterial activities were found in 35 out of the 39 non-antibiotic compounds at the genus level; at the species level, we found that 32 non-antibiotic compounds significantly altered the biomass of at least one bacterial species (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, FDR-adjusted p < 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, members of the Actinobacteria phyla, including Eggerthella, @gm$ Gordonibacter @/gm$, Slackia, and Adlercreutzia, were the most susceptible to drugs compared with most other genera (Supplementary Figure S6).	3
Notably, among genera that were increased in BD, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ showed positive correlations with l-5-hydroxytryptophan, d-alanyl-d-alanine, and allantoate. Moreover, Alloprevotella exhibited a positive correlation with l-5-hydroxytryptophan, whereas Megamonas showed a positive correlation with spermine, l-histidinol, @sm$ prostaglandin F2alpha @/sm$, and nicotinic acid.	0
Notably, more than 45 species/subspecies belonging to genus Bifidobacterium, have been characterized by their high content of guanine as well as @sm$ cytosine @/sm$ in their genome. Bifidobacterium are normal inhabitants of human gastrointestinal tract e.g., B. adolescentis, @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, B.	1
Nutritional interdependence among three representatives of rumen bacteria, Bacteroides amylophilus, @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$, and Ruminococcus albus, was studied with a basal medium consisting of minerals, vitamins, cysteine hydrochloride, and NH(4). B. amylophilus grew well in the basal medium supplemented with starch and produced branched-chain amino acids after growth ceased. When cocultured with B. amylophilus in the basal medium supplemented with starch and glucose, amino acid-dependent @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ produced an appreciable amount of branched-chain fatty acids, which are essential growth factors for cellulolytic R. albus. A small addition of starch (0.1 to 0.3%) to the basal medium containing glucose and cellobiose brought about successive growth of the three species in the order of B. amylophilus, @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$, and R. albus, and successive growth was substantiated by the formation of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids in the culture. Supplementation with 0.5% starch, however, failed to support the growth of R. albus. On the basis of these results, the effects of supplementary starch or branched-chain fatty acids on @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ digestion in the rumen was discussed.	2
Objective: @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ is an emerging hospital-acquired bacterial pathogen. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the antimicrobial resistance and transmission of @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$. Here, we characterized the microbiological and genomic features of a carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ strain harboring the blaNDM-1 gene in China. Methods: K. michiganensis strain 2563 was recovered from the sputum sample of a hospitalized patient with pulmonary infection. Whole-genome sequencing of K. michiganensis strain 2563 was conducted using both the short-read Illumina and long-read MinION platforms to thoroughly characterize the genetic context of blaNDM-carrying plasmid in K. michiganensis 2563. Furthermore, BacWGSTdb server was utilized to perform in silico multilocus sequence typing (MLST), identify antimicrobial resistance genes, and conduct genomic epidemiological analyses of the closely related isolates deposited in the public database. Results: K. michiganensis 2563 was resistant to piperacillin, aztreonam, meropenem, imipenem, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefazolin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$. It belonged to sequence type (ST) 43, and the blaNDM-1 gene was found to be located on the plasmid p2563_NDM (54,035 bp). This plasmid showed remarkable similarity to other blaNDM-1-encoding plasmids found in various Enterobacterium species in the public database. The occurrence of global ST43 @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ was primarily sporadic, and the closest relative of K. michiganensis 2563 was another ST43 isolate 12,084 recovered from China in 2013, which differed by 171 SNPs. Conclusion: Our study reports the genome characteristics of a carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ strain carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in China, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance of this pathogen in clinical settings.	4
Of the 200 different carbon sources and growth inhibitors tested, the most striking differences were observed for two beta-lactam antibiotics, @sm$ oxacillin @/sm$ and penicillin. Subsequent growth curve experiments confirmed that the ICE-betaox-containing donor and transconjugant @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ strains tolerated these antibiotics but that the naive recipient strain did not (Fig. 2A and B). We verified that ICE-betaox promotes bacterial survival and replication by quantifying CFU after a 6-h exposure to 100 microg/ml @sm$ oxacillin @/sm$ or 2 microg/ml penicillin G (Fig.	4
Of the 59 bacterial species absent from this study, 6 were actually collected from samples prior to @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ disinfection (i.e., as part of the 18 standard culture conditions), suggesting that they did not survive the disinfection procedure (i.e., LactobacilIus rhamnosus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Acidaminococcus intestinalis, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, Streptococcus mitis and Lactobacillus paracasei) (Appendix 1, Appendix 3).	3
Other crucial metabolites, such as SCFAs are synthesized in the gut by the fermentation of nondigestible @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ by certain microbes. Some of the major SCFAs including butyrate can also influence DNA methylation processes by inducing phosphorylation of ERK (MAP kinase1), which results in down-regulation of DNMT1 and consequently demethylation of tumor suppressor genes including RARB2, p21, and p16. The amount of butyrate synthesis depends on both dietary intake and synthesis by gut microbial communities. Various bacteria are known for butyrate production including @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, Odoribacter, Eubacterium, Peptoniphilus, Fusobacterium, Coprococcus, Porphyromonas, Faecalibacterium, Anaerotruncus, Clostridium, Subdoligranulum, and Roseburia.	1
Other species of Legionella that were tested included Legionella birminghamensis strain 1407-AL-H (ATCC 700709), @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$ strain Long Beach 4 (@gm$ ATCC 33462 @/gm$), and Legionella micdadei Stanford-R. Prior to infections, all L. pneumophila strains and other Legionella species were cultured for 3 days at 37 C on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar. In order to obtain @sm$ LPS @/sm$ samples, L.	0
Other species that are abundant in a healthy gut, including Lachnospiraceae such as Anaerostipes caccae, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, Roseburia spp., Coprococcus catus, and Eubacteriaceae such as Eubacterium rectale and Eubacterium hallii, are acetate consumers and produce butyrate via butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, which will be discussed in more detail later. There are a number of other examples of substrate cross-feeding that can have a substantial impact on the survival of certain bacteria and production of useful metabolites in the gut. For instance, @sm$ lactate @/sm$ is readily available in the gut as a result of the activity of lactic acid bacteria and can be utilized by Anaerostipes sp. and Eubacterium sp. to produce SCFAs. Similarly, C. catus and the ruminal bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii can convert @sm$ lactate @/sm$ to propionate via the acrylate pathway.	2
Our previous studies showed that the mRNA expression levels of tight junctions including claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-7, and claudin-11 were up-regulated with AKG supplementation after infection with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$. These observations were partly attributed to AKG supplementation improving @sm$ glutamine @/sm$ synthesis activity and concentrations of @sm$ Gln @/sm$ and glutamic acid in the intestines. @sm$ Gln @/sm$ has been shown to promote protein synthesis and intestinal development in fish. Dietary @sm$ Gln @/sm$ supplementation showed significantly higher expression levels of claudin 3, claudin 4, occludin, and ZO-1 in the intestines of turbot.	2
PABA-UDCA was cleaved by various intestinal aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; (aerobic bacteria) Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis; (anaerobic bacteria) Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium perfringens, @gm$ Eubacterium aerofaciens @/gm$, and Fusobacterium varium, indicating that these bacteria exhibit bile salt (or cholylglycine) hydrolase activity. PABA-UDCA was not hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, although other @sm$ UDCA @/sm$ conjugates, such as L-leucine-UDCA and L-lysine-UDCA, were cleaved by pancreatic enzymes, carboxypeptidase, and intestinal bacteria acting as bile salt hydrolase.	2
PCA (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid), @sm$ 4-HBA @/sm$, PGA (2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde), lipopolysaccharides from @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$ (LPS), methanol, and formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, United Kingdom). RPMI 1640 culture medium, fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). The cytometric bead array kit to analyze cytokine concentrations was purchased from BD Biosciences (Oxford, United Kingdom). Phagoburst and Phagotest kits as well as the opsonized E coli bacteria were manufactured by Glycotope Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Pg-3-glc, PCA, @sm$ 4-HBA @/sm$, and PGA were dissolved in acidified methanol (2% formic acid) to a concentration of 10 mmol/L and stored at -70 C and away from light.	0
PURPOSE: @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ is the second leading cause of diarrhoeal mortality especially in children <5 years of age in African and Asian countries. Rapid changes are occurring in the epidemiology of shigellosis and @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ are increasingly becoming highly drug resistant. To determine the serogroup distribution and antimicrobial resistance of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolated at our tertiary care centre in North India. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted where demographic details along with antimicrobial susceptibility data of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolated from stool specimens from 1st January 2015 till 31st December 2019 were retrieved from records and analyzed by WHONET 2019 software. RESULTS: @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species was isolated in 1.31% (n = 137) of a total of 10,456 stool samples. Males predominated (n = 82; 59.8%) and majority of cases were admitted (n = 94; 68.6%). Children <=5 years of age (n = 47; 34.3%) were the most commonly affected. Adults in the 21-40 age group contributed 27% of cases (n = 37). Overall, Shigella flexneri (n = 87; 63.5%) was the most common serogroup followed by non-agglutinable @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ (n = 28; 20.4%) while Shigella sonnei (n = 12, 8.8%) and @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$ (n = 9, 6.6%) fluctuated over the years. Shigella dysenteriae reappeared in 2019 after a hiatus of ten years. Overall, 45.3% (n = 62) of isolates were multidrug resistant to CLSI recommended drugs and high resistance was noted for ampicillin/amoxicillin (68.1%), cotrimoxazole (75.8%) ciprofloxacin (61.5%) and ceftriaxone/@sm$ cefotaxime @/sm$ (45.2%). CONCLUSIONS: @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ have become highly drug resistant to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins.	4
Parallel @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ were immobilized on a dipstick strip for multiplex analysis of target DNA sequences of the caries-associated bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Scardovia wiggsiae, Actinomyces species, and @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$. Streptavidin-coated blue-colored latex microspheres were to generate signal. Target DNA amplicons with an @sm$ oligonucleotide @/sm$-tagged terminus and a biotinylated terminus were coupled with latex beads through a streptavidin-biotin interaction and then hybridized with complementary @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ on the strip.	0
Preliminary studies showed that @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$ possessed significant in vitro activity against a variety of atypical mycobacteria such as the Mycobacterium avium complex, @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$, M. szulgai, M. malmoense, M. xenopi, M. marinum, and M. kansasii and rare pathogens such as M. chelonae and M. fortuitum. In this investigation, radiometric MICs of @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$, ethambutol, rifampin, amikacin, ofloxacin, and clofazimine for 10 clinical isolates of the M. avium complex (5 each from human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-positive and HIV-negative patients) were determined. @sm$ Roxithromycin @/sm$ MICs against all the isolates were below the reported maximum concentration of drug in serum at the routine pH of 6.8, and the MICs were further lowered by 1 to 2 dilutions at a pH of 7.4. In vitro enhancement of @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$ activity against all strains was further investigated by the previously established Bactec 460-TB method by combining the drugs at sub-MIC levels. Antibacterial activity of @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$ was enhanced in all 10 strains by ethambutol, in 3 strains each by rifampin and clofazimine, in 2 strains by amikacin, and in 1 strain by ofloxacin. In vitro screening of three-drug combinations showed that combinations of @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$, ethambutol, and a third potential anti-M.	3
Probiotic microorganisms (such as @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$, Bifidobacterum bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus) with nutritional functions which produce and sustain the vitamin balance of the human host can be named nutribiotics. Their action is based on the production of specific metabolites such as thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9-11), cobalamin (@sm$ B12 @/sm$), and vitamin K, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).	1
Propionate is synthesized from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the succinate pathway or the @sm$ acrylate @/sm$ pathway, in which lactate is reduced to propionate. The main propionate-producing bacteria are Bacteroides spp., phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, Dialister spp., Veillonella spp., Megasphaera elsdenii, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Salmonella spp., Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus obeum. Butyrate is formed from two molecules of acetyl-CoA, yielding acetoacetyl-CoA, which is further converted to butyryl-CoA via beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA. The main butyrate-producing bacteria are Coprococcus comes, Coprococcus eutactus, Anaerostipes spp., @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia spp.	1
RAST annotation of the @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ TN10 genome revealed the presence of chromate transporters, which are thought to be involved in Cr6+ resistance. A number of genes involved in @sm$ sulfur @/sm$ assimilation and transport and in iron sequestering were also detected.	2
RESULTS: Here, we characterized the gut microbiome of untreated and @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$-treated EAE mice over time to identify bacteria with neuroimmunomodulatory potential. We observed alterations in the gut microbiota composition following EAE induction. We found that @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ treatment ameliorates EAE, and that this protective effect is mediated via the microbiota. Notably, we observed increased abundance of bacteria known to be strong inducers of regulatory T cells, including members of Clostridium clusters XIVa and XVIII in @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$-treated mice during the presymptomatic phase of EAE, as well as at disease peak. We identified 50 bacterial taxa that correlate with EAE severity. Interestingly, several of these taxa exist in the human gut, and some of them have been implicated in multiple sclerosis including @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, a butyrate producer, which had a positive correlation with disease severity. We found that @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ ameliorates EAE, and this is associated with induction of RORgammat+ regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ as a potent modulator of the gut-brain axis by promoting the proliferation of bacterial species that induce regulatory T cells. In addition, our findings reveal 50 gut commensals as regulator of the gut-brain axis that can be used to further characterize pathogenic and beneficial host-microbiota interactions in multiple sclerosis patients. Our findings suggest that elevated @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$ in multiple sclerosis patients may represent a protective mechanism associated with recovery from the disease.	3
RNA-SIP has been successfully applied to in vitro models of the human gut to study the metabolism of simple sugars (monosaccharides like glucose) and complex plant @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ (i.e. starch). The more rapid incorporation of isotopic RNA over isotopic DNA [nearly 10-fold ] results in shorter incubation times, a major advantage given the possible modifications of activity and diversity of microbial cells when using in vitro model systems. Incubations of human fecal communities with isotope-labeled glucose revealed that Streptococcus bovis and Clostridium perfringens are both active glucose-fermenters. Similar studies using isotope-labeled starch highlighted the ability of Ruminococcus bromii to metabolize complex carbohydrates, whereas other microorganisms (Prevotella sp., Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium rectale) were shown to benefit from the byproducts of @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ utilization by these primary fermenters. Researchers have also identified bacteria capable of metabolizing galacto-oligosaccharides, including members of the Bifidobacteria (B.longum, B.bifidum, @gm$ B.catenulatum @/gm$) and Lactobacillus (L.gasseri, L.salivarus) genera.	2
Recent studies have shown that urolithin A prevents @sm$ streptozotocin @/sm$-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Eggerthellaceae abundance in HFD + EA + BC2000 was significantly higher than that in the HFD + EA group. This is mainly attributed to two species of the Eggerthellaceae family, @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ and Adlercreutzia mucosicola (Figure 4F,G).	0
Reduced pH is certainly not the only hazard that intracellular @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ encounter, as reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species are key defense mechanisms employed by infected phagocytic cells. In fact, ROS and nitric oxide production have been shown to be important for microbicidal activity against @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ in macrophages. SodC, a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase that counteracts ROS production, is required by B. abortus for survival within macrophages and virulence in a mouse model of infection. To resist the deleterious effects of RNS, @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ generate nitric oxide reductase to detoxify NO within macrophages. @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ also enlist AhpC, a peroxiredoxin that is primarily involved in scavenging endogeneous ROS generated by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ metabolism, to impart some resistance to @sm$ peroxynitrite @/sm$.	4
Regarding the beneficial effects of the genus @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, an interesting study is the one by Liang et al. conducted on adult GF rats; these underwent 21 days of restraint stress and were divided into two groups of daily treatment with @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ NS8 and @sm$ citalopram @/sm$, following which behavioral tests and biochemical analyses were performed. The results showed that @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ NS8 improved the cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions induced by the stress associated with chronic restraint (anxiety and depression), producing a similar or even greater effect than @sm$ citalopram @/sm$, as well as an increase in the expression of hippocampal BDNF mRNA. Furthermore, in a subsequent study, it was shown that a 10-day administration of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ Rhamnosous is able to normalize anxious behavior in rats.	3
Relative to @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, the most distinguishing features of the Bifidobacterium transcriptomes were markedly reduced or absent expression of pathways involved in (i) biosynthesis of cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and asparagine; (ii) utilization of several carbohydrates (xylose and b-xylosides plus galacturonate/@sm$ glucuronate @/sm$/glucuronide); (iii) biosynthesis of queuosine; and (iv) uptake of cobalt related to cobalamin bio-synthesis (Fig. 5B and tables S2J and S11B). Moreover, expression of four of these pathways (cysteine and asparagine biosynthesis; xylose/b-xyloside and galacturonate/@sm$ glucuronate @/sm$/glucuronide utilization) exclusively differentiate @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, B.	2
Relevant in vitro assays have proved that @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ strains isolated from slaughtered pigs are susceptible to many antibiotics, such as tetracycline, @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and resistant to aminopenicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. Heterogeneity of the antimicrobial resistance profile is shown to depend on the bioserotype and geographic distribution. Multidrug-resistant @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ bioserotype 4/O:3 isolates from pigs have increased lately.	3
Remarkably, most of these significantly decreased bacteria (Prevotellaceae_UCG-004, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Ruminiclostridium_5, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, and Ruminiclostridium_6) are regarded as potential beneficial bacteria in the intestine. Prevotellaceae has been demonstrated to display the characteristics of digesting high carbohydrate food, pectin, and hemicellulose. @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, a vital anaerobic genus, play a fundamental role in an intestinal ecosystem through decomposing polysaccharides. Therefore, the higher abundances of Prevotellaceae and @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ in the gut bacterial community contribute to more energy intake and meet the host's energy demand during growth. Ruminococcaceae, mainly colonizing in the caecum and colon, showed the ability to degrade @sm$ cellulose @/sm$ and starch.	2
Representative BPB include @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Roseburia intestinalis, Lachnoclostridium symbiosum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium saccharolyticum among others. BPB are highly oxygen-sensitive Gram-positive bacteria that, while capable of using simple oligosaccharides, appear to prefer molecules such as @sm$ lactate @/sm$, succinate, or acetate to produce butyrate.	2
Results obtained in these tests showed that FPA did not significantly detect @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ antibodies in the groups (Figure 3). Although Nielsen et al. standardized the FPA test in bovine milk without previous treatment, they recommended centrifugation of the samples to precipitate excess lipids, if a low sensitivity was observed. The presence of citric acid favors the precipitation of casein and the vigorous shaking fallowed by the centrifugation of the samples prevents the @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ from engulfing the conjugate, which facilitates its detection.	0
Rhamnose and @sm$ fucose @/sm$ are common components of plant cell walls and bacterial exopolysaccharides, and their degradation in the rumen results in lactaldehyde, which is reduced by lactaldehyde reductase to 1,2 propanediol (1,2-PD). There is no literature on the metabolism of 1,2-PD by @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$, but the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii can grow on 1,2-PD producing propionate and propanol as end products.	2
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) was recently reported to be upregulated in mosquitoes exposed to live @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$, compared to untreated mosquitoes or mosquitoes exposed to dead bacteria. Interestingly in the present work, patients with BU also displayed increased levels of riboflavin (Table 2). Inspection of the @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ genome predicts an intact riboflavin anabolic pathway. @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ is predicted to possess intact inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenases (e.g. MUL_0901) and GMP synthase (MUL_0913) and the subsequent enzymes to convert these molecules to GTP and enter the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. Increases in riboflavin are also consistent with the increased levels of the purine metabolism intermediates, @sm$ inosine @/sm$ and xanthine (see above).	1
S1), we noticed that 4/22 of the species enriched in patients with highest significance and fold-change were asaccharolytic species, i.e., microbes that are unable to metabolize carbohydrates and must rely on other @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources for energy, including Fusobacterium mortiferum, Desulfovibrio piger, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$, and Sutterella wadsworthensis, whereas no asaccharolytic species enriched in controls.	2
SCFAs analysis showed that @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ restriction decreased @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production in Hpa-Tg mice, which is consistent with studies reporting that the @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ is an @sm$ acetate @/sm$/succinate producer. Increasing evidences demonstrated that SCFAs exerted a potential protective role in pancreatic functions and pancreas disorders, such as diabetes and pancreatitis. Interestingly, we confirmed that @sm$ acetate @/sm$ supplementation mirrored the protective effects of @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ and significantly alleviated Hpa-induced AP phenotype. This finding suggests that the beneficial role of @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ in AP depended on @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production.	1
SPLS analysis of gut microbiota with circulating metabolites revealed positive correlations for blood @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ with the abundance of Bacteroides finegoldii, Bacteroides uniformis, Prevotella stercorea, and Escherichia coli, but a negative correlation with the abundance of @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$ (Figure 6a). To further delineate the link between GDM-related gut microbial alteration and signals in @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ metabolism, we calculated the species Shapley values in Random Forest (RF) regression model. Intriguingly, the significantly lower abundance of Alistipes onderdonkii, Bacteroides coprophilus, and Prevotella stercorea in the GDM group negatively contributed to the metabolic pathways involved in dopaminergic synapse (Figure 6b), betalain biosynthesis (Figure 6c), and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis (Figure 6d) (FDR p < .05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), all of which function as the key events in the cascade of @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ metabolism (https://www.genome.jp/entry/map04728). These data that show a link between marked alteration in the abundance of gut microbial species and key steps in @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ metabolism may provide further evidence of a close association between gut microbiota-driven disordered @sm$ dopamine @/sm$ metabolism and GDM development.	3
Saccharomyces cerevisiae can convert @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$, lipids, and amino acids into volatile aroma substances includes alcohol, esters, organic acids, hydrocarbons, and some other compounds (e.g., 3-octanone and 2-pentylfuran) during the growth and metabolism process, which constitute the basic volatile aroma substances in dough (De Vuyst et al., 2014). @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ (facultatively heterofermentative) metabolize hexose through EMP pathway and produce organic acids, metabolize pentose through HMP pathway, generate ethanol and acetic acid, and degrade leucine and phenylalanine to produce alcohols. Esters are derived from the esterification between acids and alcohols, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid are usually formed with different alcohols (De Vuyst et al., 2014; Samoticha et al., 2019). Therefore, as ester precursors, esters formation leads to the decreasing of alcohols and acids. The esters formed by short-chain acids are usually fruity, such as acetic acid ethyl ester and acetic acid hexyl ester (Li & Wang, 2013). Among them, ethyl ester with strong fruit and wine aroma is considered to play an important role in fermenting food and can impart its fruity aroma (De Vuyst et al., 2014). Consequently, the addition of P. pentosaceu as a leavening agent makes the fermentation aroma better and also makes Laomian steamed bread more popular with consumers. In the same vein, polymers produced from @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ may be beneficially affect a number of technological properties of steamed bread, including water absorption of the dough, increased loaf volume, and retarded bread staling.	1
Salmonella Kentucky (SK), @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ (@gm$ SE @/gm$), and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) were passaged 3 times every 8 h in sterile tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Difco, Sparks, MD, USA) at 37  C. All media were supplemented with @sm$ novobiocin @/sm$ (25 microg/mL; Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA) and nalidixic acid (20 microg/mL; MP Biomedicals, LLC, Illkirch, France) to control for growth of extraneous bacteria. Isolates were selected for resistance for differential plating. The SK isolate was selected for resistance to rifampicin (32 microg/mL; Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Portland, OR, USA). The ST and @gm$ SE @/gm$ isolates were selected for resistance to gentamicin (50 microg/mL; Corning, Manassas, VA, USA).	4
Septic arthritis caused by @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ complex is rare, with most infections occurring in patients who are immunosuppressed or with chronic skin disease. Other presentations have been published as case reports, often occurring in those with joint replacement, immunosuppression, and one case of a 3-year-old child diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), receiving @sm$ methotrexate @/sm$.	3
Several other @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ genes that are absent from C. difficile could play a role in adaptation to acidic conditions (Table 1; Fig. 9a). Glutamate decarboxylase converts @sm$ glutamate @/sm$ to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which absorbs a proton during the reaction.	1
Short-chain fatty acids:butyrate, @sm$ acetate @/sm$, formate, and propionate:are the main products of this genus. @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Coprococcus comes, and Coprococcus eutactus are the species with significant metabolite fluxes. These species play a significant role in carbohydrate metabolism. @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ is a known propionate producer which uses lactate as its main carbon source, and a study shows 3,4-dehydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to DOPAC conversion can be related to this species. The conversion of 3,4-dehydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to DOPAC can be related to Coprococcus comes, in addition to @gm$ C. catus @/gm$.	1
Six weeks after transplantation, no statistically significant difference was detected between PPDM and HSDM in the levels of ALT, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, @sm$ TG @/sm$, CREA and urea (Table 2). To test if the oral microbial composition of mice in HSDM and PPDM was affected by transplantation, three periodontal pathogens (i.e. P. gingivalis, @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ and F. nucleatum) were selected and their distributions were compared. Elevated relative abundance of P. gingivalis (Figure 2(d)) and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ (Figure 2(e)) were observed in the PPDM recipient mice, while the difference in the relative abundance of F.	0
Some @sm$ glucans @/sm$, including beta-glucan, can promote the growth of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ as it is capable of decomposing dietary polysaccharides.	2
Some archaea species, classified as methanogenic, produce methane from @sm$ carbon dioxide @/sm$ as an energy source for growth. Five different methanogenic archaea genera have been identified in the oral cavity of healthy patients - @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$, Methanosphaera, Methanosarcina, Thermoplasmata and Methanobacterium . Among these, @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$, Methanobacterium congelense/curvum and Methanosarcina mazeii are the main archaea species found in healthy patients, with M.	1
Some of the microbial signatures detected mirrored those observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance in the butyrate producing genus Blautia, and elevated abundance of @sm$ lactic-acid @/sm$ producing Bifidobacteria and genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. In addition, some species-level alterations detected by metagenomic sequencing in TCE exposed rats were reflective of reported changes in genera from PD gut microbiota, such as Parasutterella, @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$, and Mucispirillum.	1
Some physiological and molecular changes contribute to a more stress-tolerant state of bacteria, such as increased @sm$ saturated fatty acid @/sm$ content, decreased membrane fluidity, accelerated malate and citrate utilization, increased expression of heat shock protein, and activated H+-ATPase activity. However, the mechanisms regulating the heat tolerance of @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ still need to be further explored.	0
Some species such as @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ possess both heterotrophic and autotrophic properties and can use CO, @sm$ H2 @/sm$/CO2, and carbohydrates as energy sources.	2
Some work suggested that fecal bacterial communities could be divided into three enterotypes (Bacteroides, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, and Ruminococcus; Arumugam et al.,; Wu et al.,). Nowadays, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been widely used in the treatment of patients with IBD, which was found to be an effective therapy for some recipients (Kelly et al.,; Ince et al.,; Vermeire et al.,); thus, it was concluded that there should be some close connections between fecal microbiota and IBD. Probert et al. compared IBD patients and animal models of colitis with healthy individuals, and they found that the @sm$ volatile organic compound @/sm$ (VOC) in feces held a potential role in identifying a novel diagnostic method for IBD.	0
Species belonging to the genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Paraprevotella, Alloprevotella, Barnesiella, and Tannerella are saccharolytic, while species belonging to Odoribacter and Porphyromonas are predominantly asaccharolytic. Some Bacteroides spp. and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp. can degrade complex plant polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, xylans, and pectins. The Bacteroidetes species play also an important role in protein metabolism, as some species have proteolytic activity, assigned to the proteases that are linked to the cell wall, while some Bacteroides spp. have a potential to utilize @sm$ urea @/sm$ as a nitrogen source.	2
Species of the Roseburia and Coprococcus genera were described as capable to degrade @sm$ starch @/sm$ and ferment other carbohydrates to synthesizing SCFA. The composition of lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera) differed between AD and HC children. The Enterococcus genus was found at the highest level in fecal samples of PDD-NOS children. In agreement with a previous report, the level of some Bacteroidetes genera (Bacteroides, Barnesiella, @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ and Parabacteroides) and some Prevotella and Alistipes species were almost the highest in AD children.	2
Species-specific 16S rRNA-targeted, Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labeled @sm$ oligonucleotide @/sm$ probes were designed and validated to quantify different Eubacterium species in human fecal samples. Probes were directed at Eubacterium barkeri, E. biforme, E. contortum, E. cylindroides (two probes), E. dolichum, @gm$ E. hadrum @/gm$, E. lentum, E. limosum, E. moniliforme, and E. ventriosum. The specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. With one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. The species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. E. biforme, E. cylindroides, @gm$ E. hadrum @/gm$, E.	0
Specifically, @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ thermophiles, applied as a cream for 7 days, has been shown to increase ceramide production both in vitro and in vivo. Not only do ceramides trap moisture in the skin, but certain ceramide sphingolipids, such as @sm$ phytosphingosine @/sm$ (@sm$ PS @/sm$), exhibit direct antimicrobial activity against P. acnes. The clinical application of @sm$ PS @/sm$ has been further substantiated by a 2-month pilot study showing an 89% reduction of acneiform papules and pustules after the application of 0.2% @sm$ PS @/sm$.	1
Spirochetes are currently divided into three phylogenetic groups: Spirochaetaceae including Borrelia, Spirochaeta, Spironema and Treponema; Leptospiraceae including Leptonema and Leptospira; and finally Brachyspiraceae containing the intestinal spirochetes of @gm$ Brachyspira @/gm$ (Serpulina). Brachyspira aalborgi (B. aalborgi) and @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ (@gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$), the two members of Brachyspiraceae family, are both described in humans and are considered as cause of human intestinal spirochetosis  . The anaerobic weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochete B. aalborgi, was first isolated in 1982 in the stool of a patient from Denmark  , whereas @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ is responsible for colitis and typhlytis in pigs, poultry and other species, acting more as zoonotic agent  . Since 1997, @gm$ Brachyspira @/gm$ spp. have been included in the list of human enteropathogenic bacteria  . These two spirochetes are slow growing fastidious anaerobes and require specific media, with estimated growth times of 6 days for @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ and up to 2 weeks for B.aalborgi. Morphologically, they are coiled Gram-negative bacilli and are mobile in liquid environment due to the presence of flagella. Generally they are considered non invasive microorganisms but systemic spread of @gm$ B.pilosicoli @/gm$ has been documented by culture of blood specimens obtained from critically ill patients  . Concomitant infection by B.aalborgi and @gm$ B.pilosicoli @/gm$ is described but rare  . These spirochetes are susceptible to different antibiotics, such as metronidazole, meropenem, chloramphenicol, @sm$ ceftriaxone @/sm$ and tetracycline, whereas a 60% resistance rate to ciprofloxacine has been observed.	3
Spirochetes was increased by PMSF, IOD, and their combination but decreased by @sm$ IMI @/sm$-IOD and SDS. The genus Fibrobacter almost disappeared in the @sm$ IMI @/sm$-containing treatments and the SDS treatment (Table 3), but its relative abundance was increased by 2.60-fold by IOD (Supplementary Figure S1). Streptococcus was increased by @sm$ IMI @/sm$, @sm$ IMI @/sm$-IOD, and SDS. A sharp increase of Succinivibrio was observed in the @sm$ IMI @/sm$-PMSF, PMSF-IOD, and 3Mix treatments. @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ was found in all the @sm$ IMI @/sm$-containing treatments and SDS treatment but not in the control, and the relative abundance of Ruminobacter was increased by all the treatments up to 35.43% (Supplementary Figure S1).	3
SpuA, the homolog of ApuA in @gm$ S. pneumoniae @/gm$, has also been demonstrated to be a virulence factor which can degrade @sm$ glycogen @/sm$ into a ladder of maltodextrins.	2
Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1) is a key enzyme involved with the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.7 Inhibitors of SCD-1 have been developed to target the pathway in several diseases including metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis C virus, cancer, and skin disorders including acne.8 Production of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ and lipids in sebaceous glands is essential for the development of acne as follows. Excessive production of sebum (seborrhea) promotes the growth of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ and, in turn, contributes to inflammation, keratinocyte proliferation, and papule formation.	1
Strain M25(T) was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced @sm$ lactate @/sm$ and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in PYG medium, and had a DNA G+C content of 41.6 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that strain M25(T) was closely related to @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 29174 @/gm$(T) (96.40 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Blautia glucerasea HFTH-1(T) (96.17 %) within the family Lachnospiraceae.	1
Strains belonging to the genus Bacillus, such as @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$, B. thuringiensis, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. megaterium, employed in the formulation of PGPR products, are currently used by the agricultural industry to combat and manage pests. In recent decades, the species B. velezensis has become one of the most, if not the most, commonly used PGPR. Some of the strains belonging to this species are capable of producing a wide variety of metabolites, such as siderophores, enzymes, @sm$ volatile organic compounds @/sm$ (@sm$ VOC @/sm$) and lipopeptides, which contribute to both their biofertilizing activity and biocontrol capacity through direct competition, by activating induced systemic resistance (ISR) and by modifying the host-plant microbiome.	1
Strains used in this study include strains of Lactobacillus spp., @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp., Enterococcus spp., Bacillus spp., and other bacterial species, such as those of the family of Enterobacteriaceae (Table 1). These strains were obtained from Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC; Hsin-Chu, Taiwan) and American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). All LAB strains were maintained at -80 C as 25% glycerol stocks. Strains of Lactobacillus spp. were grown in deMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), while strains of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. were grown in MRS broth plus 0.05% @sm$ L-cystine @/sm$ under anaerobic conditions at 37 C.	2
Strong and consistent microbiota associations emerged for HbA1c, glucose, C-reactive protein, and principal components of genes upregulated in inflammation, DNA repair, and @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$, with Streptococcus infantis, Pseudomonas spp., and Peptoniphilus as major players for each. This pattern was largely echoed (though attenuated) for immunological cell composition gene sets, and only Serratia varied meaningfully by transcriptomic age. Network co-abundance indicated relationships between Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., and Ruminococcus sp. and gut immune/metabolic regulatory activity, and Ruminococcus sp, Dialister, and @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ with balance between Th1 and Th2 inflammation.	0
Studies on anti-T2DM activity of fibers have shown that dietary fibers increase the abundance of some species, for instance, Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia, Prevotella, @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium, and decrease the number of some Gram-negative bacteria, for instance, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae (LPS-producing bacteria). More importantly, these changes induced by dietary fiber intervention enhance the production of SCFAs, which can bind to the GPR and enhance the level of the enteroendocrine hormones PYY and GLP-1 in gut epithelial L-cells, thereby improving IR, appetite regulation, and energy intake/ expenditure, as well as @sm$ lipid @/sm$ oxidation. The alleviating effect of pumpkin polysaccharide in HFD-fed mice is linked with increased SCFA production and selective enhancement of some bacteria, for instance, Bacteroidetes, Prevotella, and Deltaproteobacteria. Administration of inulin can reduce the fasting blood glucose level, increase GLP-1 level, and alleviate glucose intolerance as well as blood @sm$ lipid @/sm$ contents in rats with T2DM induced by HFD and streptozotocin.	1
Subsequently, Lactobacillus plantarum and @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ were coinoculated as amine-negative starter at an optimized ratio of 1:2. Coinoculation induced a significant reduction in total BAs (43.7%, 44.5 mg L-1), putrescine (43.0%, 20.4 mg L-1), @sm$ tyramine @/sm$ (42.8%, 14.3 mg L-1), and histamine (42.6%, 3.5 mg L-1) content. Notably, BAs degradation ability of @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ was stronger than the suppression effect of Lactobacillus plantarum, and higher lactic acid bacteria (LAB) amount has a positive correlation with lower BAs content.	2
TK6 and @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, respectively, known to oxidise cyclic alcohols but not N-heterocyclic alcohols, such as hydroxyhexamethyleneimine.Therefore, the role of the GMOLON4_2241 product in the degradation of @sm$ molinate @/sm$ in strain ON4T needs further experimental validation.	2
Taxonomically, Alloprevotella, Actinobacillus, and Anaerovibrio were enriched during pregnancy, while @gm$ Treponema @/gm$, Lachnospiraceae, and Methanosphaera were more abundant during the postpartum period. Functionally, pregnancy was associated with an increased abundance of pathways producing butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that is beneficial during pregnancy, while the postpartum period was characterized by increased abundance of pathways associated with @sm$ starch @/sm$ degradation and folate transformation.	2
Tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaA, hyl and cylA) and antibiotic resistance was checked only for Enterococcus faecium and @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$ isolates. The antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. From the 120 food samples analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. E. faecium was the predominant species, followed by @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$, E. casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum. Phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7% of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. Antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more frequent in @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ than in E. faecium. Three E. faecium isolates were resistant to @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$. Among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to Caco-2 cells. Antibiotic-resistant @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ and E.	4
The 12 Haemophilus strains comprised three API NH codes classed as @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ and two codes classed as Haemophilus aphrophilus/paraphrophilus. Six cell wall @sm$ lipid @/sm$ profiles were detected, but these were not related to API NH codes.	0
The 192 species that showed differential abundance (P.adj < = 0.05) between day - 3 and 42 days of treatment with @sm$ sibutramine @/sm$ were classified into a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6A). Concentric circles reveal differential enrichment at every classification level from phylum (inside) to species (outside) (Fig. 6A). Actinobacteria species detected showed a significant decrease by the end of the treatment. Moreover, a redistribution of several probiotic species is evident. Five members of Bifidobacteriaceae, such as @gm$ B.pseudolongum @/gm$, B.animalis, B.catenulatum, B.dentium and B.scardovii were significantly decreased, while two Lactobacillales, L.reuteri and L ruminis, increased by the end of the treatment. At the phylum level, Firmicutes did not show overall significant changes, as some of their species increase, such as Flavonifractor plautii, while others were decrease in abundance. Bacteroidetes were significantly increased by Day 42, with 13 species significantly increased by @sm$ sibutramine @/sm$ treatment; B.thetaiotamicron, B.caecimuris, B.heparinolyticus, B.	3
The @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ strain produced a metabolic end-product, i.e., @sm$ valeric acid @/sm$, which binds to the GABA-A receptor and releases GABA and helps to treat anxiety and insomnia.	1
The @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolates originating from human were all resistant to fourteen (14) antibiotics. A higher frequency of antimicrobial resistance was observed to tetracycline 55 %, ticarcillin 38 %, @sm$ amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid @/sm$, ampicillin, amoxicillin 36 % and trimethoprime/sulfamexazol 33 %. Low frequency of resistance was observed to imipenem 3 %, ceftriaxon, cefotaxime 5 %, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin 7 % and nalidixic-acid 10 % (Table 4). From different serotypes tested, the high resistance was observed with tetracycline 14/20, ampicillin, amoxicillin, @sm$ amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid @/sm$, ticarcillin 12/20, trimethoprime/sulfamexazol 11/20 and chloramphenicol 10/20 to @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ ParatyphiB. Resistance was observed to imipenem 02/20, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic-acid, and gentamicin 01/20 with @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ ParatyphiB.	4
The @sm$ lactone @/sm$ ring of the resulting thiolester was opened by acid hydrolysis and the CoA derivative was obtained by transesterification. 2) Pure glutaconate CoA-transferase from @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ catalysed the formation of the 1- and the 5-isomer of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.	2
The @sm$ starch @/sm$ utilization system (Sus), ABC transport system and multienzyme complexes system are the main mechanisms for the degradation of polysaccharides by gut microbiota. The Sus is an important way for Bacteroides to degrade polysaccharides. Sus R, as a transmembrane regulator, can detect the decomposition of polysaccharides. SusE and SusF proteins can recognize the polysaccharides and collect them at the cell surface. GHs decompose the polysaccharides into several oligosaccharides, which are bound by SusD protein and transported from the outer membrane into the periplasm by SusC protein. These oligosaccharides are further degraded into smaller oligosaccharides by GHs or PLs and further degraded into glucose by linking specific Sus A and Sus B before entering the cytoplasm. Although Firmicutes have fewer genes encoding CAZymes, they encode more ABC transporters, phosphoenolpyruvate, carbohydrate PTS transporters, major facilitator superfamily transporters and glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide transporters to transport carbohydrates. The multienzyme complexes system can efficiently degrade cellulose or resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ by interacting with dockerins and cohesins domains. This system has been found in @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ in human feces; dockerin is a small domain found in enzyme components and cohesin is a beta-sandwich domain found in non-catalytic scaffold proteins that provides carbohydrate binding and/or cell wall anchoring functions.	2
The DNA @sm$ G + C @/sm$ content of the representative strain FR41/2 was 60.5% (average of two experiments, SD = 0.71). The average DNA @sm$ G + C @/sm$ content of six strains in the group was 61.1% (SD = 0.67), which is also the @sm$ G + C @/sm$ content of the B. mongoliense type strain (YIT 10443T). Those values were higher than the @sm$ G + C @/sm$ contents of B. psychraerophilum LMG 21775T (55.7%) and @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ @gm$ LMG 23609 @/gm$T (56.4%), using the Tm method. However, similar DNA @sm$ G + C @/sm$ contents are found with the same method in the genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, for the species B.	0
The ability of the different @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ strains and NulO mutants to form biofilm on an abiotic surface was evaluated according to). Cultures were grown for 2-3 d in half-concentrated BHI medium, diluted to an OD600 ~0.05 with sterile nutrient medium, and 1-ml aliquots were transferred into 24-well polystyrene plates (STARLAB) that were coated overnight at 37  C with 500 microl of mucin (from bovine submaxillary gland, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5). As a control, sterile nutrient medium was used. Cultures were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 C for 3 d (T. forsythia ATCC 43037, @gm$ ATCC 43037 @/gm$  pseC and @gm$ ATCC 43037 @/gm$  pseCcomp) or 6 d (@gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ UB4, @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ UB4  legC and @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ UB4  legCcomp) without shaking. Two wells of each sample were used to determine the total optical density of the strains for later normalization. Subsequently, planktonic cells were gently removed with a pipette and the plates were washed once with @sm$ PBS @/sm$ buffer. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of @sm$ PBS @/sm$ buffer and the OD600 of the biofilm was determined.	0
The activities of OMC and comparators were evaluated against the following anaerobic organisms from the Micromyx repository (n = 186; Tables 1 and 2): Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides ovatus, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, and Prevotella spp. The test organisms consisted of randomly selected, nonconsecutive, nonduplicate human clinical isolates collected from 2006 to 2016 within the United States; most of the isolates were from abscesses, wounds, or infections of the gallbladder, blood, or abdomen. C. difficile isolates were isolated from stool samples. Nine of the evaluated @gm$ P. asaccharolytica @/gm$ isolates were veterinary in origin, collected in 2007 in Japan. OMC powder was provided by Paratek and was stored at -80 C. Comparator drugs included @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$ (@sm$ TGC @/sm$), meropenem (MEM), moxifloxacin (MXF), CLI, MTZ, and piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP).	3
The activity of triglycerides and lipids from bovine milk was investigated against @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$, S. enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, L. monocytogenes, and Clostridium perfringens by Sprong et al.. C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids and sphingolipids showed bactericidal activity, whereas @sm$ phosphoglycerides @/sm$ were moderately bactericidal. These authors also studied the activity of sphingolipids combined with C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids, and unsaturated C18 fatty acids; L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni were very sensitive, whereas @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ and S.	3
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effective duration of antimicrobial activity of a @sm$ calcium hydroxide @/sm$-based medicament (Apex Cal) and 2% chlorhexidene gluconate gel against selected endodontic pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$). The agar diffusion test was used to determine the antimicrobial activity. Chlorhexidene gluconate gel showed the largest inhibitory zones. The antimicrobial action of both medicaments decreased significantly with time, with @sm$ calcium hydroxide @/sm$ showing no antimicrobial action after 72 hours. In conclusion, 2% chlorhexidene gel showed better antimicrobial activity than @sm$ calcium hydroxide @/sm$, and the effective antimicrobial action of both medicaments decreased after 48 hours.	3
The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.	3
The antimicrobial activity of aqueous, methanol, hexane, and @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$ extracts from edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against nine foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was screened with a disk diffusion assay. Twenty-nine of the 48 species tested had antimicrobial activity. Methanol, @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$, and aqueous extracts accounted for 92.8% of the positive assays, whereas the hexane extracts accounted for only 7.2%.	3

The biological activities of natural @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ are closely correlated to their metabolic properties from the stomach to the intestine. Recently, increasing studies using in vitro models indicate that non-starch @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ can not be entirely digested into oligosaccharides and monosaccharides or directly absorbed in human upper gastrointestinal tract due to the absence of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), consequently, these indigestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ can reach large intestine to be fermented. Generally, thousands of microbial species live in human intestine, and the microbial composition is closely related to the host health. Notably, the gut microbiota can encode a large number of CAZymes for the degradation of natural @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ into small sugars, further exerting beneficial effects on the host. Numerous studies have proven that the indigestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ can modulate the gut health via promoting the proliferation of some beneficial bacteria, such as @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium species. At the same time, the indigestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ can be utilized by the relevant human gut bacteria to produce several metabolic products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs, primarily acetate, propionate and butyrate), which have been implicated in a low risk of metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Therefore, the indigestible @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ seem to possess many properties related to preserve host health, and the exploring the interaction between @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ and gut microbiota is important for the evaluation the health benefits of natural @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$.	2
The broth microdilution method (FOSUN DIAGNOSTICS, Shanghai, China) was used to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of the @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ isolates. Chloramphenicol (CPL), compound @sm$ sulfamethoxazole @/sm$ (SMZco), clindamycin (DA), erythromycin (ERY), tetracycline (TC), linezolid (LZD), levofloxacin (LEV), moxifloxacin (MXF), penicillin (PG), cefepime (FEP), cefotaxime (CTX), meropenem (MEM), amoxicillin (AML), vancomycin (VA), and teicoplanin (TEC) were tested. The E-test method (Liofilchem, Italy) was used to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of the @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ isolates to streptomycin (SM) and ceftriaxone (CRO). Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was used as a quality control isolate. Breakpoints for sensitive, intermediate, and resistant types were defined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M100 (31st edition) when available, otherwise, EUCAST (v 13.0) clinical breakpoint cutoff values12 were used. The reference breakpoint of SM was determined based on the high-level resistance values for SM in @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ reported by Marie J.	3
The changes in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, the content of basic phospholipase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ in patients with H. pylori infection in the @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ FSCDJY67L3 and placebo groups are shown in  Figures 5 ,  6 . In the placebo and @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$ FSCDJY67L3 groups, there were no significant differences between the immune mediators in the serum of the patients before and after the intervention.	0
The chemical and physical properties of these reverse amide conjugated bile acid analogs were compared with those of the normal glycine and @sm$ beta-alanine @/sm$ conjugates. The reverse amide analogs comigrated with their isomeric @sm$ beta-alanine @/sm$ conjugates during thin-layer chromatography using a variety of solvent systems. However, the isomeric pairs could be resolved by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, with the reverse amides having greater retention times compared to the @sm$ beta-alanine @/sm$ conjugates. Critical micelle concentrations, solubility of undissociated forms, and acid dissociation constants were similar for the isomeric pairs. Significant differences in melting points were observed, however, While the isomeric pairs showed no significant differences in sensitivity to base hydrolysis, the reverse amides were not hydrolyzed by the cholylglycine hydrolase from @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$, even after long incubation periods.	4
The correlation analysis showed a significant association of the abundances of @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Coprococcus with butyrate concentration in both QPP and NQPH lines in this individual microbiome (Figures 4A-D), suggesting these organisms are potential contributors to the pool of butyrate produced during fermentations. The relationship between propionate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and other taxa varied widely by subject. Both @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and propionate were correlated with each other (S1, S3, and S4), total starch content (S1 and S2 only propionate; S3 and S4 only @sm$ acetate @/sm$), and a number of bacterial ASVs including prevalent ASVs of Bacteroides (S1-S4), Blautia (S1 and S2 only @sm$ acetate @/sm$) and Faecalibacterium (S1).	1
The dehydratase is not specific for the CoA-moiety because (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-thioesters of N-acetylcysteamine and @sm$ pantetheine @/sm$ served as almost equal substrates. Whereas the related 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase generated the stable and inhibitory 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA radical, the analogous allylic ketyl radical could not be detected with muconyl-CoA and 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase. With the exception of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, all mono-CoA-thioesters of dicarboxylates used in this study were synthesized with glutaconate CoA-transferase from @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$.	2
The diagnostic analysis of CSF for neurosyphilis includes a mononuclear, predominant pleocytosis >10 cells/muL, elevated protein concentration >45 mg/dL, and normal or decreased @sm$ glucose @/sm$ concentration. Although CSF-VDRL tests may be abnormal in syphilitic meningitis (70-80% sensitivity), a negative result does not rule out neurosyphilis. In some cases, initial CSF-VDRL may be negative. On the other hand, CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific but more sensitive than CSF-VDRL and may be used to exclude the neurosyphilis. In addition, PCR assays detect @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ in CSF 50% of patients for syphilitic CNS involvement.	0
The draft genome sequence of Anaerococcus provenciensis is bigger than that of @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$ (2.26 Mbp and 1.99 Mbp, respectively). The @sm$ G+C @/sm$ content (33.48%) is slightly lower than that of @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$ (35.7%).	0
The drinking habit was found to be highly connected with the abundance of microbiota in alpha-diversity, which is consistent with a previous study that @sm$ alcohol @/sm$ could be seen as a more important risk factor among oropharynx and hypopharynx carcinoma than the oral cavity or larynx (Supplementary Figure 6A-D). After subsequent categorization of the HC group, we found that genera Fusobacterium and @gm$ Parvimonas @/gm$ were presented in greater quantities in advanced-stage T classification (T3-T4) and the highest advanced stage (TNM IV), when compared to the early-stage T classification (T1-2) and TNM II-III, respectively, which was consistent with the result of swab testing in OPM of HPSCC patient. Both @gm$ Parvimonas @/gm$ and Fusobacterium were found to be associated with periodontal disease, and diagnostic biomarkers for CRC and OSCC.	0
The emergence of MDR-TB (multidrug resistant tuberculosis), caused by @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ (@gm$ MTB @/gm$) that is resistant to at least isoniazid and @sm$ rifampicin @/sm$, is posing a great threat to global public health.	4
The fecal microbiota of the pink-footed goose is dominated by pseudomonas, whose membranes are known to have the ability to hydrolyze phytate and degrade @sm$ starch @/sm$ in soils, they are known to improve plant phosphorus availability (Maougal et al., 2014). The pink-footed goose is the most common species of goose and herbivores that utilize both the green and root parts of plants (Fox et al., 2006). However, four OTUs (OTU00003 (Streptococcus infantis), OTU00006 (@gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$), OTU00007 (Veillonella unclassified), and OTU00008 (Veillonella unclassified)) were abundant in snow bunting and sanderling samples but mostly absent from the pink-footed goose samples.	0
The genera Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, Butyrivibrio, Methylobacterium and Microbacterium, and the family Erysipelotrichaceae were significantly more abundant in the IBS-C group than the control group, and the abundances of Streptococcus, Acidaminococcus, Butyricicoccus and @gm$ Parvimonas @/gm$ were significantly higher in the IBS-D group than the control group. In addition, the proportion of genes responsible for the secretion system and @sm$ LPS @/sm$ biosynthesis were significantly higher and the proportion of genes responsible for methane metabolism, lysine biosynthesis and enzyme families were significantly lower in the IBS-D group than in the IBS-C group.	0
The genomes of all strains encoded the GH2, GH13, GH36, GH42, and GH77 families of glycosidase hydrolases, and they were predicted to be primarily amylases as well as some beta-galactosidases that are involved in degrading most of the non-digestible @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources in staple foods and dairy products. These glycosidases are essential for the proliferation of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and can be considered core bifidobacterial glycoside hydrolases. @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genomes also encode glycoside hydrolases associated with the degradation of host-derived @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources, and these are encoded in the largest number in the genomes of B. bifidum and B. longum subsp. infantis. For example, B. bifidum and B. longum subsp. infantis encode an average of four beta-hexosaminidase genes in the GH20 family, but B. adolescens does not possess genes for this enzyme. alpha-Fucosidases of the GH95 family are encoded in the genomes of B. bifidum, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. breve, and some strains of B. pseudocatenulatum, and they are involved in the degradation of 2'-fucosyllactose. B. longum subsp. infantis encodes an average of two sialidases from the GH33 family, which is possibly related to the degradation of sialyllactose or other sialic-acid-modified glycans in HMOs. The three strains of B. bifidum encode an average of two sialidases from the GH33 family in ages 0-17 y, but B. bifidum from subjects of age 18-65 y does not encode these enzymes, and there is only an average of one sialidase from the GH33 family in samples from the 66-108 y age group. Different glycoside hydrolases endow @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ with specific @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source utilization abilities, provide a unique ecological adaptation mechanism, and affect interactions with other species.	2
The genus @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$, which has the ability to produce lactic acid from @sm$ glucose @/sm$, consists of eleven species that can be divided in two phylogenetic groups: the first group contains L. garvieae, Lactococcus lactis, @gm$ Lactococcus taiwanensis @/gm$, Lactococcus hircilactis, Lactococcus fujiensis, and Lactococcus formosensis, and the second group comprises Lactococcus laudensis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus chungangensis, Lactococcus plantarum, and Lactococcus piscium.	1
The growth and biofilm formation of @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ and Streptococcus oralis were inhibited by H2S. However, H2S did not significantly affect the growth of Streptococcus gordonii or Streptococcus sanguinis. The differential susceptibility of oral streptococci to H2S was attributed to differences in the intracellular concentrations of reduced @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ (@sm$ GSH @/sm$). In the absence of @sm$ GSH @/sm$, H2S elicited its toxicity through an iron-dependent mechanism.	3
The heavy metal type and concentration, as well as the environmental growth conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the duration of the microorganisms' interaction with toxic metals, all affect the ability of live cells to remove @sm$ metal @/sm$ ions from aqueous solutions. In this study, we analyzed the effects of temperature, pH, and incubation time on @sm$ metal @/sm$ uptake by @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. The effect of different incubation temperature on the uptake of the eight selected metals (Fig. 5A) was examined, revealing that 35 C was the optimum temperature for Cd, Pb, Zn, F, and Co uptake. At 35 C, the removal rates were increased compared to 37 C, changing from 45 to 67, 65 to 89, 55 to 56.5, and 50 to 65% for Cd, Pb, Zn, F, and Co respectively. In addition, 25 C was optimum for Cr, Cu and Ni uptake, with maximum rates of @sm$ metal @/sm$ reduction of 75, 50, and 65% for Cr, Cu, and Ni respectively.	2
The identified genera and species that may drive the observed plasticity included variations in Prevotella, Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae_unclassified, and Bifidobacterium at the genus level and Bacteroides dorei, @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$, Bacteroides plebeius, Bacteroides massiliensis, Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Eubacterium rectale at the species level. Many of these microbial species were reported to be correlated with immunity modulation. For instance, Bacteroides dorei was reported to be depleted in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and the gavage of B. dorei could attenuate atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice, notably ameliorating endotoxemia followed by decreasing gut microbial @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ production, effectively suppressing pro-inflammatory immune responses. In addition, @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ was reported to produce indole-3-acetic acid that promoted IL-22 production by immune cells, yielding beneficial effects on colitis.	1
The improved prognosis of colon cancer can be attributed to specific mucosal biota, namely @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ and Ruminococcus gnavus. These microorganisms play a pivotal role by producing metabolites that encompass a spectrum of fatty acid species, including medium chain (MCFAs), long-chain (LCFAs), and very long-chain (VLCFAs) fatty acids, alongside @sm$ ceramides @/sm$ and lysophospholipids.	1
The in vivo therapeutic effect of @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ and florfenicol was evaluated in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) infected with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$. For fish infected with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$, 2.5 or 10 mg/kg florfenicol and/or 10 mg/kg @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ were used to control the bacterial infection. The results showed that the synergy of @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ and florfenicol significantly reduced the bacterial load in all three tissues (p < 0.05). Compared with the untreated group, the bacterial load in the fish liver of 2.5 or 10 mg/kg florfenicol plus 10 mg/kg @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ was reduced by 5.3- and 16.8-fold, respectively (Figure 4A). In spleen tissue, the bacterial load was significantly reduced by about 13.9- and 105.7-fold in the two combination groups, respectively (Figure 4B). In kidney tissue, the bacterial load was significantly reduced by about 138.0- and 610.6-fold in the two combination groups, respectively (Figure 4C). In particular, we found that the bacterial load in the 10 mg/kg @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ plus 2.5 mg/kg florfenicol group was lower than that in the 10 mg/kg florfenicol group in all three tissues (p < 0.05). However, with 2.5 or 10 mg/kg florfenicol or 10 mg/kg @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ treatment alone, there were no significant changes in bacterial load, except for the treatment with 10 mg/kg florfenicol in spleen tissue. That is to say that @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ could strengthen the ability of florfenicol to eradicate bacteria and reduce the use of florfenicol by at least four-fold under the same or an even better therapeutic effect (Figure 4). The above results showed that @sm$ quercetin @/sm$ and florfenicol have obvious synergistic activity in vivo.	3
The induction of T3SS-1-dependent inflammatory responses during @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ colitis is largely MyD88-independent . One MyD88-independent mechanism by which @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ induces NF-kappaB activation is the induction of nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (Nod) 1 and Nod2, two cytosolic PRRs that sense cell wall fragments . Nod1 and Nod2 interact with the protein kinase receptor interacting protein-2 (Rip2) to mediate NF-kappaB activation . Remarkably, treatment of HEK293 cells with @sm$ SB203580 @/sm$, a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of Rip2 activity (Fig. S2G), significantly (P < 0.05) reduced NF-kappaB activation elicited by bacterial delivery of SopE (i.e. infection with sipA sopB sopE2 mutant) (Fig. 1A). In this model, no SopE-independent NF-kappaB activation was observed when cells were infected with non-flagellated @gm$ S. Typhimurium @/gm$ strains (Fig.	3
The infection status of the rabbits receiving PLNs was determined by orchitis development, seroconversion (RPR and TPPA) and microscopic observation of @sm$ silver @/sm$ stained-treponemes in testicular aspirates. Two PBS control naive recipient rabbits (R-Ct1 and R-Ct2) developed overt orchitis and stronger seroconversion (1:8 RPR titer and positive TPPA) on day 40 and day 56 post transfer ( Table S1 ), respectively. @sm$ Silver @/sm$-stained treponemes under microscopy in the concentrated testicular extracts from R-Ct1 and R-Ct2 also were observed ( Figure S1A ). Conversely, two naive PLN recipients from the Tp0954/FA-immunized rabbits (R-Im1 and R-Im2) developed neither orchitis nor seroconversion ( Table S1 ). Moreover, no treponemes were observed in testicular exudates by @sm$ silver @/sm$ staining 100 days after transfer ( Figure S1B ). All the findings suggest that rTp0954 vaccination prevents @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ dissemination in rabbits.	0
The intratumoral injection enhanced phagocytosis and NK cell like function however, intravenous injection exhibited increased @sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$ induced TNFalpha and lipoteichoic acid induced IL-10 production. A sustained increase in phagocytic and NK cell function indicated long term immune cell function changes which can possibly have association with tumor remission. @gm$ Enterococcus hirae @/gm$ and Barnesiella intestinihominis enhanced the immunomodulatory effects of cyclophosphamide by elevated CD8/T-reg ratio and promotion of interferon infiltration, respectively.	0
The isolate Kp10 (@gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$) was susceptible to a gram-negative antibiotic (nalidixic acid) and aminoglycosides (@sm$ amikacin @/sm$, kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin). In contrast, Zhou et al. and Temmerman et al. reported that most Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ strains used as probiotics are resistant to gram-negative and aminoglycoside antibiotics.	3
The luc-ldh reporter strain of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$, S. gordonii ATCC-10558, and S. sanguis ATCC-49295 were cultured anaerobically overnight in BHI liquid medium. After that the medium was diluted (1:20) in fresh BHI and cultured anaerobically for 2.5 h to reach the mid-logarithmic growth phase, and then the concentration was adjusted to 1x107 CFU/ml. BHI medium for the luc-ldh reporter strain of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ contained 0.5% sucrose, BHI medium for S. gordonii ATCC-10558 and S. sanguis ATCC-49295 contained 0.5% @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and mannose, respectively. Bacteria were transferred to a 96-well plate with 200 microl for each well, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4,000 x g. Biofilm was formed after anaerobic culture was carried out for 4 h at 37 C. The supernatant was discarded, and 100 microl PBS containing diluted peptide was added to the final concentration of 128 microg/ml. The supernatant was then removed, and 200 microl fresh BHI culture medium containing diluted residue peptide was added, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,390 x g. Subsequently, 200 microl fresh BHI medium containing sugar was added, followed by anaerobic cultivation at 37 C for 5,10,60 and 120 min, respectively, to measure OD600 values to detect biofilm growth. Then 50 microl of 1 mM D-luciferin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) was added, and the growth of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ was detected using a luminous RLU detection analyzer.	2
The main findings reveal that those with MUO have a lower abundance of Bacteroides, Bacteroides uniformis, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ compared to both healthy individuals without obesity and compared to those with MHO. These bacteria have essential functions in metabolic health, which may explain these distinctions. Bacteroides is a genus of anaerobic, non-spore-forming, bile-resistant, gram-negative rods and includes over 30 species of bacteria. Of all gram-negative bacteria, it is the most abundant one colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract. Bacteroides has been demonstrated to enhance host immunity, conserve microecological balance in the gut, and speed up angiogenesis in the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, some research has shown that more Bacteroides in the gastrointestinal tract could reduce obesity risk. Bacteroides uniformis, a type of Bacteroides, exhibits significant glycolytic capability, and it can adapt to various gut environments. Low levels of Bacteroides uniformis have been associated with obesity risk and, by potentially limiting the biosynthesis of @sm$ lipopolysaccharides @/sm$, which promote pro-inflammatory cytokines, Bacteroides uniformis could help alleviate inflammation. @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ belongs to the Bifidobacterium genus, which has been positively associated with host health, including demonstrations of preventing and/or treating colorectal cancer, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.	1
The majority of @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ strains in our study expressed @sm$ carbapenem @/sm$ resistance due to carriage of blaKPC.	4
The majority of proteins and OTUs belonged to @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ species. Treponema bryantii is known to interact with cellulolytic bacteria (Stanton and Canale-Parola,) and @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ is able to ferment @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ (Cwyk and Canale-Parola,) which may explain the increased abundance throughout the SP fractions. Comparably, the low abundant phylum of Synergistetes, characterized in 2009, revealed the highest LFQ-values of proteins and particularly OTUs in the SP fractions (Table S2). There is not much information about the members of this phylum that are present in many anaerobic ecosystems including the gastrointestinal tract of animals but usually appear in low abundance within the respective environments (Jumas-Bilak and Marchandin,). Synergistes jonesii was first isolated from the rumen of goat and did not ferment @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ but is thought to be involved in the degradation of plant-derived toxins such as mimosine and thus, might be beneficial for the host animal (Allison et al.,).	2
The metabolic pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds derived from lignin harbor a total of 12 subsystems (quinate degradation, benzoate degradation, 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation, hydroxyaromatic decarboxylase family, catechol pathway, protocatechuate pathway, @sm$ 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid @/sm$ catabolic pathway, central meta-cleavage pathway, salicylate, and gentisate catabolism, gentisate degradation, aromatic amine catabolism, and lignin degradation fragments) in @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1. We found an apparent contradiction among genotype and phenotype. Even when growing in lignin as the sole carbon source, some of the subsystems in the genome of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ P1CD1 were incomplete.	2
The methanol, chloroform, @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$ and aqueous bark extracts of Moringa oleifera were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against four bacteria viz. Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas fluorescens using erythromycin as positive control. The activity was analyzed using paper disc diffusion method at different concentration of the extract. The study revealed that all the bark extracts irrespective of their types, in different concentrations inhibited growth of the test pathogens to varying degrees. @sm$ Ethyl acetate @/sm$ extract showed maximum activity against all the bacterial strains followed in descending order by chloroform, methanol and aqueous extracts.	3
The most prevalent were @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ (21.5%) and S. sanguis (16.3%). @sm$ Imipenem @/sm$ and vancomycin had excellent activities. Resistance rates to trimethoprim, amoxicillin, piperacillin, erythromycin, cefuroxime and cephalothin, were 60.7, 40.8, 34.7, 32.6, 27.5 and 25.3%, respectively. Resistance rates to penicillin and clindamycin were 15.9% and 15.4%, respectively. The majority of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were from the tongue; 41% versus 29%. At the species level, 26% and 23% of @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ and 23% and 14% of S.	3
The objective of this study was to compare the antibacterial effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extracts (water, methanol, @sm$ acetone @/sm$, and ethyl acetate), sodium hypochlorite, acetic acid, and colloidal silver against foodborne bacteria on leafy greens. Thirteen foodborne bacteria were used in the study: Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella serotypes Typhimurium Typhi, and Montevideo, Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$, five E.	3
The optimal M3S subset for osteoporosis identification included @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$, Veillonella, Intestinibacter, 9E-tetradecenoic acid, and Suberic acid. The optimal M3S subset for osteoporosis subtype recognition included cg22026953, cg18008345, cg21813369, cg11070274, cg00329101, cg23088318, cg15508935, cg09656629, cg15320980, cg00431894, cg18243574, @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$, Streptococcus, Veillonella, @sm$ Threonic acid @/sm$, and 5Z-Dodecenoic acid.	0
The patient described here received @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ treatment several times but always had a relapse of C. difficile enterocolitis 2-3 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. She did not form serum antibodies to @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ cytotoxin (toxin B).	3
The phylogeny of PleB, the MacB-like transporter that is part of a dedicated ATP-dependent tripartite efflux system driving export of Pseudomonas LPs, revealed a strong correlation with @sm$ LP @/sm$ chemical diversity. As each @sm$ LP @/sm$ BGC carries its cognate pleB, PleB is suitable as a diagnostic sequence for genome mining, allowing assignment of the putative metabolite to a particular @sm$ LP @/sm$ family. In addition, pleB proved to be a suitable target gene for an alternative PCR method for detecting @sm$ LP @/sm$-producing Pseudomonas sp. and did not rely on amplification of catalytic domains of the biosynthetic enzymes. Combined with amplicon sequencing, this approach enabled typing of Pseudomonas strains as potential producers of a @sm$ LP @/sm$ belonging to one of the known @sm$ LP @/sm$ families, underscoring its value for strain prioritization. This finding was validated by chemical characterization of known LPs from three different families secreted by novel producers isolated from the rice or maize rhizosphere, namely, the type strains of @gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$ (putisolvin), Pseudomonas zeae (tensin), and Pseudomonas xantholysinigenes (xantholysin).	1
The possible participation of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and/or mannose in intracellular listerial metabolism is difficult to demonstrate experimentally, since @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ possess a large number of PEP-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS) and even non-PTS transporters for @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and mannose (Glaser et al.,; Stoll and Goebel,; Ake et al.,).	2
The potential to digest the coarse feed into metabolic energy in rumen is entirely attributed to its @sm$ polysaccharide @/sm$ degrading enzymes. Rumen fluid due to its complex lignocellulosic degradation system is thus an excellent sample for mining CAZymes. In our study, oligosaccharide degrading enzymes were the most abundant of the total glycoside hydrolases. The higher occurrence of this category is justified due to their action on large number of oligosaccharides byproducts generated after initial breakdown of the complex @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ like cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Among the GHs, GH2 that corresponds for glucuronidase and GH3 corresponding for L-arabinofuranisidase, B-D-glucosidase and B-D-xylopyranosidase activities were the most abundant. The major source for GH3 is known to be @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ genus and hence we could observe that the proportion of GH3 encoding sequences decreased in the DL samples from J1 to J3 in correspondence to the decrease in @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ population as seen from the genus level classification of organisms encoding the GH genes.	2
The presence of external lactate or lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ in the medium was a stimulating factor for the growth of butyrate producers (Experiments ML, MLA and SLA). Lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ are also fermentation products. Our results clearly show that the balance between lactic acid bacteria and butyrate producers is key for the conversion of lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ to butyrate. DF MCs that the most effectively converted lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ to butyrate (Experiments SLA and MLA) were composed of Clostridium sensu stricto 12, Lactobacillus, Fructobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Prevotella. A summary of the batch experiments where lactate and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ were transformed to butyrate clearly shows a significant consumption of lactate (or its low concentration) among the non-gaseous products despite the presence of lactic acid bacteria in the MCs.	2
The present study aimed to detect the presence of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. in stools of outpatients with diarrhea attended by clinical laboratories in Santa Maria/RS, motivated by low number of studies regarding this pathogen in the region. Were analyzed 182 diarrheal stool samples collected in the period of June/2010 to May/2011. The samples were inoculated in Alkaline Peptone Water (Himedia, Mumbai, India) and incubated for 24 hours at 25 C. Then, an aliquot of the culture was inoculated in Nutrient Agar (Himedia, Mumbai, India) and incubated for 24 hours at 37 C. Four isolated colonies of each culture were analyzed by Gram staining and cytochrome oxidase test (Laborclin, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). Suspect colonies, i.e. gram-negative bacilli cytochrome oxidase positive, were tested for reactions used for @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. identification: production of catalase, arginine dihidrolase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylase, citrate, production of gas from glucose, fermentation of D-adonitol, L-arabinose, L-dextrose, L-dulcitol, m-inositol, lactose, D-mannitol, mannose, @sm$ raffinose @/sm$, L-rhamnose, D-sorbitol, sucrose and D-trehalose, production of indole, motility, Voges-Proskauer and aesculin hydrolysis.	2
The production of @sm$ H2S @/sm$ is complex and involves different enzymatic pathways for different bacterial species and strains. The literature on this subject is rather sparse as opposed to the production of eukaryotic cells, where @sm$ H2S @/sm$ is produced by three PLP dependent enzymes; cystathionine beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, that use L-cysteine as their principle substrate. The bacterial production of @sm$ H2S @/sm$ is mainly due to the degradation of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine and results in different metabolic end products depending on the enzymes participating. One common cysteine degradation pathway involves the PLP dependent L-cysteine desulfhydrases, including alpha, beta-elimination activity, that results in the production of @sm$ H2S @/sm$, pyruvate and ammonia. L-cysteine desulfhydrases have been identified in many oral bacterial species and are known to be encoded by the cdl gene in F. nucleatum, the hly gene in T. denticola and the lcs gene in P. intermedia. Moreover, @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ and S. intermedius are capable to produce @sm$ H2S @/sm$ from L-cysteine using a cystathionase, encoded by the lcd gene, that uses L-cystathionine as well as cysteine as substrate. In the current study, the in-gel activity assay for detection of @sm$ H2S @/sm$-producing enzymes revealed a variety of enzymes with molecular weights between 30 and 50 kDa in F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum and F. periodonticum. The sizes of these enzymes are in line with the desulfhydrases previously reported for F. nucleatum ATCC 25586; 33 kDa (Fn1220, cdl), 37 kDa (Fn1055), 43 kDa (Fn1419) and 47 kDa (Fn0625). It is therefore tempting to suggest that similar desulfhydrases are also involved in @sm$ H2S @/sm$-production in F.	1
The propionate-CoA transferase (pct) gene from @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ and the beta-ketothiolase (bktB) gene and phaCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha H16 were introduced into E. coli JM109. A novel monomer containing a hydroxyl group, dihydroxybutyrate (DHBA), was the expected product of the condensation of glycolyl-CoA and @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ by BktB. The recombinant strain produced a PHA containing 1 mol% DHBA. The incorporation of DHBA may have been restricted because the expression of phaAB1 competes for @sm$ acetyl-CoA. @/sm$ The PHA containing DHBA units were evaluated regarding thermal properties, such as melting temperature, glass transition temperature and thermal degradation temperature.	2
The protein was phosphorylated in vitro in a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent manner by purified enzyme I (EI) from @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$, and much less efficiently in an ATP-dependent manner by purified HPr kinase, also from @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$. There was no indication of ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the purified protein by cell extracts of either S. coelicolor or Streptomyces lividans. Deletion of the ptsH homologue from the S. coelicolor and S. lividans chromosomes had no effect on growth when @sm$ fructose @/sm$ was supplied as sole carbon source, and in S. coelicolor it had no effect on glucose repression of agarase and galactokinase synthesis, suggesting that the HPr encoded by this gene does not play an essential role in @sm$ fructose @/sm$ transport nor a general role in carbon catabolite repression.	2
The protocol included a one-week control period and two weeks of treatment with @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ R0052 and B. longum R0175. Ammonia (NH4+), short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), @sm$ gamma-aminobutyric acid @/sm$ (@sm$ GABA @/sm$), cytokines and microbiota composition were determined. Probiotic strains decreased significantly throughout the gastric phase. The highest survival rates were exhibited by @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ R0052 (81.58%; 77.22%) after the gastric and intestinal phase when compared to B. longum (68.80%; 64.64%). At the genus level, a taxonomic assignment performed in the ascending colon in the SHIME  model showed that probiotics (7 and 14 days) significantly (p < 0.005) increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Olsenella and significantly decreased Lachnospira and Escheria-Shigella. The probiotic treatment (7 and 14 days) decreased (p < 0.001) NH4+ production when compared to the control period. For SCFAs, we observed after probiotic treatment (14 days) an increase (p < 0.001) in acetic acid production and total SCFAs when compared to the control period. Probiotic treatment increased (p < 0.001) the secretion of anti-inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-10) and decreased (p < 0.001) pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) when compared to the control period. The gut-brain axis plays an important role in the gut microbiota, producing SCFAs and @sm$ GABA @/sm$, stimulating the production of anti-anxiety homeostasis.	1
The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific effects of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) using @sm$ erythrosine @/sm$ (@sm$ ER @/sm$) and Rose Bengal (RB) photosensitizers and a blue light-emitting diode (LED) on the viability of @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ and Streptococcus sanguinis biofilms. Biofilms were grown in acrylic disks immersed in broth to production of biofilms, inoculated with microbial suspension (10(6) cells/mL) and incubated for 48 h. After the formation of biofilms, the effects of the photosensitizers @sm$ ER @/sm$ and RB at a concentration of 5 muM for 5 min and blue LED (455 +- 20 nm) for 180 s, photosensitizers alone and conjugated were evaluated. Next, the disks were placed in tubes with sterile physiological solution (0.9 % sodium chloride) and sonicated for to disperse the biofilms. Tenfold serial dilutions were carried and aliquots seeded in brain heart infusion agar which were then incubated for 48 h. Then the numbers colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL; log10) were counted and analyzed statistically (ANOVA, Tukey test, P <= 0.05). Significant decreases in the viability of all microorganisms were observed for biofilms exposed to PDI mediated by both photosensitizers. The reductions with RB and @sm$ ER @/sm$ were, 0.62 and 0.52 log10 CFU mL(-1) for @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ biofilms (p=0.001), and 0.95 and 0.88 log10 CFU mL(-1) for S. sanguinis biofilms (p=0.001), respectively. The results showed that biofilms formed in vitro by @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ and S. sanguinis, were sensitive to PDI using a blue LED associated with photosensitizers @sm$ ER @/sm$ or RB, indicating its use in the control of caries and periodontal diseases.	3
The reported SMRs were not adjusted for known risk factors such as chronic infection with @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$, smoking and diet habits., for example, report that their finding of no trend of lung cancer with exposure up to 300 mpcf.y suggests that the 21% excess was due to some other factor, probably smoking, and that the effect of smoking on stomach cancer was twice as high as the effect of >300 mpcf.y. A recent study found statistically significant increased hazard ratios for gastric cancer and several @sm$ asbestos @/sm$ exposure variables, adjusted for age and family history of gastric cancer, although, with the exception of long duration at high exposure, these associations tended to disappear after adjusting for smoking.	0
The response surface of AD interaction (pH and @sm$ glucose @/sm$) showed that in a medium level of pH and @sm$ glucose @/sm$ concentration the highest level of oxalate degradation achieved. Experts have previously shown that in vitro oxalate consumption and degradation is associated. Knowing this, it would be beneficial to maintain or improve the viability of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ oxalate degrading ability via @sm$ glucose @/sm$ sources in in vivo models to favor as well.	2
The results presented above show that @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ 513 converts malate to pyruvate via Mae, and oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate via PckA. Because these TCA cycle intermediates could be replenished by condensation of acetyl-CoA with glyoxylate into malate, we constructed an isocitrate lyase (AceA; Figure 1) mutant for in vivo studies (see below) on the role of the glyoxylate bypass. As expected, growth of this @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ 513 mutant was identical to that of the parental strain in peptone-yeast extract, and this mutation had no effect on the growth in glutamate-lactate-glycerol, glutamate-glycerol, or lactate-glycerol (results not shown). Similarly, growth was not affected in media containing peptones (not shown), even though acetogenic amino acids (leucine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) represent approximately 20% of the peptone amino acid content.	2
The species was identified as a member of the genus Dorea, based on a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 100.0% to @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ and 95.4% to the type species of this genus, D. formicigeneransT. This is supported by POCP values of 74.8% and 62.3%, respectively. While the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity suggests this isolate is a strain of @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$, the ANI value between these genomes was 91.2%, suggesting it as a novel species. GTDB-Tk identified the isolate as 'Dorea longicatena_B'. This is due to the need to split @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ into two distinct species based on genomic comparison. Separation from the species 'D. acetigenes' and 'D. ammoniilytica' was confirmed via an ANI values of 85.7% and 80.6%, respectively, between the genomes of the type strains. Within the genome, 160 CAZymes were identified along with the predicted utilisation of @sm$ glucose @/sm$, arbutin, salicin, trehalose and starch as carbon sources.	2
The strain considered in the study is @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ Group I type A1 strain ATCC 19397 (NCTC 7272). It is a typical @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ Group I type A1 strain with the bont gene in an ha neurotoxin gene cluster (Carter et al.; Carter and Peck). Strain ATCC 19397 was grown in anaerobic (@sm$ N2 @/sm$/CO2/H2; 85:5:10) peptone-yeast-glucose-starch medium at 37 C (Sharma; Peck).	3
The tests are: antibiotic-disk resistance tests with neomycin 1000 micrograms, kanamycin 1000 micrograms, penicillin 2 units and rifampicin 15 micrograms per disk; tolerance tests with sodium taurocholate, Victoria blue 4R and gentian violet; and tests for pigment production, indole production, aesculin hydrolysis and the fermentation of @sm$ glucose @/sm$, lactose, sucrose, rhamnose, trehalose, mannitol and xylose. Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli are divided into four groups: (1) the fragilis group with nine species, which include the five subgroups previously classified as subspecies of B. fragilis; (2) the melaninogenicus-oralis group, which includes the three saccharolytic subspecies (ss.) of B. melaninogenicus--ss. melaninogenicus, ss. intermedius and ss. levii--and four non-pigmented species; (3) the asaccharolytic group, which comprises @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$ (formerly B.	2
There is evidence that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is affected by gut microbiota, @sm$ glucose @/sm$, and lipid. However, the function of water-electrolyte metabolism remains undefined in children with NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this case-control study was to better understand these interactions. The sample consisted of 75 children, aged between 7 and 16, of whom 25 had nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), 25 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 25 were obese and without NAFLD. These groups were matched by age, sex, and body mass index. Data were collected between June, 2019 and December, 2019 at the Hunan Children's Hospital, in China. Microbiome composition in fecal samples was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. In the clinical indices, 12 @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and lipid metabolism indices were included, and six water-electrolyte metabolism indices were included. The results indicated that microbiomes of NAFLD children had lower alpha diversity but higher beta diversity index than the other two groups. Specifically, anti-inflammatory and probiotics abundance (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium_adolescentis) was significantly decreased in NAFLD, whereas the abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcaceae) was increased. Moreover, the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Roseburia_inulinivorans, Roseburia_intestinalis, and @gm$ Coprococcus_comes @/gm$) was significantly decreased in NASH. The abundance of these bacteria were associated with @sm$ glucose @/sm$, lipid, and water-electrolyte metabolism (e.g., @sm$ glucose @/sm$, triglyceride, cholesterol, inorganic salt, total body water, etc.), implying that the NAFLD and its severity were associated with @sm$ glucose @/sm$, lipid, and water-electrolyte metabolism dysbiosis.	2
These findings revealed that three butyrate-producing bacterial strains: @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ MRx0029, Roseburia intestinalis MRx0071, and Bariatricus massiliensis MRx1342, manifested the highest inhibition of HDAC activity. In addition, M. massiliensis produced significant levels of valeric acid and @sm$ hexanoic acid @/sm$, which are medium-chain fatty acids.	1
These microbes convert carbohydrates such as fructose, maltose, lactose and @sm$ galactose @/sm$ to acetate and ethanol. Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis can carry out both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Under anaerobic conditions, B. cereus ferments glucose to a mixture of acetate, lactate and ethanol, while B. thuringiensis produces mostly lactate. Streptococcus pneumonia is a pathogen that converts glucose to lactate. Its relative @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ can ferment glucose, lactose, maltose and trehalose to a mixture of volatile fatty acids, while S.	2
They are a source of energy for intestinal epithelial cells, which can maintain the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and reduce intestinal permeability and levels of circulating @sm$ lipopolysaccharides @/sm$, thereby promoting the body to achieve a healthy state. Studies have shown that Peptostreptococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Roseburia, Romboutsia, Lachnospira, Odoribacter, @gm$ E. ventriosum @/gm$, Oscillibacter, and other biological flora can produce SCFAs and maintain a healthy intestinal microecological environment.	1
They are the derivatives of gut microbiota formed by the intestinal microbial fermentation and degradation of dietary fibers and @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$. SCFAs are involved in maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity, controlling glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism, and regulating the immune system and inflammatory responses based on multiple pathways, such as the G protein-coupled receptor family, and epigenetic modification by acting as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Most acetates and propionates are mainly derived from the gut microbiota of phylum Bacteroidetes, such as species @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Eubacterium hallii, and Eubacterium cylindroides, whereas phylum Firmicutes, the main producers of butyrate, includes species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, and Ruminococcus gnavus.	1
They mainly include the following genera: Lactobacillus, @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weisella. A common feature of all LAB is the ability to anaerobically metabolize a number of sugars via fermentation (depending on the species/strains). The main product of this process is @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, which has preservative properties and contributes to the inhibition of the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. Homofermentative bacteria, such as those belonging to the Lactoccocus or Streptococcus genera, produce this acid via the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway. In contrast, heterofermentative LAB strains (Weissella, Leuconostoc, and certain Lactobacillus), in addition to @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, can also produce acetic acid, ethanol, carbon dioxide, or acetate through the phosphoketolase pathways. Depending on inter alia temperature and the strain used, the amount of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ produced may vary from a few to over 200 g per liter of medium. @sm$ Lactic acid @/sm$ neutralizes the electrochemical potential of cell membranes and denaturates the intracellular proteins of microorganisms by lowering the pH of the environment, which limits the growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. In addition, the beneficial changes that take place in the host's body under the influence of probiotics include an increase in the number of positive intestinal microflora. The antimicrobial activity of probiotic strains also results from their ability to form biofilms on the gut wall, compete for nutrients, and produce or release various metabolites (@sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, antimicrobial peptides, short-chain fatty acids, and hydrogen peroxide).	1
They used thin silver films on a @sm$ silicon @/sm$ platform along with T4 phages. The reported limit of detection of E. coli was 1.5 x 102 CFU/mL. Recently, Rippa et al. developed a substrate made of plasmonic nanocavities, with a layer of immobilized bacteriophages. The authors suggested that the proposed system constitutes a novel solution for the specific detection of different species of bacteria. The same group successfully used other metastructures, appropriately functionalized with Tbilisi bacteriophages, for @gm$ Brucella @/gm$'s SERS-based detection.	0
Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant @sm$ starch @/sm$ degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, and Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria.	2
This altered microbiota is termed dysbiosis, and in comparison with the microbiota of healthy individuals, the abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ is enriched, and Bifidobacteria and Faecalibacteria are depleted in patients with hyperuricemia. Animal studies have reported some certain beneficial bacteria, including SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids)-producing bacteria (e.g., Clostridium and Ruminococcaceae), which are decreased in hyperuricemic animal models. Emerging literature suggested that gut dysbiosis not only leaded to bacteria or bacterial products translocation such as @sm$ LPS @/sm$ (@sm$ lipopolysaccharide @/sm$), but also resulted in increased intestinal permeability in hyperuricemia.	1
This difference in recognition patterns can be seen in the human STING structure bound to 2'3'-cGAMP (i.e., PDB code 7SII) and in several @sm$ cdiGMP @/sm$-bound bacterial STING crystal structures such as @gm$ Sphingobacterium faecium @/gm$ STING (PDB code 7UN9), Myroides sp.	3
This microbiota has many essential roles in human health: it suppresses proliferation of pathogenic microbes and has important nutritional consequences, including vitamin synthesis and fermentation of complex dietary @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$. Microbial metabolites also regulate the signaling activities of the host's intestinal epithelium, which, for example, aids the development and maintenance of local immune responses. Thus, considerable efforts are now being made to determine the precise nature of the dialog between gut bacteria and the human host. Much of the previous work in this area has focused on the roles of diffusible, small-molecule hormones and nutrients. We now describe a vehicle produced by a prevalent gut bacterium, @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ (@gm$ Bt @/gm$): a vesicle-enclosed homolog of a mammalian cell-signaling InsP6 phosphatase, MINPP.	1
This research aims to explore the structural and antioxidant properties of the EPS from @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$, a probiotics widely existed in human and animal intestines. EPS of C. butyricum RO-07 was purified through a combination of anion-exchange column chromatography and gel chromatography and determined to be composed of glucosamine, arabinose, @sm$ galactosamine @/sm$, galactose, glucose, and xylose in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:2:1:1 with a molecular weight 1.23 x 104  Da.	1
This research was to explore antibiotic-induced drug resistance of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ and its biofilm formation mechanism. Kirby-Bauer (K-B) disk method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) was used to test drug sensitivity of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ to 16 kinds of antibiotics including ss-lactams, @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, quinolones, sulfonamides, chloramphenicols, and tetracyclines. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect carrying of drug resistance genes of 29 kinds of antibiotics including ss-lactams, @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, quinolones, sulfonamides, chloramphenicols, and tetracyclines of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$. The expressions of esp, ebpA, ge1E, and fsrB genes in biofilm group and plankton group were detected when @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ was induced, and difference of gene expression was detected by FQ-PCR. The drug resistance rates of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, streptomyces, and cefoperazone were high, which were 94.5%, 75%, 67%, and 52%, respectively. 94 strains of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ formed 22 kinds of drug resistance spectrum, the strains were generally resistant to 4-5 antibiotics, and some strains formed fixed drug resistance spectrum as follows: AMP-CFP-STR-NA-TE (22.6,21.7%), AMP-STR-NA-TE (17,16%), and AMP-CFP-STR-NA (11.1,10.6%). During biofilm formation, fsr can increase expression of ge1E and decrease expression of esp and ebpA. Consequently, @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ was generally resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, and streptomycin, and the multidrug resistance was severe. The drug resistance genes sul2, sul3, blaTEM-1-like, tet(A), and tet(G) were highly carried in @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$. Esp, ebpA, ge1E, and fsrB genes were closely related to biofilm formation of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$.	4
This study was undertaken to determine whether the suspected periodontopathogens Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss melaninogenicus and intermedius and @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$ are killed by clinically used topical @sm$ fluorides @/sm$. The viability of each organism was examined after exposure to three @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ compounds, stannous (SnF2), acidulated phosphate (APF), and neutral sodium (NaF), for 1 and 8 h. Stannous fluoride was found to be effective at lowest @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ concentrations with APF next in effectiveness. NaF required the highest concentrations of @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ to kill test organisms. Longer exposure times were found to be more effective at lower concentrations. Data obtained in this study with gram-negative organisms support and extend previous information regarding the antibacterial effect of @sm$ fluorides @/sm$ against gram-positive periodontopathogens.	3
This suggests that efficacy may depend more on the molecular mechanisms of suppression involved (see below), like interference with quorum sensing by HAMA and/or disruption of cell membrane function by @sm$ gallic acid @/sm$. The most WH-sensitive ones tested were Staphylococci (including MRSA) and Enterococci, followed by Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, @gm$ Escherichia @/gm$, Pseudomonas, and streptococci.	3
Three potential rhizobacteria namely @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ (MTCC 10216), Pseudomonas sp. (MTCC 9002) and Bacillus subtilis (MTCC 8528) procured from IMTECH, Chandigarh (India) were evaluated individually and as consortia for its phosphate (@sm$ P) @/sm$ solubilizing ability and effect of growth of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.). Phosphate solubilizing ability of these strains individually and as consortia was tested on Pikovskayas agar medium, Phosphate solubilizing agar medium and National Botanical Research Institute phosphate agar medium containing six different sources of insoluble inorganic phosphate such as tri-calcium phosphate (TCP), di-calcium phosphate (DCP), zinc phosphate (ZP), ferric phosphate (FP), sodium di-hydrogen phosphate (SP), and aluminum phosphate (AP), and two organic @sm$ P @/sm$ such as calcium and sodium phytate. The maximum @sm$ P @/sm$ solubilizing ability was recorded in consortium-4 having all three potential bacterial strains. Phosphate solubilization after 7th day of incubation was 37.9 mg/100 ml of TCP, 40.01 mg/100 ml of DCP, 15.79 mg/100 ml of FP, 43.02 mg/100 ml of SP, no solubilization of ZP and AP, 39.75 mg/100 ml of calcium phytate and 24.01mg/100 ml of sodium phytate. Seed germination and the other plant parameters such as plant height and weight significantly increased in fenugreek and tomato seeds, bio-primed with consortium-4 followed by consortium-3. After bio-priming of seeds in pot assay, the level of @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ in soil got increased by 54% in consortium-4 treated soil followed by consortium-3 (47%) over untreated control soil.	1
To allow visualisation by electron microscopy, S-layers were either removed from @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ cells in a single piece following peptidoglycan digestion (S-layer ghosts) or cells were mechanically fragmented (S-layer/cell wall fragments). @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to an OD600nm of 10 in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM sucrose. For S-layer ghosts, cell walls were digested using purified phiCD27 endolysin for 30 min at 37  C. The resulting membrane-bound spheroplasts were removed from the sample by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 2 min and the supernatant, containing S-layer ghosts, was retained for imaging. 5 mul of S-layer ghosts were loaded on glow-discharged, amorphous @sm$ carbon @/sm$-coated 300 mesh copper EM grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate, as previously described.	0
To date, several publications have reported the anti-oxidant capacity of @sm$ alpha-asarone @/sm$, @sm$ beta-asarone @/sm$, and isoshyobunone, calacorene, and isocalamendiol are essential oils with anti-oxidant activity. @sm$ gamma-asarone @/sm$ shows fungitoxicity against Aspergillus flavus. delta-Cadinene in Psidium cattleianum Sabine has anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activities. The volatile oil of ATR has a good inhibitory effect on staphylococcus epidermidis, group A streptococcus and shigella flexneri. Qiu et al., found that the microwave water extract of ATR has effective anti-bacterial components. The microwave water extract of ATR has obvious anti-bacterial effect on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. Secondly, it has a certain inhibitory effect on @gm$ salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhi, acinetobacter, shigella flexneri and escherichia coli. In addition, @sm$ alpha-asarone @/sm$ could regulate the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and anti-oxidant activities.	3
To determine if the observed protection from ROS was strain dependent, the growth of the 2011 outbreak strain EAEC @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$, which sickened over 3,000 people in Europe (~50 deaths), was examined for growth when exposed to plumbagin and @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$. Indeed, EAEC was protected from ROS when @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ was added to the cultures (Fig. 2B). Similarly, E. coli BL21, a laboratory strain that is not considered a pathogen, was protected from ROS when supplemented with @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Further, E. coli isolated from a healthy donor's stool sample were likewise tested and found to be protected from ROS when cultured with @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ (Fig. 2D). Each of the strains displayed varying susceptibilities towards the toxic effects of plumbagin, possibly from differential regulation of ROS neutralizing factors. Yet, in each experiment, the addition of @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ decreased the amount of toxicity generated by plumbagin, suggesting @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ could act as an antioxidant for each strain. Finally, to strengthen the notion that @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ was relieving oxidant stress generated by plumbagin, we repeated the above experiments with EHEC using a photosensitive ROS-generating agent called Rose Bengal, which generates superoxide from molecular oxygen under fluorescent lighting. Growth of EHEC strain 86-24 was inhibited in a light-dependent manner with Rose Bengal present, yet growth was rescued when increasing amounts of @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ were supplemented into the cultures (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results strengthen the notion that @sm$ bilirubin @/sm$ protects diverse strains of E.	3
To further investigate the functional and metabolic diversity across TS-1, TS-2 and @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, we characterised the pangenome across these three species using the UniRef and eggNOG databases. Focusing on genes that can be characterised with KEGG orthology, we identified 227 genes that are present in all TS-1 genomes but absent in the other two species. For TS-2 and @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, we also found 129 and 98 such species-specific genes, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S14, Additional file 2: Tables S14-S16). From these species-specific genes, we next sought to identify the ones that also had a unique KEGG orthology (KO) and their respective metabolic pathways. We found 11 unique KOs in TS-1 and 10 in TS-2, and they are mostly involved in basic metabolisms (e.g. carbohydrate, energy and @sm$ lipid @/sm$ metabolisms), cellular and genetic information processing (Additional file 2: Table S17). Of note, we found only one KO unique to @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ and it could be related to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism or cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance (Additional file 2: Table S17).	2

To generate RG-specific monoclonal antibodies, 10 BALB/c mice were immunized by a vendor (Envigo) with an extract of the (the BEI strain CC55_001C), which we have termed the RG2 strain, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and then 14-days later boosted with @sm$ lipoglycan @/sm$ (LG) purified from the Lupus S47-18 strain emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, This strategy has been used in phage display selection of antibody clones with antigenic cross-reactivity of interest. The cells from the mouse with the strongest post-immunization response were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells. After subcloning, the spent supernatants after 7 days were evaluated for IgG-reactivity, which demonstrated highly correlated reactivity with whole extracts of the immunizing RG strain and then with RG @sm$ lipoglycan @/sm$, by the subcloned hybridoma cell line, termed mAb 36.2.2. By immunoblot, this mAb was reactive with oligo-bands that migrate in the same range as 20-30 kilodalton protein markers, and these bands also display equivalent Lupus serum IgG-reactivity with oligo-bands in the @sm$ lipoglycan @/sm$ producing RG strains, RG2, S107-48 and S47-18 while these bands are absent in the RG1 strain (Figure 1). Specificity was also confirmed by ELISA, when the plates were coated with bacterial extracts from RG2, S47-18, S107-48, S107-86, RG1, the purified @sm$ lipoglycan @/sm$ from RG2 and S47-18 as well as with @sm$ LPS @/sm$ from @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ as a control from other species.	1
To identify the particular steps in metabolic pathways that were inhibited by @sm$ fluoride @/sm$, metabolomic analysis of glucose metabolism in @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ in the presence/absence of @sm$ fluoride @/sm$ was performed using CE-TOFMS. After the addition of @sm$ fluoride @/sm$, the intracellular accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate in the bifid shunt and 3-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis was observed (Figure 4). On the contrary, the intracellular level of pyruvate was significantly decreased in the presence of @sm$ fluoride @/sm$.	3
To investigate biofilm formation of @gm$ K. ornithinolytica @/gm$, K. oxytoca and K. terrigena strains, modified method of Crystal Violet Binding Assay described by O'Toole, was used (O'Toole, 2011). In this method, Klebsiella species were sub-cultured into the Brain Heart Infusion Broth at 37 C overnight. After the incubation period, these cultures were diluted to the proportion of 1:100 and transferred into the 24-well @sm$ polystyrene @/sm$ plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 C.	0
Tryptic soy agar plates with 5% sheep blood (Remel Laboratories, Lenexus, KS) were used to grow the @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ isolates. The plates were incubated at 37oC and 42oC under microaerobic conditions in a vented jar containing @sm$ N2 @/sm$, H2, and CO2 (80:10:10) for 48 hours.	2
Twenty-five clinical isolates of @gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$ were examined for susceptibility to 14 antimicrobial drugs. In terms of inhibitory and bactericidal activities, imipenem and polymyxin B were most active, followed by amikacin and ceftazidime. Four isolates were resistant against fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin). The isolates varied in susceptibility to aztreonam, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, @sm$ mezlocillin @/sm$, netilmicin and piperacillin. Fresh defibrinated human blood from 3 donors revealed similar killing kinetics against 8 selected isolates. In time-kill curve experiments, human blood enhanced the activity of amikacin more than that of ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$.	3
Two @gm$ S. Paratyphi B var @/gm$. Java possessed both mcr-1 and mcr-9, suggesting that selective pressure by different antimicrobials could facilitate carriage of diverse mcr genes on a plasmid and that the German poultry industry constitutes a source for organisms capable of causing untreatable diseases. There was a chromate and ESBL gene in some of the mcr-5-harbouring salmonellae even in @sm$ tigecycline @/sm$-resistant isolates, 13 other resistance genes in five different antimicrobial families were in the mcr-3-positive Aeromonas whereas 18 extra resistance genes (including ESBL genes) were present in the mcr-1-positive isolates which were extensively diverse belonging to seven STs (dominated by ST156 and ST1431) (; Horseny et al., 2019) (Table 2), including HiR pandemic ExPEC clones ST69, ST131, ST410, ST10 and ST58.	4
Two isolates (0.3%), one Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the pus of infected post-operative wound and the other, @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ from the urine, were imipenem resistant, but did not show MBL production. Both these isolate do not show @sm$ AmpC @/sm$ beta-lactames production, but @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ indicated a positive reaction for Carbapenemas production by the Modified Hodge test and, therefore, these could be the KPC (@gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ Carbapenemas) strain.	4
UNLABELLED: For prevention of dental caries, @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ numbers must be reduced and prevented from returning to the original level. An antibacterial agent that is effective and also acceptable to young children can help to establish a favorable oral environment and halt the caries process. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of topical antimicrobial (10% @sm$ Povidone- Iodine @/sm$) on @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ counts in children with Early Childhood Caries after full mouth rehabilitation. Also its effects on the clinical outcomes in terms of incidence of new caries and secondary caries were evaluated. METHOD: Full mouth rehabilitation was done in 30 children (mean age 4.2 years) suffering from Severe Early Childhood Caries (SECC). Stimulated saliva samples were collected to determine the post operative baseline @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ counts. Thereafter the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received 10% @sm$ Povidone Iodine @/sm$ at 3 months interval for a period of 12 months while the control group received placebo (deionized water) at similar intervals. Change in the @gm$ S.mutans @/gm$ count at 6 and 12 month intervals were compared to the baseline post-operative mutans score. Results revealed that application of 10% @sm$ Povidone Iodine @/sm$ caused a significant reduction in the rise of @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ levels from the baseline postoperative score after 12 months of treatment thus decreasing the oral load of the organisms. Reduction in counts; in turn decreased the relapse of caries in these children. CONCLUSION: Thus oral rehabilitation coupled with regular application of 10% @sm$ Povidone Iodine @/sm$ application can be a good alternative to control dental caries in children affected with Early Childhood Caries (ECC).	3
Unlike humans, most animals produce little or no triglycerides in hair follicles to harbor @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ a fact that has encumbered the development of novel treatments for acne lesions. Although genetic mutant mice with acne-like skins have been used for screening anti-acne drugs, the mice generally have deficits in immune system that turns out to be inappropriate to generate antibodies for developing acne vaccines. Here, we employed a bioengineering approach using a tissue chamber integrated with a dermis-based cell-trapped system (DBCTS) to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of acne lesions. Human sebocyte cell lines were grown in DBCTS as a scaffold and inserted into a perforated tissue chamber. After implantation of a tissue chamber bearing human sebocytes into ICR mice, @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ or @sm$ PBS @/sm$ was injected into a tissue chamber to induce host immune response. Infiltrated cells such as neutrophils and macrophages were detectable in tissue chamber fluids. In addition, a proinflammatory cytokine macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) was elevated after @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ injection. In tissue chamber fluids, 13 proteins including secreted proteins and cell matrix derived from mouse, human cells or @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ were identified by proteomics using isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) coupled to nano-LC-MS analysis. After P. acnes infection, four proteins including fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide, fibrinogen beta chain, S100A9, and serine protease inhibitor A3K showed altered concentrations in the mimicked acne microenvironment. The bioengineered acne model thus provides an in vivo microenvironment to study the interaction of host with @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ and offers a unique set-up for screening novel anti-acne drugs and vaccines.	1
Urine PAG, PCS, and IS concentrations were highly correlated and had the highest contribution to the model followed by leucine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ (also highly correlated) and isobutyrate (figure 3B). PAG, PCS and IS were most correlated with @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$, Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Rothia and Holdemanella (figure 3C). Variables in this cluster also had a strong negative correlation with serum leucine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ and isobutyrate. Anaerostipes, the only genus that decreased in abundance in the MAL group, was negatively correlated with PAG, PCS and IS but positively correlated with leucine, @sm$ isoleucine @/sm$ and isobutyrate (figure 3C).	2
Vaccine strain @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis @/gm$ (S. Choleraesuis; S.C.) (ATCC 15480) was obtained from Bioresources Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Bacteria were maintained in L.B. plate and propagate in L.B. broth for using. Resveratrol (0-6mug/ml.), and DMSO were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Murine B16F10 cells were maintained in culture dish with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 1% @sm$ Penicillin @/sm$-Streptomycin (100 units/mL @sm$ penicillin @/sm$ and 100 mug/mL streptomycin), 2mM glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.	3
Vitamin E protects cells from @sm$ lipid @/sm$ peroxidation, is anti-inflammatory, and reduces scar formation. Numerous studies have shown that vitamins C and E exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including Staphylococcal species (including Staphylococcus aureus), Streptococcal species, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.	3
We also identified four species markers that enable the UN patients to be confidently discriminated from the HC children (averaged AUC = 0.91), namely @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Bacteroides vulgatus. In addition, metabolic comparison showed significantly decreased isobutyric acid (P = 0.005, FDR = 0.017) and increased isovaleric acid (P = 0.006, FDR = 0.017) in UN patients. We also identified notable correlations between microbial species and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and several nutritional indicators, including acetic acid and iron (r = 0.436, P = 0.029), @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$ and iron (r = 0.422, P = 0.036), @sm$ butyric acid @/sm$ and lymphocyte (r = -0.309, P = 0.011), and acetic acid and total protein (r = -0.303, P = 0.043).	1
We have developed bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC) as a method to generate rationally designed, functionally diverse @sm$ lipid A. @/sm$ BECC removes endogenous or introduces exogenous @sm$ lipid A @/sm$-modifying enzymes to bacteria, effectively reprogramming the @sm$ lipid A @/sm$ biosynthetic pathway. In this study, BECC is applied within an avirulent strain of @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ to develop structurally distinct LOS molecules that elicit differential Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Using reporter cell lines that measure NF-kappaB activation, BECC-derived molecules were screened for the ability to induce a lower proinflammatory response than Escherichia coli LOS. Their structures exhibit varied, dose-dependent, TLR4-driven NF-kappaB activation with both human and mouse TLR4 complexes. Additional cytokine secretion screening identified molecules that induce levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) comparable to the levels induced by phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (PHAD). The lead candidates demonstrated potent immunostimulation in mouse splenocytes, human primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). This newly described system allows directed programming of @sm$ lipid A @/sm$ synthesis and has the potential to generate a diverse array of TLR4 agonist candidates.IMPORTANCE There is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines against infectious diseases that continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.	1
We investigated the performance of a lab-scale moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) with respect to general bioconversion processes and biotransformation of two commonly used organophosphorus pesticides, @sm$ Chlorpyrifos @/sm$ (@sm$ CHL @/sm$) and Malathion (MAL). The reactor was operated for 300 days under different organic loads by changing hydraulic retention time (HRT). The decrease in organic load resulted in the formation of a thinner biofilm and the growth of more biomass in the bulk, which greatly shifted bioconversion processes. The low organic loading supported more nitrification in the reactor, but an opposite trend was observed for denitrification, which was enhanced at higher organic loading where the formation of anoxic zones in the thick biofilm was favored. 70% and 55% removal corresponding to 210 and 165 microg/m2/d occurred for MAL and @sm$ CHL @/sm$, respectively, at an HRT of 3 h and progressively increased with higher HRTs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a shift in composition and abundance of taxa throughout the reactor operation where lower loading rate supported the growth of a more diverse and evenly distributed community. The analysis also highlighted the dominance of heterotrophic communities such as Flavobacterium and @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$, which could be involved in the biotransformation of @sm$ CHL @/sm$ and MAL through co-metabolism.	2
We next examined the alteration of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation in @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$-infected non-CCSCs. Before infection, we removed preexisting CCSCs by FACs (Figure S1E, Supporting Information). We observed that non-CCSC lines, such as HCT116 and HT29, contain low levels of @sm$ lipid @/sm$ droplets compared to those in CCSCs. Contrary to the observation in CCSCs, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ infection significantly elevated @sm$ lipid @/sm$ droplets in these cells (Figure  3A-D). Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of lipogenesis-related genes was also elevated in @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$-infected CRC cells (Figure 3E), among them, FASN was significantly upregulated (Figure 3F-I). FASN is a central enzyme involved in de novo lipogenesis, directly corresponding to triacylglycerol accumulation in @sm$ lipid @/sm$ droplets. Functional investigation showed that FASN knockdown suppressed neutral lipid accumulation in @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$-infected HTC116 and HT29 cells (Figure 3J-L). Consistently, FASN inhibitor, cerulenin, suppressed @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ infection-elevated neutral lipid accumulation (Figure 3M,N). Together, the data show that @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ enhances @sm$ lipid @/sm$ accumulation in non-CCSCs by upregulating FASN expression.	1
We observed that at higher @sm$ CO @/sm$ partial pressures, relative abundances of Clostridium sensu stricto 12 increased, whereas Eubacterium, @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, and Colidextribacter were more abundant during lower @sm$ CO @/sm$ partial pressures (Figure 3). Moreover, n-caproate and i-butyrate concentrations varied similarly, but n-butyrate concentration varied in the opposite direction. Peaks of n-caproate did not always coincide with lower or higher partial pressures of @sm$ CO @/sm$, hence potential @sm$ CO @/sm$ inhibition on chain elongation did not seem to be a major concern.	3
We observed that the four organisms may contribute for the production of extracellular acetate, whereas all but @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ produced propionate. Predictions have shown butyrate production by @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$. In turn, I. bartlettii produced isobutyrate (Figure 5A and Supplementary Table S8), while both Escherichia sp. and I. bartlettii revealed to compete for ribose, @sm$ deoxyribose @/sm$ and cysteinylglycine, as well as for aspartate and phosphate, which were both products of @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ (Figure 5B).	1
We then focused on subsets of KO genes that corresponded to @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ biosynthesis and metabolism (Fig. S4B), which were supported by pyruvate kinase (pyk; K00873) and pyruvate-ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase (por; K03737), the two key enzymes of VFAs produced from @sm$ pyruvate @/sm$ conversion to acetyl-CoA. They were significantly up- and downregulated in the HG groups compared with the CON group, respectively. By identifying the taxonomic distribution of the two KOs based on the abundance of microbial genes, we found that @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ was dominant on day 7 of the diet shift, while members of Firmicutes bacterium CAG:110 and Prevotella ruminicola were both dominant on day 14, and Akkermansia muciniphila was dominant on day 28 (Fig.	1
We then focused on the @sm$ fatty-acid @/sm$-related pathways and found that the superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis initiation (P = 8.34e-8), @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ elongation (P = 0.037), type II fatty acid synthase (P = 0.027), superpathway of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis (P = 0.027), and superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis (P = 0.030) were all highly enriched in the Angus cattle (Figure 2B). These results were consistent with the muscular phenotypes, indicating that the Angus cattle hold more types of @sm$ fatty acids @/sm$ than the Simmental cattle (Supplementary Table 1). We further studied the association between the gut microbiota and the superpathway of @sm$ fatty acid @/sm$ biosynthesis initiation (Supplementary Figure 3). In total, 13 significantly related species including B. uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus), Blautia obeum (B. obeum), Ruminococcus torques, Clostridium bornimense, Coprococcus catus (C. catus), Coprococcus comes, Dorea formicigenerans, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum, Sphingomonas sp.	1
We therefore tested a full-length TIR-STING fusion from @gm$ Sphingobacterium faecium @/gm$ (SfSTING; IMG Gene ID 2735805876) for catalytic function and observed rapid hydrolysis of @sm$ NAD+ @/sm$ to nicotinamide and adenine diphosphate-ribose (Figure 3a,b; Extended Data Figure 5a-d). SfSTING potently responds to c-di-GMP and weakly to 3',3'-cGAMP, and catalysis is abolished by mutating a conserved TIR active-site glutamic acid (Figure 3b; Extended Data Figure 6f,g). Bacterial TIR-STING activation requires <100 nM c-di-GMP and results in cleavage of @sm$ NAD+ @/sm$ at 10x the rate observed for plant and animal TIR proteins involved in immune defense (Figure 3c; Extended Data Figure 5h,i).	2
When the targets of this study were compared between the two subpopulations of fibroblasts, IL-6 secretion was statistically significant after 24 and 48 h of @gm$ Pg @/gm$ @sm$ LPS @/sm$ stimulation (Figure 3A and B) by both subtypes of fibroblasts (from the palatal mucosa and gingival graft in marginal area), and the difference was greater with 48 h (Figure 3B). On the other hand, the secretion after Ec @sm$ LPS @/sm$ stimulation was only statistically significant after 48 h, by both subtypes of fibroblasts (Figure 3D).	1
While the full function of yxdL remains unknown, evidence suggesting that it functions as an antibiotic efflux pump is supported by homology to salX, which confers salivaricin resistance in @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$. Another gene cluster implicated within PGT8 is annotated as bceB, a bacitracin export permease protein. Furthermore, the bce system is paralogous to the yxd system and a component of @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$ resistance. We tested the resistance capabilities of PGT8 strains by culturing in media containing 256 microg/mL @sm$ bacitracin @/sm$ (Methods), and PGT8 stains grew in these conditions, while PGT1 strains did not (Fig.	4
Wickerhamomyces can promote the Strecker degradation pathway, thereby producing aldehydes that increase the flavor of SZR, which is supported by the findings in this study that Wickerhamomyces was positively correlated with hexanal and @sm$ acetaldehyde @/sm$. Overall, Weissella, @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus bacteria, and Kazachstania, Debaryomyces, Wickerhamomyces, Pichia, and Candida fungi were the main sources of VFCs.	1
With acetate at high levels shown in exclusively breast-fed babies (11:1 acetate:@sm$ lactate @/sm$) the excretion of acetate against its steep gradient becomes inefficient, impeding the carbon flux through the bifid shunt and ATP generation. The tolerance of bifidobacteria towards the end products (@sm$ lactate @/sm$ and acetate) is known to be low, as compared to lactococci or lactobacilli, for example. Cessation of growth for @gm$ B. breve @/gm$, B. longum, and B. infantis was reported to occur in the medium containing 12-18 g/L of both @sm$ lactate @/sm$ and acetate under pH-controlled conditions, while growth rate decline was observed at even lower concentrations of these end products, at 10 g/L. For comparison, for Lactobacillus sp. critical @sm$ lactate @/sm$ concentrations lie in the range of 60 to 90 g/L.	3
With respect to the absence of LT4 treatment, twelve kinds of bacteria (class Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacterales, and family Enterobacteriaceae in T2, phylum Actinobacteriota, classes Coriobacteriia and Actinobacteria, orders Coriobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales, family Bifidobacteriaceae, genus Bifidobacterium, and species @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium longum in T3) were considered as special bacteria for TPOAb- women with SCH, and these were found to be involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism (galactose metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$_biosynthesis). In the presence of LT4 treatment, five kinds of special bacteria were identified for TPOAb- women with SCH (phylum Bacteroidota, class Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, and genus Prevotella in T2 and genus Agathobacter in T3), and these were found to be involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism (pentose and glucuronate interconversions; @sm$ tryptophan @/sm$ metabolism). Earlier studies showed that subjects with GDM were characterized by a decrease in the abundance of members of family Enterobacteriaceae . SCFAs, which are produced by species @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, may suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines.	1
Within eBG6, two related STs are largely composed of Choleraesuis sensu stricto isolates, which do not produce @sm$ H2S @/sm$, whereas the other eight STs are largely composed of Choleraesuis var Kunzendorf, which do produce H2@gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ isolates also produce @sm$ H2S @/sm$, suggesting that var Kunzendorf might have been ancestral and sensu stricto (STs 68 and 139) corresponds to a lineage that has lost the ability to form @sm$ H2S. @/sm$ The association between @sm$ H2S @/sm$ production and ST is not absolute because one exceptional var Kunzendorf isolate was found in a sensu stricto ST and one sensu stricto isolate in a Kunzendorf ST.	1
abortus infection, inhibition experiments were performed with the specific inhibitors SB203580, SP600125, @sm$ PD98059 @/sm$ and BAY 11-7082, respectively. The production of CCL20 was strongly reduced (P < 0.001 as compared to untreated infected cells) by the JNK1/2 inhibitor and the NF-kappaB inhibitor in both Calu-6 and THP-1 cells, so that CCL20 levels produced by infected cells pretreated with these inhibitors did not differ significantly from those produced by uninfected controls (Fig 4). Conversely, inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 had no effect on CCL20 secretion by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ infected-THP-1 monocytes but produced a partial inhibition in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-infected Calu-6 cells.	3
abortus were cultivated in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ broth and incubated at 37 C at least two days before use. Raw 264.7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 4 x 104 cells per well and incubated at 37 C overnight. For this assay, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of SP (1, 2.5 and 5 mM) for 4 h before infection. After removing the old medium and washing with @sm$ PBS @/sm$ once, cells were infected with B. abortus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 in RPMI medium containing 10% HI-FBS, centrifuged at 200 xg for 5 min and incubated at indicated time points. At each time point, cells were washed with @sm$ PBS @/sm$, added 100 mug/ml gentamicin in RPMI, and incubated for 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria. After that, cells were washed with @sm$ PBS @/sm$ again, and 100 mul of distilled water (DW) was added to lyse the cells. Cells were diluted with @sm$ PBS @/sm$, plated in a @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ agar plate, and incubated for two days to determine CFUs.	0
abscessus, @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ and M. smegmatis. The complexes of benzohydroxamate associated with transition metallic ions (Cu2+ and Co2+) could inhibit M. tuberculosis growth by interacting with urease in the @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ metabolism.	2
abscessus, and @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ were monitored in SPR binding buffer (PBS-P, 0.5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride [TCEP], 2% @sm$ DMSO @/sm$) at 25 C and a flow rate of 30 mul/min.	0
accompanied by an elevated proportion of Dorea, Blautia, @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$, and Ruminococcus spp. Gut microbiota composition may vary between population groups and different stages of NAFLD, making any conclusive or causative claims about gut microbiota profiles in NAFLD patients challenging. Moreover, various metabolites may be involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, such as short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharide, bile acids, @sm$ choline @/sm$ and trimethylamine-N-oxide, and ammonia.	0
acetigenes, producing @sm$ acetate @/sm$). The species was identified as a member of the genus, Faecalicatena. The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences identified matches to members of three genera: Mediterraneibacter (Mediterraneibacter glycyrrhizinilyticus, 95.3%), @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ (Ruminococcus torques, 95.3%) and Faecalicatena (F. orotica, 94.9%, F. contortaT, 94.9%, Faecalicatena fissicatena, 94.8%). The similarity to these three genera was supported by POCP values above 50% to members of each genus, including; Mediterraneibacter (M. glycyrrhizinilyticus, 55.8%), @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ (R. torques, 57%) and Faecalicatena (F. fissicatena, 52.2%). GTDB-Tk assigned the isolate to 'Faecalicatena sp001487105', an as-yet-uncultured member of this genus. Due to the lack of sequence similarity, either at the 16S rRNA gene sequence or genome level, to the type species of either @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ or Mediterraneibacter, the isolate was placed within the Faecalicatena. Within the genome, 140 CAZymes were identified along with the utilisation of starch and glucose. KEGG-based analysis identified the presence of the following pathways: @sm$ acetate @/sm$ production identified from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1), propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1), sulfide and l-serine utilised to produce l-cysteine and @sm$ acetate @/sm$ (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47), l-glutamate production from ammonia via l-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-), folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).	1
acidilactici or @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ . The acid dissociation constant (pKa) may be implicated because at low pH, organic acids are mostly in protonated states, and the protons can diffuse into bacterial cells and cause cell death. The pKa of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ and acetic acid are 3.86 and 4.77, respectively. Thus the conversion of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ to acetic acid may reduce the antibacterial activity. In consideration of @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, but not acetic acid, played the major role in the growth inhibition of enterobacteria, the homofermentative LAB was also necessary for silages. Therefore, for development of functional bacterial inoculants, both of selected homofermentative and heterofermentative LAB should be involved, and the rate of them should be regulated based on the @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ and acetic acid production, so as to inhibition the growth of undesirable bacteria, as well as yeasts and fungi.	3
acidophilus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ in pregnant women for nine weeks led to a reduction in serum high sensitivity (hs)-CRP as the same probiotic supplementation in colorectal cancer, autoimmune, and chronic kidney disease. The decreased inflammation and oxidative stress due to probiotics might be due to their effects on increasing @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ (@sm$ GSH @/sm$) levels and scavenging superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, decreasing the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in adipocytes, and decreasing adiposity.	1
actinomycetemcomitans and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$. The coadhesion between F. nucleatum and these late colonizing Gram-negative species are usually mediated by lectin-@sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ interactions. For instance, the recognition between a galactose-specific lectin-like adhesin expressed by F. nucleatum and the sugar moiety present in the capsule and lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis contributes to coadhesion between the two species. Similar galactose-containing receptors are also found on cell surface of A. actinomycetemcomitans and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$. As for Tannerella forsythia which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis, its cell surface glycoproteins in S-layer act as adhesins in coadhesion with F. nucleatum. Apart from protein-@sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ interactions, some researchers have reported that leucine-rich repeat in proteins from @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ and T.	2
aeruginosa and @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ were the main resistant species (Table 3). The tested organisms could be ordered according to their sensitivity as follows: S. Typhimurium < B. cereus < E. coli < S. aureus < K. pneumoniae < S. haemolyticus < @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ < P. aeruginosa. The standard antibiotics, ampicillin, azithromycin, @sm$ cephradin @/sm$, and tetracycline, showed variable activities. P. aeruginosa was entirely resistant to ampicillin, @sm$ cephradin @/sm$, and tetracycline, while S. Typhimurium was resistant to ampicillin, azithromycin, @sm$ cephradin @/sm$, and penicillin (Table 3). Moreover, the plant extract revealed potent antibacterial activity toward Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Bacillus cereus species (21 +- 0.80, 23.46 +- 1.69, and 22.91 +- 0.96 mm), but had less potency toward P. aeruginosa and @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ compared to the antibiotics.	4
aeruginosa, ShuT from @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$, IsdE from S. aureus and YpHmuT indicated that it was probable that CdHmuT would have a @sm$ Tyr @/sm$ as one axial ligand, and a Met or His as the second (Figure S2). However, CdHmuT was predicted to be unique in that the axial ligands would be reversed (N-terminal His and C-terminal Met or @sm$ Tyr @/sm$) with respect to structurally characterized homologous hexacoordinate heme proteins (N-terminal @sm$ Tyr @/sm$ and C-terminal His for YpHmuT and N-terminal Met and C-terminal His for IsdE).	0
agalactiae were 0.05-0.11 muM, which were better than those of @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ (0.67 muM). CHAPk also had the potent antimicrobial activity against other @gm$ streptococcus @/gm$, with MICs of 0.03-0.11 muM against S. uberis, 0.11-0.22 muM against S. dysgalactiae, 0.05-0.86 muM against S. epidermidis, 0.11 muM against S. suis, which were superior to those of @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ (@gm$ streptococcus @/gm$: 0.34-2.69 muM). For the S. aureus strains, the MIC values of CHAPk were 0.43-3.44 muM, that of S. hyicus were 1.72 muM, those of S. epidermidis were 0.86-1.72 muM. There was almost no antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and C. albicans (>6.88 muM). These results suggested that CHAPk displays potent antimicrobial activity for staphylococcus and @gm$ streptococcus @/gm$, especially for @gm$ streptococcus @/gm$.	3
albicans, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$, S. mutans and S. oralis was used. Biofilms were grown anaerobically on hydroxyapatite discs and treated with natural mouthrinses Ratanhia, Trybol and Tebodont. 0.9% NaCl and 10% @sm$ ethanol @/sm$ served as negative controls, while 0.2% CHX served as positive control.	3
albicans, are known to form thick tenacious biofilms that dramatically increase tolerance to antifungal drugs commonly used in the treatment of VVC, such as fluconazole, miconazole, and @sm$ flucytosine @/sm$. Indeed, sessile cells have been shown to tolerate antifungal concentrations 1,000-fold greater than their planktonic counterparts. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy for RVVC may be through microbiome replacement therapy in the form of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ probiotics. Probiotic therapy involves the administration of live microorganisms, which directly results in a health benefit for the patient. Due to the diversity of lactobacilli within the vaginal microbiome, it is difficult to estimate which species would be most important to replace with probiotic therapy. One study evaluated Lactobacillus plantarum P17630 combined with the standard treatment of clotrimazole for 3 days and concluded a potential resolution of vaginal discomfort. The probiotic potential of secreted metabolites of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ against C. albicans has been summarized, identifying gaps in our knowledge of fungal-@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ interactions that could lead to improved treatment options.	3
alginolyticus, and @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$, with an inhibition zone diameter of >9 mm (Fig. 1J). The antibiotic susceptibility results showed that C. butyricum G13 was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, amikacin, amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, @sm$ cephazolin @/sm$, gentamicin, midecamycin, polymyxin, and minocycline; it was intermediate to oxacillin, erythromycin, neomycin, and tetracycline and resistant to ceftazidime, vancomycin, and trimethoprim (Fig.	3
alpha-15), Agaricus bisporus, Flavobacterium saccharophilum, Cytophaga marinoflava, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and @gm$ Sphingobacterium faecium @/gm$. Studies conducted on Agrobacterium tumefaciens showed that the FAD-dependent glucoside-3-dehydrogenase, most likely present in the periplasmic space of the bacterium, converts disaccharides, such as sucrose to 3-keto-sucrose, which is then transported inside the cell. The cytoplasmic enzyme, 3-ketoglucosidase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3-keto sucrose to form @sm$ fructose @/sm$ and 3-keto-d-glucose (5), which in turn gets reduced to glucose by the NADPH-dependent 3-ketoglucose reductase.	2
"amnii, Dialister micraerophilus, Sneathia amnii [recently re-named Sneathia vaginalis], @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, and L. iners) were only present in specimens from men reporting penile-vaginal sex (both within the past 60 days and the past year). Sexual behavior was strongly associated with inter-specimen variance in urethral microbiome composition in this study. It is hypothesized that BVAB colonizes the mucin-rich penile urethra in men, while ""core bacteria"" colonize the urethral meatus (where @sm$ oxygen @/sm$ may be more readily available)."	2
and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ spp. The secondary outcome measures were related to @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$ analysis in plasma [total, LDL, HDL @sm$ cholesterol @/sm$, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A-I and B (APO A and APO B)] together with the analysis of the variation of polyphenols and their metabolites in plasma and urine.	0
and greater abundances of @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$, Alistipes putredinis, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, and Sutterella, among others. Differences in abundance were also found in pathways related to biofilm formation, quorum sensing, @sm$ glutamate @/sm$, and amino acid aromatic metabolism.	0
aureus, @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ and E. coli. The same molecule also exhibited moderate to maximum antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Mucor. Imidazole-based drugs have been approved for clinical use as anticancer drugs - indimitecan has been demonstrated to inhibit the topoisomerase-I enzyme by intercalating between DNA base pairs to stabilize a ternary complex. @sm$ Benzimidazole @/sm$ has several biological applications and can be viewed as an extended imidazole scaffold as well as an indole bioisostere. Beck describes how it can result in a different spectrum of anticancer activities due to the production of various DNA cleavage sites relative to camptothecins, and therefore targets genes differently. @sm$ Benzimidazole @/sm$ rings may be responsible for the purine analog activity of bendamustine, as described by Weide et.	3

bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ in vitro. The results indicated that the accumulation amount of Se by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus reached 12.05 +- 0.43 microg/mL and 11.56 +- 0.25 microg/mL, respectively, accompanied by the relative maximum living cells when @sm$ sodium selenite @/sm$ was 80 microg/mL.	3
caviae, @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$. All strains were sensitive to neomycin and nalidixic acid and with few exceptions of A. caviae strains to streptomycin, gentamicin, @sm$ doxycycline @/sm$ and chloramphenicol .	3
cells is higher under a @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$-limiting environment compared to nitrogen starvation. Lee et al. revealed that A. hydrophila accumulated a P(3HB) homopolymer grown on glucose or sodium gluconate only under @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ limitation. Furthermore, when fatty acids were used as carbon sources, the highest PHA content was determined under the @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$-limiting condition. The same observations were made by Chen et al., who described that PHA content in A. hydrophila 4AK4 cells cultured under @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ limitation was 2.3 times higher (51.5% of CDW) than that obtained under nitrogen limitation (22.0% of CDW). It was observed that nutrient limitation is more favorable for the synthesis of PHAs in the Aeromonas sp. AC_01, AC_02, and AC_03 strains grown on pure and crude glycerol. The data indicate that biopolymer concentration was higher under @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ starvation, except for the AC_03 strain grown on crude glycerol during one-stage cultivation, when three times more biopolymers were synthesized and accumulated under nitrogen-limiting conditions. However, the highest PHA concentration was extracted during the two-step bioprocess of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. AC_03, cultured on pure glycerol (42% of CDW) under @sm$ phosphorus @/sm$ limitation.	2

For instance, in 2011, real-time WGS clarified the cause of a very mysterious outbreak in a farm in Germany. The outbreak was caused by enteroaggregative @gm$ E.coli O104:H4 @/gm$ clone, epidemiologically linked to human cases and transmitted via contaminated seeds.	0

coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid with the gene of MGL from @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$ were grown and the enzyme was purified according to the protocol previously described. Protein concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm (epsilon0.1% at 280 nm = 0.8). Protein purity was above 90% as assessed by SDS-PAGE. MGL catalytic activity was determined using @sm$ L-methionine @/sm$ as a substrate and measuring the rate of alpha-ketobutyrate production in the coupled reaction with HO-HxoDH monitoring the decrease of NADH absorption at 340 nm (Deltaepsilon = 6220 M-1 cm-1) at 37 C.	1
coli O157:H7 > @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$> L. monocytogenes. Previously, @sm$ polyphosphate @/sm$ has been reported to show antimicrobial activities against various Gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial activities of @sm$ polyphosphate @/sm$ against various Gram-positive bacteria is related to its ability to chelate divalent cations, resulting in cell division inhibition and loss of cell wall integrity. However, relatively little attention has been paid toward the mechanistic effect of @sm$ polyphosphate @/sm$ on Gram-negative bacteria. Previously, Obritsch et al. have reported that generation time and lag phase of E. coli K-12, O157:H7, and S. entericaser.Typhimurium were increased while growths of B.subtilis, S. aureus, and L. plantarum were inhibited by the @sm$ polyphosphate @/sm$ treatment.	3
coli and @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ hom. The E. coli pathway for lysine utilization is of special interest because of its ties to the @sm$ GABA @/sm$ metabolism genes (Fig. 12). E. coli decarboxylates L-lysine to generate cadavarine by using two pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes: LdcC and CadA. The cadavarine is used to transaminate 2OG, forming glutamate and 5-aminopentanal, by the enzyme PatA, named for its analogous role in putrescine metabolism. Similarly, PatD uses NAD+ to oxidize 5-aminopentanal thus generating 5-aminovalerate in addition to its better known function of converting 4-aminobutyraldehyde to @sm$ GABA @/sm$. Purified GabT and GabD were shown capable of converting 5-aminovalerate to glutarate with efficiencies comparable to those for conversion of @sm$ GABA @/sm$ to succinate. In @gm$ P. putida @/gm$, glutarate also is derived from L-lysine via 5-aminovalerate, but in this case the pathway uses the davBA, davT, and davD gene products.	2
coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$, and Pichia pastoris has been considered as a more reliable and cost effective approach for industrial production process. Production of carotenoids mainly beta-carotene and torularhodin has been enhanced in Rhodotorula mucilaginosa KC8 by using metabolic engineering and a mutagenesis approach (Wang Q. et al.,). Further, novel betalain derivative production has been shown to be induced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a heterologous microbial host by using glucose as a substrate and by using different @sm$ amines @/sm$ in the culture (Grewal et al.,).	1
coli, Enterobacter cloacae, @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$, Pantoea agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, were isolated and identified from layers' swabs, diet, water, floor, feces, fans, and workers' gloves in a poultry house (unpublished data). Thus, a fogging, misting, or foaming system for disinfecting the environments including the floor, cages, belt, deep litter, etc., in poultry houses has been introduced and used as a measure to control infectious diseases. Ozone, @sm$ chlorine @/sm$, quaternary ammonium salt, and glutaraldehyde compounds are commonly used in poultry houses.	3
coli, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica, @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Streptomyces lividans, and Streptomyces griseus. The best-understood role for YfiQ is acetylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs); acetylation inactivates Acs, preventing @sm$ acetate @/sm$ consumption.	2
coli, and @sm$ HI @/sm$ for @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$) through the device to remove cells that were not adhered to the channel surface. While imaging, we flowed a 1 M NaCl solution through the channel and observed cell plasmolysis, immediately after which we flowed ddH2O through the channel and observed cells elongating. We collected images of hundreds of single cells after exposing them to three conditions: (i) isotonic culture (PLB, LB, @sm$ HI @/sm$); (ii) hypertonic shock (1 M NaCl); and (iii) hypotonic shock (ddH2O).	3
difficile   strains (12.1 %) carried various @sm$ aminoglycoside @/sm$-resistance determinants. The most common determinants were aac6-aph2 (666 strains, 6.5 %), aph-III (279 strains, 2.7 %) and sat4 (271 strains, 2.6 %) genes. Notably, 270 strains carried a locus containing aph-III and sat4 genes adjacent to one another, 68.2 % of which (184/270) belonged to clade C5 (183 ST 11 strains and one ST 163 strain). This locus had 99.91 % nucleic acid identity to a gene cluster found in   @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$  , as described in a previous study.	4
difficile and human gut species @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$, B. thetaiotaomicron, C. asparagiforme, C. hiranonis and B. longum were cultured at 37  C in YBHI medium in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory). YBHI medium is Brain-Heart Infusion Medium (Acumedia Lab) supplemented with 0.5% Bacto Yeast Extract (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mg/mL D-Cellobiose (MilliporeSigma), 1 mg/mL D-maltose (MilliporeSigma), and 0.5 mg/mL @sm$ L-cysteine @/sm$ (MilliporeSigma).	2
durans, @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$, and E. mundtii. In contrast to the E. coli isolates, the majority of the enterococcal isolates in the present study were found to be AMR and the single highest resistance was to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$. In surface water samples collected in an area with intensive poultry production, the highest level of resistance among 36 enterococcal isolates was to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ (88%), followed by tetracycline (24%). Although @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ is commonly used in poultry production, we have not previously detected @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ residues in the USR watershed, which is not surprising given that it is not approved for use in dairy cattle in the United States. showed that the most common AMR phenotype among enterococcal isolates from dairy cattle was to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ (587/636; 92%). In addition, they detected at least 10 enterococcal species and @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$-resistant isolates were abundant among each of the different species. Similarly, 10 different enterococcal species were detected in surface water samples from the Upper Oconee watershed and the majority (564/637; 89%) were resistant to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$. In the present study, seven out of eight enterococcal species (except E. malodoratus) were resistant to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ (range of 49-100% isolates per species). The high rate of @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ resistance among enterococci is likely not a result of exposure to the antimicrobial, but due to the fact that most enterococci, with the exception of E. durans, are intrinsically resistant to @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$.	4
faecalis R612Z1 and @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ R615Z1 was similar, and that the enzymes exhibited higher specificity for tyrosine than for phenylalanine. However, in our trials, different behaviors of tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine accumulation were observed in relation to the strain. In particular, strains belonging to the same species (E. faecalis or @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$) were characterized by different responses indicating that, if the presence of tyrDC is common among enterococci, the decarboxylating potential can be extremely variable. The transcriptional analyses of the gene tyrDC confirmed these observations. In recent years, a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the gene expression level of amino acid decarboxylases on the @sm$ BAs @/sm$ accumulation in different food and model systems. However, up to now no studies have compared the tyrDC transcript levels in enterococcal strains of the same species. In the present study a variability of the tyrDC gene expression in different strains of E. faecalis and @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ was evidenced for the first time. The two strains with the higher decarboxylating potential (E. faecalis EF 37 and @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ FC12) were characterized by a higher transcription of tyrDC after 2 h of incubation and the maintenance of a remarkably higher transcription level throughout all the incubation period considered here.	1

gingivalis and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$, in breast cancer patients. However, the study did not directly examine the microbiome in breast tumor. Therefore, the association between oral microbiota and breast cancer is somewhat unreliable. verified that @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ could spread through blood and colonize breast cancer sites in a FAP2-dependent manner, thereby impairing anti-tumor immunity and promoting the progression of breast cancer, while the corresponding @sm$ metronidazole @/sm$ antibacterial treatment could delay the progression of tumor. In addition, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ colonized in breast cancer can also activate NF-kappaB through TLR4/MyD88 pathway, creating an immunosuppressive TME by recruiting immunosuppressive cells, and promoting the immune escape of breast cancer cells by MYC-dependent up-regulation of PD-L1 and CD47 in breast cancer.	3

Phenol:@sm$ chloroform @/sm$ DNA extraction was performed on one half of each mouse heart for both polymicrobial-infected and sham-infected mice. PCR analysis revealed 1 out of 15 polymicrobial-infected mice were positive for the existence of P. gingivalis genomic DNA in the heart (Table 3). PCR analysis of thoracic and abdominal aortic samples revealed the presence of a polymicrobial infection for both areas of the aorta in several of the polymicrobial-infected mice. In the thoracic and abdominal aorta 9 out of 15 and 10 out of 15 mice were found to contain P. gingivalis genomic DNA, respectively. @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ genomic DNA was found in the thoracic aorta of 12 out of 15 polymicrobial-infected mice.	0

In this study, researchers concluded that B. obeum, R. intestinalis, E. hallii, and A. caccae shoud be preserved by cryopreservation in @sm$ glycerol @/sm$, sucrose, and inulin solution and only sucrose and inulin for B. thetaiotaomicron. In another study this same research group evaluated the impact of two cryoprotectives, @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ (15% v/v) and inulin (5% w/v) alone and in combination, in preserving SCFAs formation and recovery of major gut butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia spp., Eubacterium rectale, F. prausnitzii, and E. hallii) during cryopreservation for 3 months at -80 C. Results revealed that gut butyrate producers can be well-preserved with @sm$ glycerol @/sm$ and inulin during frozen storage (Bircher et al.,).	3
hydrophila, Ochrobacter antropia, nonfermantating gram (-) rods, Acinetobacter Iwofii and @gm$ A sobria @/gm$ were isolated. All of the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacine, cefotaxime, @sm$ ceftazidime @/sm$, gentamycine and trimetoprim-sulfamethoxasole.	3

isolates recovered from urban wastewater, only nine were identified as @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$. Six of those were recovered from media without erythromycin. Four of the six isolates exhibited resistance to tigecycline (4/6, 66.6%) followed by @sm$ nitrofurantoin @/sm$ (3/6, 50%), linezolid (3/7, 48.85%), fluoroquinolones (2/6, 33.3%), vancomycin (1/6, 16.6%), and ampicillin (1/7, 14.2%) (Supplementary Figure S1).	4
jejuni exclusively harbors genes required for the biosynthesis of the N-linked oligosaccharide, further examination of pgl loci from other @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species  revealed the presence of an open reading frame for a generic serine protease inhibitor, an ecotin homolog of E. coli. Interestingly this ecotin homolog was present in specific non-thermophilic Campylobacters primarily described to inhabit the oral cavity and associated with the onset of periodontitis, an inflammatory disease caused by a consortium of microbes and host defense mechanisms. Here, bacterial killing by neutrophils comes as a double-edged sword; @sm$ reactive oxygen species @/sm$ and bactericidal proteins such as elastase not only neutralize bacteria, but also damage host tissues and increase the severity and progression of periodontal diseases. C. rectus, in particular, is a pathogen detected at elevated levels in diseased human subgingival sites when compared to healthy non-diseased controls and is often associated with other oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species isolated from oral sites include Campylobacter showae, Campylobacter curvus, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter sputorum and @gm$ Campylobacter hominis @/gm$. In these @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species, the N-glycan is also believed to protect glycoproteins from proteolysis, however, ecotin might provide an additional survival advantage in the periodontal pockets that contain high levels of neutrophil serine proteases.	3

longum, and @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ exerted a marked effect on secondary bile acid synthesis leading to an increase in the plasma level of LCA accompanied by an increase in taxa with a potential for biosynthesis of LCA such as E. plexicaudatum harboring a 7alpha-dehydroxylation gene cluster. The combined results of the analyses of the liver transcriptome and the plasma metabolome indicated that activation of FXR mediated by the bacterial metabolite LCA reduced the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (such as Srebf1 and Fasn) and increased the expression of target genes involved in lipolysis (such as Pnpla2 and Lipe) suggesting an additional mechanism for lowering @sm$ lipids @/sm$. Interesting, the level of HMB was increasing greatly by administration of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ in which HMB is produced via degradation of BCAA.	1

mitis ATCC 6249, @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ ATCC 49133, and S. oralis ATCC 35037 in another chemically defined media, ZMB1, and examined growth after 20 hr of incubation at OD600nm (Figure 5A-H). We found that only 2 Streptococcus spp. grew with preterm human milk compared to media controls: S. sanguinis and S. parasanguinis (Figure 5B,C). Moreover, 2 strains were suppressed by preterm milk: S. salivarius and S. thermophilus (Figure 5A,D). Also, 3 Streptococcus strains could use preterm and full-term formula with HMOs to support their growth. Of the Streptococci examined, we found that S. pyogenes, S. mitis, @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ and S. oralis did not respond in terms of growth to any dietary interventions. As members of the lactic acid bacteria group, Streptococci can also produce @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$ and lower the pH. When we assessed media pH (Figure 6A-H), we found that S. sanguinis and S. parasanguinis, which had improved growth with preterm milk, lowered the pH compared to media controls (Figure 6B,C). We also found that 3 Streptococcus spp. reduced the pH in the presence of preterm formula and 2 strains reduced the pH in presence of full-term formula with HMOs. No changes in pH were observed in S. thermophilus, S. mitis, @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ or S.	1

prepared stable @sm$ curcumin @/sm$-loaded SLNs by the HPH method with mannitol as cryoprotectant. The size of the particle was 112 nm and the loading efficiency was 70.4 +- 1.2%. The @sm$ curcumin @/sm$ particles showed increased antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus compared to free @sm$ curcumin @/sm$ at the same concentration. More than 85% and 92% of the @sm$ curcumin @/sm$ was released after 36 and 48 h. They demonstrated that 5% mannitol was the preferred cryoprotectant compared to 15% mannitol due to their particle size being 163 nm and 306 nm. To improve the loaded capacity and stability, He et al. used propylene glycol monoesters (PGMEs) instead of glyceryl tripalmitate to fabricate carvacrol-loaded SLNs (Car-SLNs) against S. aureus and @gm$ E. coli O157: H7 @/gm$.	3
produced 0.26 g/L of acetoin from methanol by integrating acetoin synthesis genes into @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$. The titer of acetoin was enhanced to 0.42 g/L by enhancing the flux towards pyruvate with the overexpression of malic enzyme and isocitrate lyase with a yield of 0.07 g acetoin/g methanol. To demonstrate the feasibility of M. extorquens AM1 for the production of @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$-derived products, the malonyl-CoA reductase gene was integrated into M. extorquens AM1 to produce 3-hydroxypropionic acid. However, because of the conversion of 3-HP to propionyl-CoA (an important metabolite of the EMC pathway), only 69.8 mg/L of 3-HP was produced by the recombinant strain of M. extorquens AM1. Zhu et al. introduced the mevalonate synthesis pathway, wherein optimized expression of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (phaA) produced 215 mg/L and 2.22 g/L of mevalonate in shake flasks and fed-batch fermenters, respectively, from M. extorquens AM1. In another study, genes encoding trans-enoyl-CoA reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase were heterologously expressed along with EMC crotonase to produce 15.1 mg/L of 1-butanol using ethylamine as a substrate. However, the low amount of @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ is a bottleneck in the production of @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$-derived products. The @sm$ acetyl-CoA @/sm$ amount was enhanced by 7% with the help of a transcriptional regulator, which led to the production of 2.67 g/L mevalonate from M.	1

Culture tubes were incubated at 37  C until mid-log-phase growth was achieved, at which time pairs of cultures were exposed to either 50 muL of the respective @sm$ lignan @/sm$ (50 mM in methanol) or 50 muL of vehicle (methanol). Then, 1.5-2 hours following @sm$ lignan @/sm$ (n=3) or vehicle (n=3) exposure, cultures were removed from the anaerobic chamber and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4  C.	3

reported that @sm$ biotin @/sm$ biosynthesis genes (8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase: K00652; adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase: K00833; dethiobiotin synthetase: K01935) contributed to the clustering of enterotype 1, which is enriched in the Bacteroides genus. Our metatranscriptome analysis also revealed a higher expression of genes related to @sm$ biotin @/sm$ biosynthesis for @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ in the BB536-HGM group compared to the HGM group. In addition, in vitro bioassays indicated that @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ metabolized pimelate into @sm$ biotin @/sm$. Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in @sm$ biotin @/sm$ concentrations in the gut lumen of these HGM mice was induced by the co-existence of B. longum BB536 and @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$.	1

Respiratory @sm$ quinones @/sm$ were not detected.	0
smithii plays an important role in the efficient digestion of polysaccharides with complex chemical structures (highly enriched in the buttered milk tea due to the addition of roasted barley), by both optimizing @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ levels for bacterial polysaccharide digestion and consuming the end products of bacterial fermentation. Interestingly, upon bacteria-archaea correlation analysis, a number of SCFAs-producing bacteria (including @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$, C. aerofaciens, and P. copri) which carry out anti-inflammatory functions were found to have positive associations with M. smithii, hinting at mutualistic/syntrophic versus antagonistic relationships between gut bacteria and archaea. A prominent example of bacterial-archaeal syntrophism was previously established for Ruminococcus and methanogens, where the methanogens consume @sm$ H2 @/sm$, allowing Ruminococcus to produce twice as many ATP molecules from the same amount of substrate. From our data, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Collinsella, and Methanobrevibacter may form a syntrophic guild specified for the degradation of starches and complex polysaccharides contained in rural and ethnic diets, as well as for SCFA generation and depletion of gut @sm$ H2 @/sm$. This is also reflected in our observation that rural residents had an increased abundance of SCFA (pyruvate) fermentation module in the gut archaeome, compared to urban residents. Prevotella assists in breaking down carbohydrate/fiber-rich foods into simpler sugars (poly- and monosaccharides) and other products (such as succinate) to be fermented by bacteria such as Ruminococcus and Collinsella. Fermentation byproducts (including @sm$ H2 @/sm$ and acetate-/H+) produced would then be consumed by Methanobrevibacter with the subsequent production of CO2 and/or CH4.	2

Moreover, HBPA showed to be able to foster beneficial SCFAs-producer F. prausnitzii and fiber-degrading B. caccae. In comparison to HB, the better performance obtained by HBPA are due the action of alcalase that gives a product with a higher rate proteins/@sm$ peptides @/sm$ with MW around or lower than 15 kDa, and an increased percentage of soluble proteins (10%). It is reported, for example that Lactobacillaceae likes @sm$ peptides @/sm$ more than proteins, and prefers to ferment low molecular weight @sm$ peptides @/sm$ than proteins.	2

used OG in conjunction with photodynamic inactivation (PDI) by blue light (BL) to eradicate bacteria and eliminate biofilms of @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$. In this study, PDI operated through the interaction of applied BL, the exogenous photosensitizer OG, and oxygen to produce @sm$ ROS @/sm$ within the cell, which destroy intracellular lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and kill the bacterium. OG and BL administered individually exhibited some bactericidal effect, but BL irradiation with 0.4 mM of OG killed a significant amount of @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ cells in suspension, and S. aureus showed even higher susceptibility. BL also boosted the uptake of OG into cells, and BL + OG seriously damaged cell walls and caused cells to disgorge cytoplasm and collapse. Production of  OH resulted in lethal oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. BL also enhanced the inhibition of biofilm formation by OG, and the combination was able to efficiently eradicate established biofilms. In a further experiment, the authors tested the efficacy of electrospun poly(lactic-acid) nanofiber-based packaging material in combination with OG and irradiated with BL for reducing the microbial contamination of giant salamander meat (a culinary delicacy and medicinal in traditional Chinese medicine) by @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$; 30 min of treatment reduced the bacteria count by approximately 99%, indicating that active OG/PLA nanofibers can be used to prolong the shelf life of perishable foods.	3
vulgare SPU B805, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222, Bacillus licheniformis and @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ due to their good qualities and immense importance in metabolic engineering. K. vulgare SPU B805, another 2-KGA-producing strain, can convert L-sorbose to 2-KGA with high efficiency when co-cultured with companion strain. P. putida KT2440 is a good chassis for the production of various industrial products such as n-butanol, @sm$ vanillin @/sm$, and ethanol because of its versatile metabolism and low nutritional requirements. P. denitrificans PD1222, a soil-denitrifying bacterium, is considered as one of the best sources for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production because the strain can accumulate high yield in the cells, and can use a wide variety of industrial wastes as carbon sources to produce target products. B. licheniformis, as a generally regarded as a safe (GRAS) strain with the qualified characteristics of fast growth rate and strong sugar consumption, is usually used to produce 2,3-butanediol (BDO), and is also a good chassis strain for the production of acetoin, a common additive in the food industry and a building block for chemical materials. @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ can be used to produce 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), an important renewable biotechnological building block. Moreover, @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ has great biotechnology potential for its ability to produce biomolecules of industrial significance, such as 2,3-butanediol (2,3 BD), pullulanase and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).	1
