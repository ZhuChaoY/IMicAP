@gm$ Legionella @/gm$ are poorly staining Gram-negative bacilli that require @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ and other specific nutrients when grown on artificial laboratory media. At least 40 species of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ have been shown to cause disease, but the most prominent pathogenic species is @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$, which first received extensive attention after an outbreak in 1976 in Philadelphia. The disease is found worldwide, with most sporadic cases occurring during the summer and fall months. The reservoir is primarily aquatic. Hot water systems, air-conditioning cooling towers and evaporative condensers have all been implicated in outbreaks, as have decorative fountain and retail store misters (Figure 22.5 ). The organism has also been found in creeks and ponds, and the soil from their banks. The bacterium survives for months in tap and distilled water. The primary route of transmission is thought to be through the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure is not uncommon, as reflected in serologic assays that show that 1-20% of the general population have antibodies to @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$.	2
@gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ abundance was also selectively increased in pigs fed six servings of mushrooms. In humans, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ degrades plant fibers and produces @sm$ acetate @/sm$ and succinate as major end products.	1
@sm$ Indole @/sm$-producing bacterial species @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Peptoniphilus harei, and Escherichia coli, were found in 94% of the samples analyzed, with maximum relative abundance among individuals being 2.4% of reads. Higher relative abundance of @sm$ indole @/sm$-producing bacteria were found among women with CST IV (Figure 6A), and in women PAT (although not statistically significant) (Figure 6B). These results verify that @sm$ indole @/sm$-producing bacteria are commonly occurring within the female vaginal microbiota, and that microbiota dysbiosis and azithromycin treatment may be relevant to higher abundance of these bacterial species.	1
A 23 year old male patient with a history of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis managed with Adalimumab and @sm$ Mesalazine @/sm$ presented with a six week history of weight loss, lethargy and fever in October 2020. He also had a history of recurrent @gm$ Clostridioides difficile @/gm$.	0
A 29.5-kb plasmid, pSX267, from @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ DSM 20267 was found to code for arsenate, @sm$ arsenite @/sm$, and antimony (III) resistance. The isolated plasmid was transformed into S. aureus, where the same resistances were expressed. It was of special interest to see whether pSX267 showed any DNA sequence homology with the well-studied penicillinase plasmid from S. aureus pI258, also conferring arsenate, @sm$ arsenite @/sm$, and antimony III resistance. By the use of the Southern blotting technique, it was found that DNA sequence homology exists in the region of arsenate, @sm$ arsenite @/sm$, and antimony resistance, in addition to the region where the origin of replication, the incompatibility, and the replication A function were mapped on pI258. This finding was confirmed by electron microscope heteroduplex analysis, which allowed a correlation between the genetic and physical maps of pI258 and pSX267. Duplex DNA was formed at the arsenate operon of pI258, with a length of 2.6 kb, and at the incompatibility and replication A region, comprising a length of 2.5 kb. Adjacent to this latter region, two small regions of DNA homology were present, with lengths of 0.2 and 0.27 kb. Both plasmids share approximately 20% DNA sequence homology. The DNA homology of the arsenate, @sm$ arsenite @/sm$, and antimony III resistance coding regions between pI258 and pSX267 indicate that these plasmid-determined resistance markers are highly conserved and distributed among different staphylococcal species.	4
A case of pneumonia due to @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$--only the 20th culture-proven case reported so far--progressed with cavitation 9 days after the initiation of intravenous therapy with erythromycin. Review of all 20 reported cases revealed a similar propensity toward radiographic progression (25%) and cavitation (25%) during therapy. A slow response to long courses of erythromycin was the rule (35% of cases). In two instances, long courses of intravenous erythromycin failed and the patient died. Pleural effusion was reported in 60% of patients, including two with empyema. Overall mortality was high (40%). Although mortality was only 21% among patients who lived long enough to receive adequate courses of erythromycin, all three such patients who died had received erythromycin alone. Combination therapy with erythromycin and @sm$ rifampin @/sm$ proved more effective in terms of survival. Infections due to non-pneumophila @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ may be overlooked because of the organisms' special serological and culture requirements.	3
A comparison of the differences of delta13C values of palmitic acid (C16:0) with the delta13C values of the substrates revealed that the isotope ratio is independent of the growth stage and that most microorganisms showed enrichment of C16:0 with 13C when growing on @sm$ glycerol @/sm$. With the exception of @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$, all microorganism showed depletion of 13C in C16:0 while incorporating the carbons of glucose, and most of them were enriched with 13C from mannose, with the exception of Pseudomonas fluorescens and the Zygomycotina.	2
A heat map shows the top 50 bacterial genera that exhibited the most substantial abundance changes after exposure to @sm$ AST @/sm$ (Figure 7). Of the 50 genera, the abundance of 13 genera (Lachnospiraceae, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Desulfovibrio, Clostridia_UCG-014, Eubacterium, Negativibacillus, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Monoglobus, Gastranaerophilales, Acetatifactor, Butyricimonas, and Adlercreutzia) increased and the abundance of eight genera (Faecalibacterium, Prevotella. Lachnospira, Turicibacter, Bilophila, Escherichia-Shigella, Blautia, Muribaculum) decreased in HN model rats compared with their abundance in normal rats. Among these altered genera, many were related to urea metabolism. Eubacterium, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, and Clostridia have been reported to possess genes for urease production.	3
A multiresistant @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ strain spread during a six month period in a paediatric oncology ward amongst nine children, who had different tumors and malformations. Three children who had shared a room were especially affected. @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ was isolated 122 times from the children with tumors and five times from their environment. Specimens from which the bacteria were isolated, included blood cultures, catheter tips, wound swabs, drains, skin and mucous membranes from most parts of the body. The majority of the @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ strains were resistant to ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, azlocillin, doxycycline and cephalosporins of the second and third generation and sensitive to imipenem, aminoglycosides and @sm$ quinolones @/sm$. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of the @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ strains from the paediatric oncology ward were compared to those isolated from other wards in the hospital. @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ isolates from the intensive care unit had a reduced sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, whereas the isolates from the other wards were, with the exception of ampicillin, sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. The analysis of the @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ strains from the paediatric oncology ward revealed the same antimicrobial resistance pattern, bacteriocin type, RFLP-type and an identical enzyme and whole cell profile. Isolates from other wards showed considerably deviating patterns. The systematic registration and isolation of patients, colonized or infected with multiresistant @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ strains, together with infection control methods, lead to a significant reduction in infections.	3
A severe episode of Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis in a patient with HIV infection was treated with ciprofloxacin and, because of therapeutic failure, subsequently with @sm$ roxithromycin @/sm$. After treatment, @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ was again isolated from feces and shown to be resistant to both drugs. We present molecular evidence of the sequential development of both types of resistance in the patient isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first case with documented evidence showing sequential emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones and erythromycin in a strain of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ during treatment.	4
A transposon Tn917-induced mutant strain of @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ was isolated that required exogenous @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ for growth. The transposon was found to reside within a gene, designated cysE, encoding a protein of 216 amino acids with a high level of similarity to bacterial serine acetyltransferases. The cysE::Tn917 mutant completely lost serine acetyltransferase activity, which is easily detectable in the wild-type strain. In addition, the mutant strain could no longer grow in minimal medium without @sm$ cysteine @/sm$. Therefore, the cysE gene product is essential for the de novo synthesis of @sm$ cysteine @/sm$ via O-acetyl-L-serine in @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$. The cysE gene is surrounded by genes encoding glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (gltX) and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (cysS), as deduced from sequence comparisons. The genetic organisation in @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$, gltX-cysE-cysS, is identical to that found in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus.	2

"A unique genetic structure containing the aminoglycoside resistance gene cluster aadE-sat4-aphA-3 and aacA-aphD has been identified on the chromosome of @gm$ C. coli @/gm$. Recently, a high prevalence and predominance of the aph(2"")-If gene has been reported in Campylobacter. The aph(2"")-If shows resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, sisomicin, and @sm$ tobramycin @/sm$ (Toth er al., 2013). A novel streptomycin resistance gene has also been described, and its widespread presence among @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ may partly account for the streptomycin resistance."	4
All @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ derivatives were from 544 (@gm$ ATCC23448 @/gm$), smooth virulent @gm$ B. abortus biovar @/gm$ 1 strains. Ba598 (544 DeltavirB4), Ba600 (544 GFP+), and Ba604 (DeltavirB4 GFP+) have been described. @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ strains were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks and cultured on Brucella broth (Becton Dickinson) or Brucella broth containing 1.5% agar. @sm$ Kanamycin @/sm$ was used at 40 mug/ml.	3
All @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin (AC) and @sm$ amoxicillin with clavulanic acid @/sm$ (XL), with MIC values ranging from 0.016 to 0.125 mug/mL.	3
All the @sm$ oligonucleotides @/sm$ used were commercially synthesised (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). The laboratory culture collections in this study, @gm$ Salmonella enterica subsp. serovar Enteritidis @/gm$ (SE H16), Vibrio cholerae 86020, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus J 42 were used as the positive controls.	0
Alle @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$-Spezies besitzen eine chromosomal kodierte AmpC-ss-Laktamase, die induzierbar oder konstitutiv exprimiert werden kann. Stamme mit induzierbar exprimierter AmpC-ss-Lactamase erscheinen in der Testung gegen @sm$ Piperacillin @/sm$ und Drittgenerations-Cephalosporine sensibel, es werden unter Therapie mit diesen Substanzen aber Mutanten selektiert, die die ss-Laktamase induziert oder konstitutiv exprimieren; diese sind gegen alle ss-Laktame ausser Carbapeneme resistent.	3
Aloe-emodin, @sm$ rhein @/sm$ and emodin obtained from commercial rhubarb possess significant antibacterial activity against four strains of methicillin-resistant @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (MRSA) and also a strain of methicillin-sensitive @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (MSSA). Aloe-emodin possesses antibacterial effects on the strains of MRSA and MSSA, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/mL. @sm$ Rhein @/sm$ possess antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli K12 with an MIC value of 128 mug/mL. Chrysophanol, @sm$ rhein @/sm$, physcion and aloe-emodin exhibit antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC 25250 mug/ml) using ketoconazole as control. Revandchinone-1 and 3 have shown only moderate antibacterial activity. Revandchinone-4 has been found to possess good antibacterial properties against some Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sphaericus and @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$) using penicillin G as control, and Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella aerogenes, Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using streptomycin as control.	3
Although pulmonary symptoms accompany up to 16% of cases of infection with @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, pleural effusion has rarely been reported. A 12 year old girl had brucellosis with pulmonary disease and a pleural effusion. The pleural fluid was clear and straw coloured with 2700 leucocytes/mm3 (93% lymphocytes), a protein level of 48 g/1, and a @sm$ glucose @/sm$ concentration of 4.1 mmol/l. Culture of the pleural fluid grew @gm$ Br melitensis @/gm$.	1
Aminoglycoside-aminocyclitols including streptomycin, kanamycin, capreomycin and @sm$ amikacin @/sm$ showed considerable activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with MICs well below their Cmax and relatively low MBC/MIC ratios. Kanamycin, capreomycin and @sm$ amikacin @/sm$ remained highly active against 'resistant' and 'multidrug-resistant' M. tuberculosis isolates except for some 'multidrug-resistant' isolates which showed complete cross-resistance between streptomycin and the selected 2-deoxystreptamines. Gentamicin displayed anti-tuberculous activity but was bacteriostatic only. Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, in particular Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, were more resistant than M. tuberculosis. @sm$ Amikacin @/sm$ was inhibitory against Mycobacterium kanasii, @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$ and Mycobacterium fortuitum, but was bactericidal against @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ only. Kanamycin was also bactericidal against @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$. Growth of M. fortuitum was inhibited by @sm$ amikacin @/sm$ and neomycin which was also inhibitory against M. tuberculosis and @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$.	3
and non-pathogenic and pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica than in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis or @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$. This was largely due to differences in the activity of efflux systems, but also to differences in outer membrane permeability because uptake of the probe in KCN/@sm$ arsenate @/sm$-poisoned cells was slower in the former group than in Y. pseudotuberculosis and @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$. The probe accumulation rate was higher in Y. pseudotuberculosis and @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ grown at 37 degrees C than at 26 degrees C and was always highest in @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$. These yersiniae had LPSs with shorter polysaccharides than Y. enterocolitica, particularly when grown at 37 degrees C. Gel<-->liquid-crystalline phase transitions (Tc 28-31 degrees C) were observed in LPS aggregates of Y. enterocolitica grown at 26 and 37 degrees C, with no differences between non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains. Y. pseudotuberculosis and @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ LPSs showed no phase transitions and, although the fluidity of LPSs of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica grown at 26 degrees C were close below the Tc of the latter, they were always in a more fluid state than Y. enterocolitica LPS. Comparison with previous studies of Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis serotype minnesota rough LPS showed that the increased fluidity and absence of transition of Y. pseudotuberculosis and @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ LPSs cannot be explained by their shorter polysaccharides and suggested differences at the lipid A/core level.	0
Antibiotics are used to target anaerobic bacteria, especially @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$. A variety of antibiotics are employed, including metronidazole, amoxicillin, @sm$ amoxicillin/clavulanic acid @/sm$, clindamycin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones. However, @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ strains show resistance levels as high as 21.56% to metronidazole, 25.49% to amoxicillin, and 23.52% to clindamycin. Significant levels of resistance have also been recorded for penicillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, and tetracycline. While antibiotic resistance is rising, new antimicrobials are increasingly necessary, but in recent years there has in fact been a decrease in the discovery of new antibiotics. To counteract this lack of drug discovery, new treatments for @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ have been documented.	4
Antimicrobial resistance profiles, and genetic determinants regulating resistance mechanisms, have been studied in isolates of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ from pigs and, to a lesser extent, from human cases. Penicillin resistance in @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ was first reported in the UK from a serotype 2 isolate from a human in 1980 and has emerged in @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ isolates from pigs worldwide. More recently, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was reported in China and Europe. Extensive resistance has been reported against @sm$ aminoglycosides @/sm$, beta-lactams, trimethoprim and amphenicols.	4
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done on all @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotype 2 isolates using E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden), according to instruction of the manufacturer. The antimicrobials tested were penicillin, chloramphenicol, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Interpretative criteria were used according to CLSI guidelines for viridans group streptococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae strain ATCC 49619 was used for quality control purpose. @sm$ Erythromycin @/sm$ resistance phenotypes were identified using the triple disk diffusion test as described.	4
Arabinoxylan, a plant polysaccharide, stimulates the growth of beneficial bacteria known to produce butyrate, such as Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale and @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$. It has also been proposed that plant @sm$ polyphenols @/sm$ may also have prebiotic properties; these compounds are plentiful in fruits, nuts, seeds, and vegetables, as well as food products and beverages such as chocolate, coffee, red wine, and soymilk. @sm$ Polyphenols @/sm$ increase the counts of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and decrease those of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus.	2
As expected, enzymatic activity of beta-glucosidase was observed in both @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ wild type and @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH (Figure 3B and Table 1) with various concentrations of pNPG (400, 800, and 1600 mg/L). As shown in Figure 3B, we found that @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ wild type also showed enzymatic activity for beta-glucosidase, and it was assumed that the intrinsic beta-glucosidases, due to their requirement in the metabolism of diverse @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources such as cellulose and lactose in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$, showed hydrolytic activity for pNPG regardless of their substrate specificity for isoflavone glycoside forms. Meanwhile, taking into consideration normalized specific activity of beta-glucosidase, @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH showed approximately two-fold higher activity than @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ wild type (Figure 3B and Table 1). This result indicated that the expressed IH in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ harboring pCB4270V4-IH was biologically active in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$.	1
As the dominant bacteria in ethanol fermentation, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ showed strong acid resistance in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors for @sm$ H2 @/sm$ production at pH values less than 4.0; however, it is difficult for @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ to live in isolation and produce @sm$ hydrogen @/sm$ in an overly acidic/alkaline environment in a pure culture system. @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ tends to operate better as the dominant species in a microbial community compared with a pure culture, especially in extreme pH conditions, possibly due to syntrophic mechanisms with other bacteria. Further studies could focus on co-culture of @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ with other microorganisms and explore possible synergistic interaction mechanisms.	1
Based on the inhibition zone obtained, it was observed that the synthesized AgNPs expressed antibacterial activity in the range of 9-14 mm against @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ and Staphylococcus epidermidis respectively. Highest antibacterial activity was seen against Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was the most sensitive to the AgNPs with a DIZ value of 14.33 +- 0.57 mm, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis with DIZ value of 11.16 +- 0.28 mm and 11.33 +- 0.57 mm respectively. With respect to Gram negative bacteria, highest antibacterial activity was expressed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.0 +- 0.20 mm), followed by Escherichia coli (10.0 +- 1.0 mm), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.0 +- 0.50 mm) and @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (9.43 +- 0.40 mm). The observed antibacterial activity of synthesized BO-AgNPs in the current study is in accordance with previous studies. Anandalakshmi et al. (2016) observed @sm$ silver nanoparticles @/sm$ mediating similar bactericidal action using Pedalium murex leaf extract.	3
Batch culture production of CT-like toxin and CT by isolates of @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ and different biotypes of V. cholerae was found to be highest in shake flask cultures of Casamino Acids-yeast extract broth grown at 27 degrees C with vigorous aeration. Incorporation of @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ into the growth medium at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml increased yields from wild-type strains. Dramatically higher yields were obtained when a spontaneous resistance mutant of strain 61892 was grown in the presence of 200 to 300 micrograms of @sm$ lincomycin @/sm$ per ml.	4
Characterization of 865 isolates, all strict anaerobes and @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ fermenters, showed 12 to 39 distinguishable strains from each host and indicated that some strains were present the full period of about 18 months. Sixty percent of the isolates belonged to one of five types, tentatively identified with five species-Bifidobacterium adolescentis, @gm$ Eubacterium aerofaciens @/gm$, E. rectale, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Ruminococcus bromii. There was distinct host idiosyncrasy in the pattern of estimated counts of these five types. Certain strains resembling B. adolescentis, @gm$ E. aerofaciens @/gm$, and P.	2
Consequently, we investigated whether HSGN-218 has a deleterious effect on important representative members of the normal gut microbiota such as @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp and Bacteroides spp. Bacteroides spp comprise a large proportion of the intestinal microbiota, which were reported to contribute to bile acid-mediated inhibition of C. difficile and prevent CDI in mouse model. Additionally, lactobacilli were reported to interfere with C. difficile both in vitro and in vivo. As depicted in Table 5, HSGN-218 exhibited weak antibacterial activity against @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ strains (MIC = 16 mug/mL (36.8 muM)) and inhibited growth of species of Bacteroides (MIC=1-2 mug/mL (2.3-4.6 muM)). Similarly, @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ inhibited @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ strains (MICs = <=1-2 mug/mL (0.7-1.4 muM)) and exhibited weak activity against Bacteroides spp (MICs = 32-64 mug/mL (22.1-44.2 muM)). Although HSGN-218 was similar to @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$, the anti-CDI drug of choice, in inhibiting the growth of certain species of the normal microbiota, it must be noted that HSGN-218 inhibits C. difficile at concentrations that are 100-times less than what is needed to inhibit Bacteroides (compare Table 2 with Table 5). On the other hand, @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ inhibited both C. difficile and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ strains with comparable MIC values of 1-2 mug/mL.	3
Description of @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ porci sp. nov.: @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ porci (por'ci. L. gen. n. porci of a pig). The closest phylogenetic neighbour within family Peptoniphilaceae (phylum Firmicutes) is Anaerococcus vaginalis, which shares a 16S rRNA gene sequence identity of 96.7%. The dDDH and ANI values of 22.2% and 81%, respectively, between the two genomes confirm the separate species status. Values between the isolate and @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, the type species of the genus, are 22.5% and <80.0%. Cells grow as diplococci, are strictly anaerobic and stain Gram-positive. The genome encodes transporter systems for phosphate, alkanesulfonate, proline, monosaccharides, biotin, zinc, and d-methionine. Starch, trehalose, N-acetylmuramate, cellobiose, @sm$ maltose @/sm$, arbutin, salicin, and sucrose were identified as potential substrates. However, only starch, @sm$ maltose @/sm$, and trehalose enter glycolysis whilst the others undergo initial conversion and no subsequent reactions.	2
Eleven strains of @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ isolated from 10 Peruvian children with diarrhea were examined. All the strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, most commonly ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$. The strains were all negative in the Sereny and cell culture assays used to test for enteroinvasiveness. One strain showed cytotoxic activity on Vero cells. The strains showed no antigenic relationship with Shigella organisms. Both bioassays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used for detection of Escherichia coli enterotoxins were negative. Nucleic acid probes for such toxins likewise gave negative results. The strains all possessed a large (approximately 200-megadalton) plasmid in addition to one or more other plasmids. Several different plasmid profiles were observed among these 11 @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ strains, indicating that the isolates were not acquired from a common source or from a single bacterial clone.	4
Equol and O-DMA can be metabolized from @sm$ daidzein @/sm$ in the gut by several bacterium strains, such as Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$, Lactococcus garvieae, Slackia equolifaciens, Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, Slackia sp.	2
Finally, the red module, which was associated with low-risk CAGs, was enriched in multiple microbial taxa positively associated with a healthy microbiome, as these microbes have the ability to degrade complex @sm$ polysaccharides @/sm$ to produce beneficial SCFAs (e.g., @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$, Bacteroides pectinophilus, B.	2
Five @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ strains isolated from retail or wild-catch Louisiana blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were examined for resistance to selected antibiotics and presence of plasmids. Three agar media, MacConkey, Salmonella-Shigella and a modification of inositol brilliant green bile salt (IBB), were evaluated for isolation of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$. Of these, IBB was most satisfactory for distinguishing between @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ and the related species Aeromonas hydrophila. Isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline, and were resistant to ampicillin, @sm$ carbenicillin @/sm$, kanamycin and streptomycin. Each isolate carried three plasmids of approximately 2.5 kb, 3.8 kb and 5.3 kb. Plasmid curing with ethidium bromide and elevated temperature linked the streptomycin resistance determinant with the 3.8 kb and/or 5.3 kb plasmids. These results provide the first description of small size plasmids in @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$. Identical antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates indicated they share a common environment and likely share a common mode for developing antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, emergence of antibiotic-resistant @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ may imply contamination of Louisiana aquatic environments by wastewater.	4
For instance, germ-free and antibiotic-treated animals have altered levels of circulating TRP, KYN and @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ which can be normalized post-colonization. The production of @sm$ 5-HT @/sm$ by enterochromaffin cells of the gut is regulated by spore-forming bacteria like Clostridiales and SCFAs. In the present study, we explored the potential associations between bacteria and bacterial metabolites with the plasma levels of TRP metabolites. First, we found that circulating TRP was positively correlated with several bacteria known as SCFA producers, such as Prevotella, Odoribacter, Butyricimonas, Parabacteroidetes, @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$.	0
For the @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ species, both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B were totally resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and @sm$ streptomycin @/sm$. In addition to the three drugs, S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B were also significantly resistant to chloramphenicol and spectinomycin, respectively. These findings are consistent with other studies in which it was noted that there was an increase in the number of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolates being resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole.	4
From the cultures of these cases were isolated Brachyspira aalborgii and @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$. The frequency of the incidence of brachyspirae depended on the socio-economic living conditions of people. Colonization of the mucosa of the large gut was found more often in human populations in the developing countries; it was fairly rare in countries with high hygienic standards. An exception were men of homosexual orienation and patients presenting with a HIV infection. Isolation of brachyspirae from the faeces and biopsy of the mucosa of the large gut are fairly demanding jobs, especially with B. aalborgii. Most documented IS cases of this aetiology were diagnosed using immunohistochemical methods and amplification of the genus-specific region of the gene 16S rRNA. Isolation of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ tends to be simpler, it requires anaerobic incubation on selective blood agars for a period of 3-6 days at 37 degrees C. When manual haemoculture systems were used, patients in a critical state presented a translocation of brachyspirae into blood circulation, while automatic systems don't necessarily diagnose spirochetaemia. In the management of described cases of invasive IS particularly successful proved metronidazole and beta-lactam antibiotics. In isolated @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$, in vitro tests confirmed sensitivity to metronidazole, ceftriaxone, meropenem, @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, moxifloxacine and chloramphenicol.	3
However, it inhibited the growth of Actinomyces viscosus (MIC = 2 mug/ml), Lactobacillus crispatus (MIC = 32 mug/ml), Lactobacillus johnsonii (MICs = 8 to 16 mug/ml), @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ (MICs = 4 mug/ml), and Fusobacterium periodonticum (MIC = 8 mug/ml). Addition of 5% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep blood diminished the activity of ebselen. As a control, @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ inhibited these strains with MICs of 0.5 to 8.0 mug/ml, except against Bacteroides sp.	3
Hyperchlorination of a @gm$ Legionella @/gm$-contaminated hospital water system resulted in a dramatic decrease (30% to 1.5%) in the isolation of @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$ from water outlets and a cessation of health care-associated legionnaires' disease in the affected unit. Chloramine T and @sm$ hypochlorites @/sm$ have been used in disinfecting hydrotherapy equipment.	3
In addition, strain CLD22003 that grew on MM supplemented with FOS was identified as @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$ (Actinobacteria) with 100% coverage and 99.79% identity with multiple strains including DMS 20098. The FOS metabolism of @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$ was confirmed by growth on MM supplemented with FOS as a sole @sm$ carbohydrate @/sm$ source and a strong uptake of the NYST-F probe, as measured by cytometry (Fig. 5c). The genus Bifidobacterium is well-known for FOS metabolism in studies involving diets enriched by FOS supplementation, and @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$ is a known consumer in vitro.	2
In vitro antibacterial activity of the new macrolide @sm$ azithromycin @/sm$ was tested against 116 strains of @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, isolated from 115 patients in a major tertiary care referral center. Eighty-seven percent of the strains were inhibited by 1.0 mg/l and all the 116 strains by 2.0 mg/l of @sm$ azithromycin @/sm$.	3
Increased @sm$ GABA @/sm$ production in cecal content of @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ colonized mice has also been demonstrated in previous pilot studies using mice pretreated with antibiotics (Fig. S2). A trend toward increased @sm$ GABA @/sm$ production was observed in mice receiving gadB-positive @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ compared with the gadB-negative B. breve (P>0.05; 14.2 +- 2.5 vs 5.4 +- 0.9 mug/g cecal content; n=6 per group). The increased @sm$ GABA @/sm$ accumulation was not due to altered survival or transit of the bacteria since similar bacterial counts were measured in extracted cecal content (P>0.05; 1.7 x 107 and 6.7 x 107 copies of @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ and B. breve, respectively; n=6 per group) (Fig. S2). Taken altogether, these data demonstrate that the gadB gene from B. dentium ATCC 27678 is sufficient to facilitate @sm$ GABA @/sm$ production in vivo when cloned into other bacterial species, and that expression of the microbial gadB gene in vivo can result in significant increases in host intestinal @sm$ GABA @/sm$ concentrations.	1
Interestingly, species inherited from the mother fecal microbiome, such as Bacteroides vulgatus, @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium bifidum, were negatively associated with acylcarnitines exclusively in the neonatal period (Figure 3a, and Table S3-1). Other members of the neonatal microbiome, such as Bifidobacterium animalis and Clostridium perfringens, were positively correlated with @sm$ L-carnitine @/sm$ and short-chain acylcarnitines (Figure 3a, and Table S3-1).	0
It has been proposed for @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ that catabolism of Neu5Ac is important for enteropathogenesis. A nanA mutant was shown to be incapable of utilizing Neu5Ac as a carbon source and was defective for intestinal colonization. This group also proposed that @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ catabolism is important in virulence as the nanA mutant exhibited decreased cytotoxicity towards INT-407 epithelial cells, decreased adherence in vitro, and also displayed decreases in histopathological damage in the jejunum and colon tissues from the mouse intestine. The Nan cluster of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ has been shown to be transcriptionally repressed by NanR, and is induced by the presence of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6P) which specifically binds to NanR. The interaction between ManNAc-6P and NanR has been shown to be important in @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ pathogenesis. A mutant strain containing a NanR mutation that prevented binding of the ligand, ManNAc-6P, was shown to have growth impairment when @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ was the sole carbon source and the mutant strain was also less fit than the wild type strain in vivo, displaying decreased virulence. Together, these results demonstrate that catabolism of @sm$ sialic acid @/sm$ is a feature of clinical isolates and is an important component of survival and virulence in vivo in @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, a food-borne pathogen.	2
It has been reported that fermentable @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ such as dietary fiber, resistant starch, and oligosaccharide within whole grain rice may improve gut health by regulating the microbial fermentation pathway in the intestine. Dietary rice bran increased beneficial microbial communities such as @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota of pigs. Fermentation of indigestible @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ in brown rice by native intestinal probiotics such as @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium generates short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acids, propionic acids, and butyric acids. SCFAs reduce intestinal pH, thereby inhibiting the growth of pathogens to maintaining intestinal health and play an important role in the prevention of intestinal inflammation and diseases and served as a primary energy source for the colonic mucosa. It is possible that ground brown rice supplementation attributes fermentation and SCFAs production in the colon, and thus improves the formation of mucins and gut health. Ground brown rice supplementation decreased the relative abundance of genera Clostridium and Prevotella caused by increased genera @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in the current study, which is in agreement with results of previous data, suggesting that brown rice supplementation suppresses pathogenic bacteria that cause intestinal diseases and promotes beneficial probiotic bacteria. Therefore, ground brown rice supplementation may improve immune status and gut health of weanling pigs by increasing the relative abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$.	2
It is possible to induce @sm$ chloramphenicol @/sm$-resistance in @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$ in vitro and to isolate mutants with different levels of resistance by different techniques.	4
Its main purpose is @sm$ H2 @/sm$/CO2 utilization for acetate production. In addition to acetate, B. hydrogenotrophica produces ethanol, lactate, and lower amounts of isobutyrate and isovalerate. Glucose and fructose are the main carbon sources for fermentation. Clostridium paraputrificum is a pathogen that causes several diseases in humans, such as bacteremia and myonecrosis. A study showed that C. paraputrificum causes necrotizing cellulitis of the abdominal wall. The bacterium utilizes glucose to produce @sm$ H2 @/sm$ and CO2. The amount and composition of the end products are affected by the pH of the environment. C. paraputrificum also produces propionate and acetate as the main organic acid products, and the production of lactate and butyrate was also observed, but at lower flux values. The amount and type of organic acid produced affects the @sm$ H2 @/sm$ yield rate. @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ aerofacians is a bacterium isolated from human feces. @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ genus produces ethanol, formate, @sm$ H2 @/sm$, and lactate with fermentation.	1
Key players in acne that may emerge as targets for future acne treatments include the cutaneous loss of diversity of Cutibacterium (formerly @gm$ Propionibacterium) acnes @/gm$ phylotypes and the insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling pathway. New data about the loss of diversity of microbiota in acne provides the rationale for the potential use of oral or topical probiotics. Another therapeutic approach to modulate the microbiota could be topical formulation of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ bacteriophages to target specifically the pathogenic 'acnegenic' @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ phylotypes. Insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin, @sm$ myo-inositol @/sm$ and d-chiro-inositol represent promising agents, but to date there have been only limited studies and much heterogeneity in the methods of assessing acne efficacy outcomes.	1
Melaninogenica (56%), 10 @gm$ P. Denticola @/gm$ (14%), 7 P. Nigrescens (10%), 7 P. Salivae (10%), 3 P. Intermedia (4,3%), 2 P. Oralis (2,9%), 1 P. Baronie (1,4%) and 1 P. Disiens (1,4%). The strains analysed show resistance to Penicillin (MIC90 >8 mg/L), amoxicillin (MIC90 > 32 mg/L), @sm$ clindamycin @/sm$ (MIC90 > 64 mg/L) and piperacillin (MIC90 = 64 mg/L).	4
Nitrites or @sm$ nitrates @/sm$ are widely used in the manufacture of most meat products to preserve them from microbial growth. In addition, they produce an effective inhibition for heat-resistant spores, specifically for neurotoxin-producing @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$ strains, and in cooperation with heat treatment can prevent food spoilage and the multiplication of food-poisoning microorganisms. @sm$ Nitrates @/sm$ or @sm$ nitrates @/sm$ have also entered the manufacturing process of the majority of meat products due to their ability to give the acceptable characteristic red color, flavor, and aroma, as well as to retard lipid oxidation by the chelation of metal ions.	3
Of note, the decrease in postprandial glycemia was only observed in subjects with higher exhaled H2, assessed upon @sm$ lactulose @/sm$ breath test performed at inclusion. CG decreased a family belonging to Actinobacteria phylum and increased 3 bacterial taxa: Erysipelotrichaceae UCG.003, Ruminococcaceae UCG.005 and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ group.	0
One hundred and five @gm$ shigella @/gm$ isolates from Addis Ababa were studied to determine serogroup frequency and in vitro antibacterial drug sensitivity. About 70% of the isolates were @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$ followed by Sh. dysenteriae (15%), Sh. boydii (10%) and Sh. sonnei (5%). All or most of the strains were susceptible to cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, polymyxin B and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Frequencies of susceptibility to ampicillin, @sm$ carbenicillin @/sm$ and chloramphenicol were, respectively, 79, 80 and 75%.	3
One of the main features of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ in sessile conditions was its potential to use amino sugars released from the cell wall of lysed bacteria as a @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source. These amino sugars are catabolized via the amino sugar pathway, for which a cluster of four genes was up-regulated (nan, SXYL_00403-406, Table 1 and Figure 4). A complete nan system was defined as one that minimally includes orthologues of genes encoding NanA, NanE, and NanK. This is the case with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$, which also comprises a transcriptional regulator of the RpiR family (Table 1). The nan systems of E. coli and S. aureus also include a regulator, albeit very different from each other and not characterized for S. aureus. This nan pathway led to N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate, which could be further catabolized to pyruvate via several steps (Figure 4). In addition, in @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ in biofilm, four genes involved in the pentose and glucuronate pathways were overexpressed (Table 1). Pyruvate could be catabolized by enzymes encoded by cidC, budA and ilvNB as described above (Figure 4) but all other genes involved in its catabolism and in the TCA cycle were down-regulated (Table S2). Finally, two cydBA genes encoding cytochrome oxidase, which generates a proton motive force, were overexpressed (Table 1). In E. coli, cytochrome bd oxidase was expressed under O2-limited conditions. This suggests that @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ embedded in an eDNA matrix as observed by microscopy seems to perceive an anaerobic environment as revealed by the transcriptomic data related to the catabolism of sugars.	1
One open reading frame, designated magA, encodes a polypeptide which is homologous to the cation efflux proteins, the Escherichia coli potassium ion-translocating protein, KefC, and the putative Na+/H(+)-antiporter, NapA, from @gm$ Enterococcus hirae @/gm$. Northern hybridization demonstrated that the magA mRNA transcript is 1.3 kilobases in size, corresponding to the size of the magA gene. A functional promoter was located upstream from the magA gene, and the transcription in AMB-1 was regulated by environmental @sm$ iron @/sm$ concentration. Vesicles isolated from E. coli in which the MagA protein was expressed exhibited @sm$ iron @/sm$ accumulation ability. We consider that the MagA protein is an @sm$ iron @/sm$ transport involved in the synthesis of magnetic particles in AMB-1.	1
Other intermediate fermentation products including @sm$ lactate @/sm$ and succinate produced by many HGM species also do not accumulate to high levels in the colon since they are extensively involved in bacterial cross-feeding, serving as substrates for butyrate and propionate producers. For example, in vitro co-culture studies demonstrated that acetate and @sm$ lactate @/sm$ produced during fermentation of poly- and oligosaccharides by Bifidobacterium adolescentis support the growth of butyrate-producing strains of @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$, Roseburia and Eubacterium species with progressive increase in butyrate formation.	2
Our finding in the present study revealed the characterization of endophytic bacteria belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, and Rahnella. Pseudomonas is one of the most versatile bacteria with a dynamic distribution of species that adapted to different ecological environments. Pseudomonas species were previously reported as As-resistant endophytic bacteria in contaminated areas (Gu et al.,). Moreover, the existence of species from @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ and Rahnella genera as endophytic bacteria with plant growth promotion activity has also been reported by many researchers (He et al.,; Suzuki et al.,). All identified strains could grow in media, containing a high concentration of As, which displayed the minimum inhibitory concentration of 300-350 mM for @sm$ sodium arsenate @/sm$ under our experimental conditions.	4
Out of 539 acute diarrhoea cases studied, @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ was isolated as a sole pathogen in the faeces of 7 (1.3%) cases. The chief clinical presentations of the seven cases were watery diarrhoea and vomiting. Bloody diarrhoea was observed in 2 (28.5%), abdominal pain in 2 (28.57%) and fever in one (14.29) cases. All cases could be effectively treated with ORS except 3 (42.85%) cases who required IV Ringer's lactate. All @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains isolated in the study were uniformly susceptible to @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.	3
pneumophila as judged by broth dilution MICs were (in order of activity) azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$ and dirithromycin. The most active inhibitors of L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication were (in order of activity) azithromycin, @sm$ erythromycin @/sm$, quinupristin/dalfopristin, roxithromycin, dirithromycin and clarithromycin. All the agents were highly active against Legionella micdadei and @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$ when compared with L.	3
Pomegranate extract increased @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ by 47-fold in healthy metabolite urolithin A producers compared to non-producers. However, kiwifruit capsules did not have a significant effect on @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ abundance in healthy and functionally constipated individuals. @sm$ Resveratrol @/sm$ supplementation led to an increase in @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in USA Caucasians, but not in other ethnic groups.	3
Post-operative infection by @sm$ methicillin @/sm$-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ caused sepsis and further elevation of the leukocytes to greater than 50,000/mm3.	4
prausnitzii, @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, and the E. rectale/Roseburia group. Previous studies have found that increased consumption of B vitamins (in particular riboflavin, cobalamin, folate, and @sm$ pyridoxine @/sm$) is associated with a higher abundance of these gut bacteria.	2
Products of both cloned genes liberated arabinose from arabinan and @sm$ arabinoxylan @/sm$. The deduced amino acid sequences of ArfI and ArfII revealed numerous regions that were identical to each other and to regions of homologous proteins from Bacteroides ovatus, @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$, and Clostridium stercorarium.	0
Results: A total of 109 @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ and 12 Yersinia isolates were analyzed. C. jejuni (93/109; 85.3%), and C. coli (16/109; 14.7%) were the types encountered. Among the patients with @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ and Yersinia 4.6% and 50% were of foreign nationality, respectively. The nonsusceptibility rates found for @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ were: amoxicillin, 33.9%; amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, 5.5%; tetracycline, 34.9%; gentamicin, 0.9%; ciprofloxacin, 54.1% and erythromycin, 19.3%. All isolates were susceptible to @sm$ carbapenems @/sm$.	3
Since the essential nutrients for plants mainly include @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$, phosphorus, and iron, among PBM selection tests, @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ fixation, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production are widely investigated. One of the essential macro-elements for synthesizing proteins and nucleic acids is @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$. It has been reported that PGPB strains such as Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Achromobacter, Rhizobium and @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ can fix biological @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ via decreasing @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ gas (@sm$ N2 @/sm$) to ammonia (NH3). Moreover, phosphorus is an urgent plant nutrient for growth, which participates as a structural ingredient of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some PGPB strains such as Rhizobium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, and Azospirillium can dissolve phosphate and convert insoluble organic and inorganic phosphate into available plant form, which are called phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Organic acids (gluconic or keto-gluconic acids) produced by PSB along with their carboxyl and hydroxyl ions chelate cations and reduce pH to release phosphorus. Furthermore, PGPB act a main role in metabolic and biochemical pathways, especially for biological @sm$ nitrogen @/sm$ fixation and photosynthesis.	2
The @sm$ ammonia @/sm$ concentration in the gastric juice from @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ positive cases was significantly higher than that from negative cases, and there was positive correlation between number of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$, gastritis score and @sm$ ammonia @/sm$ concentration in gastric juice. It is suggested that @sm$ ammonia @/sm$ in gastric juice which is produced by powerful urease activity of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ is one of the pathogenic factors in gastritis. We succeeded in producing a urease-negative mutant strain of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$. This strain did not colonize gastric mucosa of Cynomolgus monkeys. @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ survival time in vitro was increased at pH 2.0 in the presence of urea. These results suggest that urease facilitates colonization of gastric mucosa by @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$, and prolongs the survival of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ in an acidic environment.	1
The complete metabolism of lignans and bile acids to @sm$ ENL @/sm$ and secondary bile acid species, respectively, can occur in a single organism with the complete metabolic pathway or in a consortia of bacteria whose genome content completes the full metabolic pathway. The large number of bacteria that expressed bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in stool or the in vitro incubations suggests that this is not a rate limiting step in secondary bile acid production. However, the high inter-individual variation in the BSH and dehydrogenases suggests that the gut microbiome may influence inter-individual variation in the speciation of secondary bile acids. The positive association between @sm$ ENL @/sm$ production and gene expression of the bai cluster and dehydrogenases suggests overlap in community metabolism of secondary bile acids and @sm$ ENL @/sm$. Additionally, gene expression for secondary bile acid metabolism was enriched in the @sm$ ENL @/sm$, producing in vitro incubations. We identified @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ and Gordonibacter pamelaceae in the in vitro incubations. Both of these organisms not only have a complete bai gene cluster which is involved in the conversion of primary to secondary bile acids, but they have recently been identified as part of a consortium of bacteria that produce @sm$ ENL @/sm$. Our previous work showed that the microbial composition at the baseline was positively associated with @sm$ ENL @/sm$ production in this cohort, reinforcing that the microbial community involved in ENL production may impact secondary bile acid production.	1
The compounds were added to 5 ml of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ cultures (OD595 of ~0.3 to 0.4) and incubated at 37 C for 2 h, and 1 microCi/ml of [14C]acetate (56 mCi/mmol) was added to each culture, followed by incubation at 37 C for another 4 h. The 14C-labeled cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH), and incubated overnight at 100 C to hydrolyze cell wall-bound lipids. The fatty acids were esterified by adding 4 ml CH2Cl2, 300 microl @sm$ iodomethane @/sm$, and 2 ml distilled water (dH2O) and mixing at room temperature for 1 h; then, the phases were separated by centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the lower organic phase was washed twice with dH2O, dried, and resuspended in 3 ml of diethyl ether.	0
The concentration of @sm$ formic acid @/sm$ in all fermented samples was the same (p > 0.05) and its value was three-times lower than that in the unfermented milk. The concentration of acetic acid significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the samples fermented with monoculture of @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ 16t compared to the unfermented milk; at the same time, its concentration significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the samples fermented with three-strain cultures. Expectedly, lactic acid was not detected in the unfermented milk. The highest concentration of lactic acid was detected in the milk fermented with individual L. delbrueckii strains (Lb100 and Lb200), while the lowest concentration was in the milk fermented with a monoculture of @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ 16t.	0
The concern of unknown pathogenic infection was denied due to the result of mNGS showed that there were only 22 reads of Brucella with no new etiology or @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$. Therefore, we replaced doxycycline, @sm$ rifampin @/sm$, and cefatriaxone for anti-infection treatment. After a continued new treatment of 20 days, the condition of the patient was gradually stabilized and discharged. This was a rare case of CNS infection with @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$, which lasted for days after the acute exacerbation.	3
The core OTU belonging to the Spirochaetes annotated as @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ 2 accounted for 3.4% of the prokaryotic community/animal in this study, and at the genus level @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ 2 comprised 8.4%. The genus @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ was reported to be lower in relative abundance in other studies (1.9% and 2.9%) but consistent with this study was present in all 18 of the animals in the study of Steelman et al.. In the study of Daly et al., the majority of the Spirochaetes cloned sequences clustered with the known species Treponema bryantii and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$. Neither of these species are considered to be pathogenic, unlike several of the other 20 species listed within the @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ 2 genus in the SILVA database . Treponema bryantii utilizes fermentable substrates, in particular soluble sugars released from cellulose by cellulolytic bacteria such as Fibrobacter (formerly Bacteroides) succinogenes. @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$ is strictly saccharolytic, can ferment pentoses, hexoses and disaccharides, and produces relatively large amounts of succinate from @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and CO2.	2
The emergence of @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$ and ampicillin resistance in clinical @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ strains and the ascension of this species as an important nosocomial pathogen are among the more remarkable developments in the past decade. This emergence and spread is due to both the failure to adhere to well-established infection control measures and the persistent selective antibiotic pressure exerted in tertiary care institutions. Accumulating data specifically implicate the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria in the spread of @sm$ vancomycin @/sm$-resistant enterococci (VRE).	4
The first complete genome of strain UCN34 provided clear insights for its adaptation to the rumen with the discovery of a high number of enzymes involved in complex @sm$ carbohydrates @/sm$ degradation and in tannin detoxification. SGG is also an opportunistic pathogen causing septicemia and endocarditis in the elderly who often have concomitant colon tumors. SGG was formerly known as S. bovis biotype I belonging to the large S. bovis/equinus complex, which is comprised of several opportunistic pathogens and nonpathogenic bacteria. In this complex, SGG is assigned into a clade with two other closely related subspecies named @gm$ S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus @/gm$ (referred to here as @gm$ SGP @/gm$) and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus (referred to here as SGM). @gm$ SGP @/gm$ can cause neonatal meningitis whereas SGM is generally recognized as a safe nonpathogenic strain.	1
The gut microbiota can also participate in cross-feeding, where metabolic intermediates (such as @sm$ acetate @/sm$, lactate, succinate and formate) that are produced by gut commensals can act as nutrients to support the growth of other gut commensals. For example, members of the Bacteroidota and Negativicutes can convert succinate into propionate. Multiple commensal species within Pseudomonadota and Bacillota, such as   Anaerobutyricum hallii  ,   Desulfovibrio piger   and   @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$  , can convert lactate to @sm$ acetate @/sm$, propionate and butyrate.	1
The hyl gene, encoding a glycosil-hydrolase, was identified in two @sm$ tetracycline @/sm$-resistant @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ isolates and one showed the intermediate phenotype of vancomycin resistance.	4
The in vitro action of @sm$ sisomicin @/sm$, gentamicin and tobramycin against 62 strains of Mycobacterium fortuitum and 20 strains of @gm$ M. chelonei @/gm$ was investigated. At a drug concentration of 4 micrograms/ml, 31, 31 and 11%, respectively, of M. fortuitum strains and 90, 25 and 15%, respectively, of @gm$ M. chelonei @/gm$ strains, were inhibited.	3
The in vitro activities of five new @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ (clinafloxacin [CI-960 or PD-127391], BAY Y 3118, E-4868, E-5065, and E-5068) against 100 Bacteroides fragilis group bacterial isolates were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. Overall, E-5068 was the most active in vitro (MIC for 90% of isolates tested [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml); this was followed by clinafloxacin and BAY Y 3118 (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ofloxacin were the least active (MIC90s, 64, 16, and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). B. fragilis and @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ were more susceptible than the other members of the B. fragilis group to all of the @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ tested.	3
"The in vitro activity of @sm$ cefmenoxime @/sm$ (SCE 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other ""third generation"" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. @sm$ Cefmenoxime @/sm$ as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. @sm$ Cefmenoxime @/sm$ was the most active against Serratia marcescens, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, @sm$ cefmenoxime @/sm$ and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains."	3
The major gluconeogenic aldolase FBAP is expected to play an important role during growth of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ with @sm$ carbon @/sm$ sources requiring gluconeogenesis such as acetate or propionate. The glyoxylate shunt genes have not only been annotated, but shown to function as their heterologous expression complemented a glyoxylate deficient C. glutamicum mutant and their overexpression improved (R)-acetoin production by a metabolically engineered strain of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$. The genome of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ also encodes propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, thus, providing ability to grow on propionic acid. The two chromosomally encoded and the plasmid encoded NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenases have been shown to oxidize other alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, isopropanol, 1,2-propanediol, and 1,3-propanediol) besides methanol. This may increase the @sm$ carbon @/sm$ source spectrum to include ethanol besides acetate, propanol, propionate, and possibly more alcohols that require gluconeogenesis to support growth of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$. Future work has to address if the amino acid changes introduced here into FBAP affect the ability of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$ to grow with these C2 and C3 carbon sources.	2
The monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that CDA-0.05 was composed of @sm$ glucose @/sm$ and galactose in a molar ratio of 96.4: 3.6. The backbone of CDA-0.05 contained 1, 4-linked alpha-D-Glcp, 1, 4, 6-linked alpha-D-Glcp and 1, 4-linked beta-D-Galp, with branches of T-linked alpha-D-Glcp attached at C-6 of 1, 4, 6-linked alpha-D-Glcp residues. Bioactivity test results suggested that CDA-0.05 could promote the growth of three species of Bacteroides (@gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, B.	2
The phylogenetic analysis performed using a set of 31 conserved housekeeping protein-coding genes revealed that the CPCRI-1 and CPCRI-3 genomes were closely related to the @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ group (Fig. 2A). The CPCRI-2 genome was found to be closely related to the Pseudomonas putida group. CPCRI-1 grouped with Enterobacter asburiae strain LF7a and @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 13047 @/gm$, both of which are members of the @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ complex. CPCRI-3 clustered closely with Enterobacter asburiae strain LF7a and Enterobacter sp. 638, an endophyte of poplar trees. The closest relative to CPCRI-2 was Pseudomonas putida strain S16, a gram-negative soil bacterium with an ability to degrade aromatic and heterocyclic compounds, such as @sm$ nicotine @/sm$, benzoate, and phenylalanine.	2
The results for isolates of Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium gordonae, @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonei agreed 100% with the expected results. Of the 177 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 4 were negative by the conventional method. Two of these four isolates were positive with the new reagent. Of the positive @sm$ nitrate @/sm$ tests carried out with liquid reagents, 42% flashed instantly or faded in color; none of the tests carried out with the new crystalline reagent flashed or faded.	0
The same concentration (0.25 mg/mL) was able to inhibit more than 50% of the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (82.86% +- 1.94%) and @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (79.92% +- 1.23%) growth (Figure 2B). The antimicrobial activity of phenolic compounds occurring in plant foods has been widely studied against a wide range of microorganisms. The damage to the bacterial membrane and suppression of some virulence factors, including enzymes and toxins, are suggested to be the mechanisms of their antimicrobial action. Some flavonoids (rutin, @sm$ myricetin @/sm$, and quercetin) and phenolic acids (gallic, caffeic, and ferulic acids) of PSF extract may be responsible for its antibacterial action.	3
The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and @sm$ cefoperazone @/sm$ was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. @sm$ Cefoperazone @/sm$ had potent activity against Ps.	3
The trans-aconitate-oxidizing bacterium was identified as @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, and it converted trans-aconitate to @sm$ acetate @/sm$, a nontoxic end product of ruminal fermentation. When S. ruminantium and A. fermentans were cocultured with trans-aconitate and glucose, tricarballylate never accumulated and all the trans-aconitate was converted to @sm$ acetate @/sm$.	1
"Three saccaharolytic groups were further divided into nine subgroups by the fermentation patterns of sucrose, @sm$ lactose @/sm$, maltose and rhamnose. Two saccaharolytic subgroups were identified as Treponema socranskii, and two asaccharolytic groups were identified as ""T. denticola"" and ""@gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$""."	1
Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that catabolism of @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ by the @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ GTSP, which produces H2S, will induce host cell death. To assess this possibility, wild type and Deltaggt cells were incubated with hGF cells, in the presence or absence of @sm$ glutathione @/sm$. After 24 hours, Annexin V and propidium iodide staining was used to measure cell death. Dead hGFs include early apoptotic cells (Annexin V positive/propidium iodide low), late apoptotic cells (V+/propidium iodide high) and necrotic hGFs (propidium iodide high) (Fig. 5A). Gingival fibroblasts incubated with wild type @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ and @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ had significantly more cell death than hGFs grown with wild type bacteria without @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ (Fig. 5B). This induction required the GTSP since Deltaggt cells with @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ induced much less host cell death (12%) than did wild type bacteria with @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ (52%). These results correlated well (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.97) with the levels of H2S in the same samples (Fig. 5C). For example, the media from hGFs incubated with mutant @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ and @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ had 0.13 mM H2S, whereas wild type bacteria produced 1.56 mM H2S from @sm$ glutathione @/sm$. The results demonstrate that the GTSP plays a major role in the ability of @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ to induce cell death in human gingival fibroblasts and strongly argue that it is the production of H2S from @sm$ glutathione @/sm$ that leads to gingival fibroblast death.	2
To examine whether Acs or PrpE can catalyze @sm$ lactate @/sm$ to lactyl-CoA, we incubated purified Acs with acetate or @sm$ lactate @/sm$ and PrpE with propionate or @sm$ lactate @/sm$, respectively. However, we observed that neither Acs nor PrpE could catalyze the formation of lactyl-CoA from @sm$ lactate @/sm$ (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d, f, g). It has been recently reported that five CoA transferases from different species, including @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$, Clostridium propionicum, Megasphaera sp. DISK 18, Clostridium lactatifermentans An75 and Firmicutes bacterium CAG:466 can convert @sm$ lactate @/sm$ to lactyl-CoA. After a BLAST search, we found that acetate CoA-transferase (Ydif) in E. coli has high sequence conservation with the five transferases, especially in motifs EXGXXG and GXGGF (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Thus, we incubated purified YdiF with acetate or @sm$ lactate @/sm$. Interestingly, we found that YdiF could catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA or lactyl-CoA from acetate or @sm$ lactate @/sm$ in vitro (Fig. 2a, b), suggesting that Ydif has lactyl-CoA-transferase activity. To confirm its intracellular catalytic activity, we further analyzed Kac and Kla levels in the YdiF-overexpressing E. coli BL21 (lambdaDE3) strain (pYdiF). Compared with E. coli harboring the empty pET28a vector, we found that the pYdiF strain caused a significant increase in Kac and Kla levels (Fig. 2c). Together, our results demonstrate that lactyl-CoA does exist in E. coli and that YdiF can serve as a lactyl-CoA-transferase for the conversion of lactyl-CoA from @sm$ lactate @/sm$.	2
Treponema denticola and @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ were found to require albumin, oleic acid, and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) for growth. Previous studies indicated that commercial human alpha globulin, which is 50% albumin, was the only serum fraction that supported growth of these two oral treponemes. The alpha-globulin proteins were separated from the contaminating albumin with Affi-Gel Blue affinity chromatography. Both the albumin fraction and one of the alpha-globulin fractions were required for growth of T. denticola. Oleic acid was supplied by the alpha-globulin fraction and the albumin functioned as a chelator to maintain a low level of free fatty acid in the medium. Purified serum albumin (bovine or human) could substitute for the alpha-globulin fraction that contained albumin. Optimal growth of T. denticola and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ was in a medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) delipified albumin, 0.08 mg/mL of sodium oleate, and 25 micrograms/mL of TPP. Serum albumin tightly bound TPP (0.5 microgram of TPP per milligram of albumin). Optimal growth of T. denticola was only in an albumin-oleate supplemented medium with sufficient TPP to saturate the albumin binding sites and provide excess free TPP. Albumin bound long-chain fatty acids and thus detoxified the medium. Neither starch- nor charcoal-treated @sm$ Tween 80 @/sm$ (polysorbitan monooleate) replaced albumin for optimal growth.	0
Twelve isolates from the six affected infants were identified as @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ by the use of a novel method, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Typing of the organisms using the biochemical profiles of the API 20NE system, antibiogram typing, cell envelope protein electrophoresis, and PCR fingerprinting with two primer sets, ERIC1/ERIC2 and ERIC2/ 1026, showed that these 12 isolates were indistinguishable, whereas the remaining six isolates were different. The six infants recovered after therapy with @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ alone in five cases and with a combination of @sm$ ciprofloxacin @/sm$ and gentamicin in one case. This study showed that @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ is capable of causing a serious, though non-fatal infection in neonates.	3
We compared beta-glucuronidase activity from stool samples of patients receiving MMF and @sm$ tacrolimus @/sm$ post-HCT or kidney transplant. We hypothesized that, based on observed differences in therapeutic dosing regimens between transplantation types, beta-glucuronidase activity would differ between transplant types. We observed that fecal beta-glucuronidase activity was over two-fold lower in HCT patients (3.50 +- 3.29 nmol/h/g) than in kidney transplant patients (8.48 +- 6.21 nmol/h/g, P = .001; Figure 1). Previous studies have found an association of distinct intestinal microbiota with clinical outcomes including infectious complications in HCT recipients and dosing of the IS drug @sm$ tacrolimus @/sm$ (@sm$ TAC @/sm$) in kidney transplant recipients. In addition, greater abundances of the genera Blautia and Enterococcus, and decreasing abundances of clostridia have been associated with a lower incidence of GVHD-related mortality in HCT patients. In kidney transplant patients, Lee, et al. hypothesized that the abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ was associated with a healthy and diverse colon and found a positive correlation between @sm$ TAC @/sm$ dosage and @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$. This hypothesis was tested in vitro by Guo, et al. with results suggesting involvement of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ in metabolism of @sm$ TAC @/sm$.	1
We determined if enteral nutrition with anti-inflammatory fatty acids, @sm$ eicosapentaenoic acid @/sm$, and gamma-linolenic acid would reduce the intrapulmonary synthesis of proinflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines and pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in a rat model of acute lung injury. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study. SETTING: Research laboratory at a university medical center. SUBJECTS: Male Long-Evans rats (250 g). INTERVENTIONS: Rats were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups and fed nutritionally complete diets (300 kcal/kg/day) containing 55.2% of the total calories from fat with either 97% corn oil, 20% fish oil, or 20% fish and 20% borage oil for 21 days. On day 22, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 2 hrs after an intravenous injection of @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ endotoxin (10 mg/kg) or saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4/D4, thromboxane B2, prostaglandin E2, 6 keto-prostaglandin F1alpha, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Lung myeloperoxidase activity (a marker for neutrophil accumulation) and phospholipid fatty acid composition were also determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung phospholipid concentrations of arachidonic acid were lower and the concentrations of @sm$ eicosapentaenoic acid @/sm$ and docosahexaenoic acid were higher with fish oil and fish and borage oil as compared with corn oil.	2
We examined antimicrobial susceptibility and efflux systems in laboratory-derived mutants of @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ selected by culture on fluoroquinolone-containing plates. The mutants exhibited decreased susceptibilities to @sm$ quinolones @/sm$ and several other antimicrobials.	4
We identified 6 genera (Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$, Saccharomyces and Zymomonas) and 10 species (Acinetobacter boissieri, Acinetobacter nectaris, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus piscium, Lactococcus plantarum, @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$, Leuconostoc gelidum, Zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that were present >= 1% in at least one stage of pulque fermentation. The abundance of genera and species changed during fermentation and was associated with a decrease in sucrose and increases in ethanol and @sm$ lactic acid @/sm$, suggesting that resource competition shapes organismal diversity.	1
When growth at 37 degrees C, Yersinia pestis and @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ bound less polymyxin B (PMB) than pathogenic or non-pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica, regardless of virulence plasmid expression. @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ OMs were unharmed by PMB concentrations causing extensive OM blebbing in Y. enterocolitica. The permeability to lysozyme caused by PMB was greater in Y. enterocolitica than in @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ or Y. pestis and differences increased at 37 degrees C. Similar observations were made with other polycations using a polymyxin/@sm$ novobiocin @/sm$ permeability assay. With LPS of cells grown at 26 degrees C, polycation binding was highest for @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ and lowest for Y. pestis, with Y. enterocolitica yielding intermediate results which were lower for pathogenic than for non-pathogenic strains. With LPS of cells grown at 37 degrees C, polycation binding remained unchanged for Y. pestis and pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, increased for non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica and decreased for @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ to Y.	0
When testing slow-growing and/or serophilic anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, such as @gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$ or Bacteroides oralis, the supplemented Columbia Agar was enriched with 10% sterile horse serum. Discrepancies between results with the conventional tube technique and the disk method were occasionally observed with @sm$ salicin @/sm$ only.	2
While MIC equals MBC, the similarity revealed that the extract possesses potent antibacterial components against the test bacteria as showed by @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$ extract of flesh against @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ ATCC 13419 with mean MIC and MBC value of 0.625 +- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL (Table 3). The antibacterial activity of the @sm$ ethyl acetate @/sm$ and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed, and mace of Myristica fragrans indicated a broad-spectrum and great therapeutic potential of the plant as anticariogenic and antiperiodontopathic agents.	3
Within the fibre-abundant MD, intake of complex carbohydrates promotes the growth of Bifidobacteria species (Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) that are favourable for health. The fermentable (soluble) component of complex carbohydrates is associated with increased Bacteroides species and butyrate-producing bacteria such as Clostridium leptum and Eubacterium rectale. The non-fermentable (insoluble) component of complex carbohydrates (a fraction of the MD) reaches the colon and consists of plant cell wall polysaccharides (@sm$ cellulose @/sm$) and resistant starches.	0
Yersinia enterocolitica and @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ are the species that cause human GI disease. @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ is one of the most common agents of bacterial enteritis in western and northern Europe, and the incidence is rising in both Europe and the United States. These gram-negative coccobacilli may cause appendicitis, ileitis, colitis, and mesenteric lymphadenitis. Although yersiniosis is usually a self-limited process, chronic infections (including chronic colitis) have been well documented. Immunocompromised and debilitated patients, as well as patients on @sm$ deferoxamine @/sm$ or with iron overload, are at risk for serious disease.	0
