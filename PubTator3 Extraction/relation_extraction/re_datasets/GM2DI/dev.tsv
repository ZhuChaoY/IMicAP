1) suggested a role for VirB in BCV late maturation events because the intracellular fate of wild-type and virB10 @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ diverged after 4 h after infection. To clearly determine a role for VirB in BCV maturation in @di$ BMDM @/di$, we examined the vacuole maturation of the surviving GFP-expressing virB10 @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ and compared their interactions with the ER to those of the wild-type GFP-2308. Using LAMP-1 as a marker of BCV maturation (Fig. 2 C), we observed that the majority of vacuoles containing either strain were LAMP-1+ until 4 h after infection (Fig. 8, A and B) . However, although the percentage of LAMP-1+ wild-type BCVs decreased after 4 h after infection, vacuoles containing the virB10 mutant remained positive (Fig. 8, A and B), as previously described in epithelial cells. This indicates that virB mutants are deficient in controlling vacuole maturation in @di$ BMDM @/di$ after 4 h after infection.	1
@di$ ARGs @/di$ are widespread but cause problems only when present in pathogens. Virulence genes have become significant marker of pathogenic bacteria. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ possesses diverse virulence genes, located on both the chromosome and/or the plasmid.	1
@di$ ASVs @/di$ (OR 0.49 (0.33-0.67), p<0.001, and OR 0.72 (0.54-0.94), p<0.05), Lachnospiraceae edouardii (OR 0.62 (0.41-0.85), p<0.01) and Lachnoclostridium spp. (OR 0.72 (0.54-0.94), p<0.01), which all belong to the Lachnospiraceae family. In addition, Roseburia hominis (OR 0.81 (0.64-0.99), p<0.05) and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ (OR 0.72 (0.52-0.97), p<0.05) were lower abundant in patients with a positive p-tau status.	2
@di$ Dental caries @/di$ is multifactorial and depends on the interaction of several etiological factors: host, diet and microbiota. @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, a Gram-positive bacterium often found in the dental biofilm, is one of the major @di$ caries @/di$ pathogens. This species can ferment a wide variety of sugars and, at the same time, maintain healthy metabolism even at a low pH, causing enhanced tooth demineralization, which can result in more extensive @di$ caries lesion @/di$ formation.	1
@di$ Erysipelas @/di$ was diagnosed in 2 succeeding caged layer flocks housed in the same building and was characterized clinically by sudden death. At necropsy, lesions comprised generalized congestion, hemorrhages in the skeletal muscles and visceral organs, and swelling of liver, spleen, and kidney with or without large irregular zones of necrosis. Focal to massive hepatic necrosis was seen histologically with minimal or no inflammatory reaction. @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ was cultured from internal organs of affected birds in both outbreaks.	1
@di$ L. pneumophilia @/di$ at a sequence similarity of 99% was the most common potentially pathogenic bacteria that was detected from all the five hot springs in Eritrea. Other species of Legionella detected in the present study include; L. oakridgensis, L. grasilensis, L. drozanskii, L. lytica, L. jordanis, L. iondiniensis, L. dresdenensis, L. rubrilucens and L. maceachernii. The distribution of Legionella from seven hot spring recreational areas throughout Taiwan also showed the predominance of L. pneumophila (25%) in the samples, while @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$, L.	0
@di$ Osteomyelitis of the jaws @/di$ caused by a @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species is uncommon. A case of @di$ osteomyelitis of the mandible @/di$ caused by penicillin-resistant @gm$ Bacteroides ruminicola @/gm$ is reported.	1
@di$ Paratyphoid @/di$ is caused by the bacterium S. enterica of the serotypes Paratyphi A, B, or C that infect the gastrointestinal tract. Enteric fever was previously believed to be primarily caused by S. Typhi, thus, @di$ paratyphoid fever @/di$ appeared to be neglected. However, emerging data from several Asian countries including India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and China show that S. Paratyphi is also a major cause of enteric fever. @di$ Paratyphoid fever @/di$ is widely spread in Asia, where the common cause is S. Paratyphi A, but less common in Europe and caused by S. Paratyphi B. On the other hand, @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ is very rare and not common in certain destinations.	1
@di$ Periodontal infections @/di$ have a microbial etiology. Association of species with early disease would be useful in determining which microbes initiate @di$ periodontitis @/di$. We hypothesized that the microbiota of subgingival and tongue samples would differ between early @di$ periodontitis @/di$ and health. A cross-sectional evaluation of 141 healthy and early @di$ periodontitis @/di$ adults was performed with the use of oligonucleotide probes and PCR. Most species differed in associations with sample sites; most subgingival species were associated with subgingival samples. Few species were detected more frequently in early @di$ periodontitis @/di$ by DNA probes. Porphyromonas gingivalis and @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ (@gm$ Tannerella forsythensis @/gm$) were associated with early @di$ periodontitis @/di$ by direct PCR. In conclusion, the microbiota of tongue samples was less sensitive than that of subgingival samples in detecting @di$ periodontal @/di$ species, and there was overlap in species detected in health and early @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Detection of @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogens in early @di$ periodontitis @/di$ suggests an etiology similar to that of more advanced disease.	1
@di$ Peritoneal @/di$ dialysis (PD)-related @di$ peritonitis @/di$ is a common complication of PD. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a rare complication of PD-related @di$ peritonitis @/di$, has a high mortality rate, and therefore should be detected early once it occurs. We describe a case of a 70-year-old woman on PD presented with moderate abdominal pain and low blood pressure, which contributed to the early diagnosis of PD-related @di$ peritonitis @/di$ complicated with NOMI. Increased white cell count of 7150/muL (neutrophil, 84%) in dialysate effluent was diagnostic of PD-related @di$ peritonitis @/di$, which was later found to be caused by @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$. Computed tomography with contrast performed after administering crystalloids revealed hepatic portal venous gas, pneumatosis intestinalis in the ascending colon, and normal enhancement of the bowel wall and mesenteric arteries, which suggested a reperfusion of the previously ischemic ascending colon. Colonoscopy on hospital day seventeen revealed mucosal hemorrhage and ulcers in the entire right colon and the terminal ileum while the remaining colon was normal. These findings are compatible with the consequence of NOMI. Increased peak systolic velocity of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) implied its stenosis. Past studies show that ischemia of the colon in patients with chronic kidney disease commonly occurs in the right colon. Arteriosclerosis of the SMA due to the long history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes might have caused its vulnerability to low blood pressure. Abdominal complications including NOMI should be screened for when a patient presents with low blood pressure and strong abdominal pain. This is the first case report that shows colonoscopy images of the colonic ulcers post-NOMI and PD-related @di$ peritonitis @/di$.	1
@di$ Pneumonia @/di$ was common, most with recurrent infections. In terms of the etiology, these patients were at high risk for M. tuberculosis (5/7), bacterial (3/7), and fungal (1/7) infections (supplemental data 1: S1). One patient was considered to have a definite fungal infection due to a positive galactomannan (GM) test in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Bacteria including @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$, Corynebacterium striatum, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected in the pus or respiratory secretions by culture or mNGS.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ is a Gram negative, predominately nosocomial pathogen that produces different types of infections including @di$ pneumonia @/di$, bloodstream infections and meningitis, among others. Over the preceding two decades, the number of nosocomial infections caused by @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ strains that have acquired resistance to multiple antibiotic classes has increased alarmingly, and has limited the use of antibiotics that previously demonstrated activity against circulating strains. This has prompted the increasing use of colistin, often one of the few clinically-used antibiotics that retains activity against many multidrug resistant isolates. Colistin is a peptide antibiotic that targets the bacterial cell membrane through interaction with the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. Colistin was introduced into clinical use approximately 60 years ago, but its use diminished, until recently, due to concerns over nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Unfortunately, the increased use of colistin in recent years has resulted in the emergence of colistin resistant @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ is an atypical human pathogen that has been mainly associated with bacteraemia in neonates and paediatric oncology patients. Some cases of meningitis, @di$ peritonitis @/di$, ocular infection and septicaemia caused by @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ have been reported. Moreover, many recently published reports of Acinetobacter spp. harbouring blaNDM suggested Acinetobacter as the source and cause of spread for this threatening carbapenemase. The identification of blaNDM-1 was recently described in @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ clinical isolates from China.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ is one of more than 50 different species belonging to the genus @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$. This bacterium is rarely reported to cause human infections. Here we described a rare case of @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, which grew in urine culture approximately one month after the patient was discharged from the hospital with antibiotics for a @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$, which caused left obstructing renal calculi requiring nephrostomy tube placement.	1
"@gm$ Aeromonas sobria @/gm$, a member of the Aeromonas hydrophila group, recently has been recognized as a gastrointestinal pathogen in adults. There have been a few documented cases, and these have come from far eastern countries, namely India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The authors have isolated a strain of @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ from a 62-year-old male patient suffering from diarrheal disease. He had no history of travel outside of the United States for several decades. He presented with a severe diarrheal disease that closely mimicked cholera, producing large quantities of green ""rice water"" stool. He was severely @di$ dehydrated @/di$ and was in electrolyte imbalance. No other enteric pathogen could be detected. The organism presumptively was identified as Vibrio cholera (81.5% probability) by the Micro Scan system, but later was identified definitively as @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ using the API 20E and ZYM systems."	1
@gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ are pathogenic in colitis and colorectal cancer and are related to liver fibrosis and signs of depression. In @di$ hypertension @/di$, the increase in @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ was also observed to be a potential driver for gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation.	1
@gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$, Dialister invisus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum were also negatively associated with Cer(d18:1), but not with gene richness. Only one @di$ MGS @/di$ was inversely associated with DHCer and one with SM.	0
@gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ is a a facultative anaerobic, spore forming gram positive bacilli which is found in soil, environment and hospital surroundings. The bacteria when cultured on 5% sheep blood agar produces dull opaque colonies with swarming and beta hemolysis. It produces tissue destructive exoenzymes which are responsible for its pathogenicity. The bacteria is known to cause food poisoning and endophthalmitis. They can rarely cause severe infections such as bacterial pneumonia, brain abscess, meningitis, osteomyelitis, ocular keratitis, necrotizing skin and soft tissue infection . It is known to cause nosocomial acquired @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and wound infections in postsurgical patients with intravascular devices such as catheters . @gm$ B.cereus @/gm$ isolated from blood culture is most often considered as a contaminant. According to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), common skin contaminants such as @gm$ B.cereus @/gm$ when isolated from blood can be considered as a pathogen if the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of sepsis and two or more blood culture drawn on separate occasions yield the same bacteria.	1
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ exhibits pronounced tropism for reproductive tissues, especially the gravid uterus where intense multiplication occurs. Consistent with this predilection, B. suis was isolated from an undeveloped fetus and the bitch's @di$ vaginal @/di$ discharge and milk postwhelping (GD-14A). To our, knowledge, this observation is the first reported detection of B. suis from dog milk and confirms a vertical transmission pathway after whelping. Vertical transmission is a prominent feature of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ in most animal species.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species are Gram-negative bacteria that are considered the second leading cause of foodborne disease in the US. @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ causes gastrointestinal diseases characterized by @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (which is often bloody), abdominal cramping, fever, and vomiting. Campylobacteriosis is usually self-limiting, but in rare cases it has been shown to trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system that can lead to paralysis. The most common sources of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ are chicken and turkey products. Most infections occur from the improper handling or consumption of raw or undercooked meat. While @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ is more prevalent in human infections than Campylobacter coli, 95% of infections are usually due to one of these two species.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ resides in the intestine of several commonly consumed animals, as well as water and soil. It leads to campylobacteriosis when humans eat raw/undercooked meat or come into contact with infected animals. A common manifestation of the infection is fever, @di$ nausea @/di$, headache, and diarrhea. Increasing antibiotic resistance is being observed in this pathogen. The increased incidence of C. coli infection, and post-infection complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome, make it an important pathogen. It is essential to find novel therapeutic targets and drugs against it, especially with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In the current study, genomes of 89 antibiotic-resistant strains of @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ were downloaded from the PATRIC database.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$ subspecies fetus has a predilection for vascular endothelium. This report describes a case of a prosthetic valve infective endocarditis due to this microorganism. Despite adequate antibiotic combination treatment, valvular @di$ vegetations @/di$ and perivalvular suppurative complications evolved, leading to valvular dysfunction, heart failure and death. Only three other cases of @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ prosthetic valve endocarditis have been described previously.	1
@gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, a polyphyletic Gram-positive taxon of bacteria, is classified purely by their ability to produce botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT). BoNT is the primary virulence factor and the causative agent of botulism. A potentially fatal disease, botulism is classically characterized by a symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis, which is left untreated can lead to respiratory failure and death. Botulism cases are classified into three main forms dependent on the nature of intoxication; foodborne, wound and infant. The BoNT, regarded as the most potent biological substance known, is a zinc metalloprotease that specifically cleaves SNARE proteins at neuromuscular junctions, preventing exocytosis of neurotransmitters, leading to muscle paralysis. The BoNT is now used to treat numerous medical conditions caused by overactive or @di$ spastic muscles @/di$ and is extensively used in the cosmetic industry due to its high specificity and the exceedingly small doses needed to exert long-lasting pharmacological effects. Additionally, the ability to form endospores is critical to the pathogenicity of the bacteria. Disease transmission is often facilitated via the metabolically dormant spores that are highly resistant to environment stresses, allowing persistence in the environment in unfavourable conditions. Infant and wound botulism infections are initiated upon germination of the spores into neurotoxin producing vegetative cells, whereas foodborne botulism is attributed to ingestion of preformed BoNT. @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ is a saprophytic bacterium, thought to have evolved its potent neurotoxin to establish a source of nutrients by killing its host.	1
@gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ (@gm$ CB @/gm$) is probiotic that produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyric acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid. Short-chain fatty acids play a role in suppressing intestinal inflammation and maintaining normal intestinal function. @gm$ CB @/gm$ has been used to prevent or treat intestinal disorders in animals. In clinical practice, @gm$ CB @/gm$ is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with the destruction of the gastrointestinal microbiota, such as diarrhea and @di$ constipation @/di$. The administration of @gm$ CB @/gm$ has recently been reported to result in changes in the bacterial flora.	2
@gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ (reclassified in 2016 into a new Clostridiodes genus, along with Clostridium mangenotii, with which it shares a 94.7% similarity within 16 s rRNA gene) is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium, prevalent in the environment, as well as human gastrointestinal tract: it is mainly present in infants, in whom the asymptomatic colonization occurs. On the other hand, in adults, @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ colonization is characterized by life-threatening infection, with symptoms ranging from moderate @di$ diarrhea @/di$ to severe colitis and/or megacolon. In Europe, the majority (74.6%) of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ cases are healthcare-associated (HA).	1
@gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is responsible for a variety of gastrointestinal diseases in humans and animals, collectively referred to as C. difficile-infection (CDI). The pathogen is frequently associated with antibiotic treatment and the severity of CDI ranges from mild antibiotic-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ to the life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ was recognized as a pathogen only three decades ago, and the reported incidence of CDI has increased significantly in the last decade as new variants emerge. @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ is evolving rapidly as exemplified by the recent global emergence of the PCR ribotype 027 (RT027) clonal lineage associated with increased mortality and morbidity.	1
@gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ is a gram-positive rod causing swine erysipelas. It is a zoonotic infection in humans, with meat (swine) and fish handlers being at greatest risk. It most commonly causes erysipeloid, a localized cellulitis caused by direct bacterial invasion of cuts or abrasions in the skin. However, the skin infection can become generalized, and the organism can produce acute systemic septicemia. We report the case of a patient with @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ bacteremia complicated by @di$ renal failure @/di$, respiratory failure, and aortic valve endocarditis.	1
@gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ (@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$) is a well-known human pathogen that plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric malignancies. Although @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ is susceptible to several antimicrobials, this @di$ infection @/di$ has proven challenging to cure because of the increasing prevalence of bacterial strains that are resistant to the most commonly used antimicrobials, particularly clarithromycin. An effective (i.e., > 90%) first-line therapy is mandatory for avoiding supplementary treatments and testing, and more importantly for preventing the development of secondary resistance. This study reviews the recent literature on first-line therapies for @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ strain JNQH491 was recovered from a blood culture of a 48-year male patient at the department of oncology, who had received chemotherapy due to @di$ nasopharyngeal carcinoma @/di$ in the same hospital as JNQH473.	0
@gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$ is the predominant cause of @di$ Legionnaires' disease @/di$ (@di$ LD @/di$) in New Zealand. Although serogroup 2 (sg2) does not contain the most clinically significant strain, it is an important cause of disease. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of an sg2 isolate from a patient who was hospitalized with @di$ LD @/di$.	1
@gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$, an intracellular pathogen that coevolved with protozoan hosts, encodes a large arsenal of secreted effectors conferring the ability to evade host cellular defenses and to manipulate them to promote invasion and intracellular replication. Conservation of many signaling pathways of protozoa in human macrophages confers the ability of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ to infect humans, causing a severe @di$ pneumonia @/di$ called legionnaires' disease. Most of the secreted proteins are delivered by the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system and several of these have been shown to act on different cellular pathways critical for infection. Moreover, multiple effectors target a single host function to orchestrate bacterial survival. In this review, we focus on those effectors in the repertoire of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ proteins that target key cellular pathways by specific post-translational modifications.	1
@gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ has not been studied frequently, but one study revealed that it can modulate IgE production in a mouse model with an ovalbumin-induced allergy. This result matches our observation that lactic acid bacteria were significantly higher in the urine of healthy controls than those of @di$ AD @/di$ patients and showed protective effects both in vitro and in vivo. @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ has not been studied previously as a part of human microbiome in allergic diseases and our study is the first report of @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ in @di$ AD @/di$ patients. Furthermore, we showed that not only bacteria itself, but also EVs from lactic acid bacteria might have the beneficial effects for @di$ AD @/di$.	2
@gm$ M. intestinalis @/gm$). Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with abscesses in the brain and muscles. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis, and @di$ peri-implantitis @/di$.	1
@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, @di$ malnutrition @/di$ and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
@gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$ was isolated from the blood of four immunosuppressed patients over a period of 10 weeks. Three patients had intravascular catheters in situ and the other had a biliary stent. All presented with recurrent @di$ fever @/di$ despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures using standard bacteriological medium yielded a gram-positive bacillus from each patient. Ziehl-Neelsen staining of these cultures demonstrated a branching acid-fast bacillus that was subsequently identified as @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$ in each case. The isolates were sensitive to clarithromycin and, although success of treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy has been variable, this antibiotic combined with removal of the intravascular catheters was used to treat those three patients. The treatment was successful with no recurrence of symptoms after 12 months of follow-up. The patient with the biliary stent died soon after @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$ was isolated.	1
@gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (ORT) is an emerging respiratory pathogen of poultry in North America that is causing millions of dollars in economic losses to the poultry industry. @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ is associated with airsacculitis, @di$ pleuritis @/di$, pneumonia, and consolidation of lungs. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of infection. In this study, the mechanism of iron acquisition by @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ was explored. @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ strains grown under iron deprivation in media containing 200 microM 2,2'-dipyridyl did not secrete siderophores as measured by the chrome azurol S (CAS) agar and CAS solution assays. Filter disks impregnated with various protein-bound iron compounds and inorganic iron salts of Fe(III) and Fe(II) placed on iron-restricted agar inoculated with a lawn of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ supported growth from sheep and porcine hemoglobins, ovotransferrin, Fe(III), and Fe(II), but they did not support growth from bovine transferrin, bovine apo-transferrin, bovine lactoferrin, and hemin. However, both bovine hemoglobin and transferrin supported growth of O. rhinotracheale serotype C. Four immunoreactive proteins involved in iron acquisition were identified in an @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ membrane extract by using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ field strains showed differential sensitivity to 2,2'-dipyridyl. Of the 72 field strains tested, 22 strains were resistant to the iron chelator at concentrations of 50 microM and 100 microM, suggesting this attribute may be related to disease-producing potential of these strains. This is the first report on the identification of the iron acquisition mechanism of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$.	1
@gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ has been found to be associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans, including acute secretory gastroenteritis, invasive shigellosis-like diseases, and @di$ cholera-like diseases @/di$. Outbreaks are generally associated with seafood/fish consumption or contaminated water. Notably, it also has been reported to cause severe extraintestinal diseases, including bacteremia, peritonitis, pneumonia, meningitis, hepatobiliary disease, septicemia, and pseudoappendicitis. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ possesses cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity and can adhere to and invade host cells in vitro. Excluding ampicillin, this bacterium was found to be susceptible to a variety of antibiotics; however, multidrug-resistant traits have also been reported. Although clinical and epidemiological data already imply a role of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ in human infections, the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity and the molecular evolution of this bacterium have not yet been comprehensively investigated.	1
@gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ contains Gram-negative bacteria with a polar flagellum. Unlike the Bacillus genus, they do not form spores and effect the denitrification process (e.g., @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$). @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$, in the same way as E. coli, metabolise hexoses via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and obtain one molecule of ATP, NADH and NADPH as alternatives to the glycolysis pathway. Bacteria of this genus are mostly opportunistic pathogens, although we distinguish the absolute pathogens of animals and humans (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, and P. maltophila). Pseudomonas mallei and P. pseudomallei are the aetiological factors of @di$ glanders @/di$ and melioidosis. People are infected most often by inhalation and by direct contact through damaged skin causing soft tissue infections. @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ are usually involved in severe complications from burns and postoperative wound infections as well as respiratory tract infections.	1
@gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ was responsible for four cases of @di$ peritonitis @/di$ and one of wound infection at the catheter site in outpatients on chronic peritoneal dialysis.	1
@gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ is a Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, aerobic, encapsulated, non-motile rod, belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is commonly found in fish, water and soil. @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ was previously classified as a Klebsiella specie, but in 2001, the genus @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$ was created to include this germ along with Klebsiella planticola and Klebsiella terrigena. @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ and Raoultella planticola are recognized as histamine-producing bacteria that convert histidine to histamine, due to their pyridoxal phosphate-dependent histidine decarboxylase. Their presence in fish, especially in Scomberesocidae families, has been linked to histamine fish poisoning, also known as scombroid syndrome. It usually presents with @di$ flushing @/di$, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes oral swelling and respiratory compromise.	1
@gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ is a Gram-negative foodborne bacterium that is usually found in raw poultry and eggs. It can contaminate various foods, such as dairy, meat, raw vegetables, fruits, and animal feeds. Salmonella spp. are common and widely distributed foodborne pathogens in the European Union. In 2012, 91,034 Salmonella cases and 347 strong-evidence outbreaks related to Salmonella were reported. Possible sources of human infection with @gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ range from the consumption of beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products . @gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ causes nontyphoidal salmonellosis infections relative to human illness, such as acute gastroenteritis. @gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ infection can also cause severe illness involving diarrhea, chills, abdominal cramps, fever, head and body aches, @di$ nausea @/di$, and vomiting.	1
@gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ is a usually innocuous commensal on the skin of mice and other mammals. Prompted by reports on the involvement of PSMs in @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ (@di$ AD @/di$) and the isolation of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ from mice with @di$ AD @/di$-like symptoms, we here identified and characterized PSMs of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ with a focus on a potential involvement in @di$ AD @/di$ phenotypes. We found that most clinical @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ strains produce two PSMs, one of the shorter alpha- and one of the longer beta-type, which were responsible for almost the entire lytic and pro-inflammatory capacities of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$. Importantly, PSMalpha of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ caused lysis and degranulation of mast cells at degrees higher than that of S. aureus delta-toxin, the main PSM previously associated with @di$ AD @/di$. However, @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ did not produce significant @di$ AD @/di$ symptoms in wild-type mice as opposed to S. aureus, indicating that promotion of @di$ AD @/di$ by @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ likely requires a predisposed host. Our study indicates that non-specific cytolytic potency rather than specific interaction underlies PSM-mediated mast cell degranulation and suggest that the previously reported exceptional potency of delta-toxin of S. aureus is due to its high-level production. Furthermore, they suggest that species that produce cytolytic PSMs, such as @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$, all have the capacity to promote @di$ AD @/di$, but a high combined level of PSM cytolytic potency is required to cause @di$ AD @/di$ in a non-predisposed host.	1
@gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ is a commensal bacterium found on the skin and mucosal surfaces of SPF mice. @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ is rarely pathogenic, most often causing skin lesions and dermatitis in immunocompromised mice, particularly those with impaired NADPH oxidase function. Here we report spontaneous @di$ infection @/di$ with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ in Rag1-/-Tpl2-/- mice. @di$ Infection @/di$ was characterized by the presence of alopecia, crusts, and scaly skin. @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ was detected in the feces, skin, lymph nodes, and lungs of Rag1-/-Tpl2-/- mice and led to mortality or euthanasia due to humane endpoints. C57BL/6 mice were culture-positive for @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ on the skin, and Rag1-/- and Tpl2-/- mice were culture-positive on the skin and occasionally in the feces. However, @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ did not cause clinical symptoms in C57BL/6, Rag1-/-, or Tpl2-/- mice. Compared with those in Rag1-/- mice, relative concentrations of circulating monocytes, but not neutrophils or lymphocytes, were increased in Rag1-/-Tpl2-/- mice, consistent with their increased incidence of clinical symptoms. Overall, this case study suggests a novel role for Tpl2 in T-cell-independent host resistance to the otherwise commensal organism @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ (@gm$ S. mitis @/gm$), a viridans group streptococcus, is a normal microflora of the human oropharynx. For the majority of people, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ has a benign presence. However, it can cause a variety of infections ranging from @di$ dental caries @/di$ to bacterial infective endocarditis, bacteremia, meningitis, eye infections, and pneumonia.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is a major swine pathogen worldwide and is associated with meningitis, @di$ arthritis @/di$, endocarditis, septicemia, pneumonia and sudden death especially in young pigs. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is considered a zoonotic agent associated with human infections and has especially been described as the cause of meningitis in persons with occupational exposure to pigs. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is not an obligate pathogen and is commonly isolated from the respiratory tract of pigs.	1
@gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ is an estuarine bacterium, while it can cause severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$, wound infection, and otitis media in humans.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a human pathogen causing fatal septicemia with @di$ edematous @/di$ and hemorrhagic skin damage.	1
@gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ KIM6+ (pACYC177), DeltarovM mutant (pACYC177) and DeltarovM (pACrovM) strains used for flea infections were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth overnight twice in succession, first at 28 C and then at 37 C without aeration. Bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS and added to 5 ml of fresh heparinized mouse blood at a concentration of approximately 1X109 cells/mL. Xenopsylla cheopis fleas were then allowed to feed on the infected blood using a previously described artificial feeding chamber. Fleas that took a blood meal were maintained at 21 C and 75% relative humidity, fed twice weekly on uninfected mice and monitored for @di$ proventricular blockage @/di$ for 28 days as previously described.	1
@gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ is a gram-negative bacillus that thrives in conditions associated with iron overload. We describe an unusual case of a diabetic patient with a previously unrecognized hemochromatosis presenting with Y. enterocolitica septicemia. He was admitted because of a 10 day history of abdominal pain, @di$ fever @/di$ and jaundice. Blood cultures grew Y. enterocolitica. The abdomen CT scan showed multiple liver and splenic abscesses. Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin (2 months) resulted in a good clinical response. Serum iron studies showed iron overload. Liver biopsy revealed moderate fibrosis and early cirrhosis with large amounts of hemosiderin granules deposited in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium. This report reviews the literature and highlights that iron overload must be ruled out in @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ septicemia patients.	1
@gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ (@gm$ S. bovis biotype II/2 @/gm$) in 11 turkey flocks in Pennsylvania between 2010 and 2013. Affected poults were 2-3 wk of age. Major clinical observation was sudden increase in mortality among turkey poults without any premonitory clinical signs. Postmortem examination findings revealed acute septicemia with lesions such as fibrinous pericarditis, meningitis, splenic multifocal fibrinoid necrosis, @di$ hepatitis @/di$, osteochondritis, myositis, and airsacculitis.	1
@gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ (SGSP). The latter subspecies correspond to biotype II/2 (SGSP), which was the infectious agent in the present case. Streptococci of group D, including SGSP, can grow in bile esculin agar medium containing bile acids. Therefore, bacteria from the S. bovis group, including SGSP, can live in bile. Lee et al. evaluated 37 cases of S. bovis bacteremia and found that 14 (38%) had biliary tract disease, indicating that biliary tract infection was the main source of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ by S. bovis. Ruoff et al. reported that among 38 cases of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ by S. bovis, 9 cases (23.7%) of biotype II (II/1; 7 cases, II/2; 2 cases) had a hepatobiliary source of infection. Similarly, Corredoira et al. reviewed several cases of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ caused by S. bovis and S. salivarius and found that S. bovis-biotype-II-associated @di$ bacteremia @/di$ had a hepatobiliary origin in 50% of the patients.	1
A 38-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of extreme pain and a petechial rash on the left ankle for two weeks associated with generalized fatigue, intermittent fevers, and @di$ weight loss @/di$. He was discharged home from the ED on pain medications. He returned a few days later with a progressive rash that involved the entire left lower extremity to the level of the knee. He was diagnosed with herpes zoster (shingles) and was prescribed acyclovir and steroids. After several days, the patient presented for the third time to the ED. He developed a right lower extremity discomfort this time. The pain in bilateral lower extremities had become unbearable. His cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur at the apex and a faint diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Ultimately, he had an echocardiogram that demonstrated both a bicuspid aortic valve and large vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, and his blood culture grew @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ and Streptococcus oralis.	1
A 69-year-old female was referred from another hospital because of pleuritic chest pain with a large amount of @di$ pericardial effusion @/di$. She was diagnosed with acute pericarditis accompanied by cardiac tamponade. We performed emergency pericardiocentesis, with drainage of 360 ml of bloody pericardial fluid. The culture grew @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$, confirming the diagnosis of acute purulent pericarditis.	1
A case of @gm$ shigella @/gm$ @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ in an apparently healthy young man is presented. Pre-operative and intra-operative swabs taken from the septic focus grew @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$.	1
A clinical epidemiological survey of Legionella pneumophila infections occurring in Italy between 1 December 1985 and 31 May 1986 was carried out to evaluate the incidence of sporadic, epidemic and nosocomial @di$ L. pneumophila pneumonia @/di$. A total of 355 cases of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ were studied of which 11.5% were due to Gram positive bacteria, 11% were due to Gram negative bacteria, 7.9% were due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4.5% were due to @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ and 8.5% were due to sundry aetiological agents. The remainder (45.6%) could not be diagnosed accurately. In addition, the anti @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ antibody titres were assessed. The results are discussed in terms of the occurrence of the disease in Italy and regarding the importance of considering the possibility of legionellosic aetiology when diagnosing @di$ pneumonia @/di$.	1
A feature of @di$ obesity @/di$ appears to be an increase in the SCFA producer Roseburia which could provide more energy to the host. However, Roseburia are decreased relative to controls in type 2 diabetes and in animal models on high-fat diets. They are also reduced in IBD. As such, there exists not only differences but also similarities in dysbiosis of @di$ obesity @/di$ and IBD. In IBD, the microbial dysbiosis is more characteristic. Joosens et al. identified five characteristic bacterial changes in Crohn's disease. The pattern reported in CD included a decrease in Dialister invisus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, F. prausnitzii and a species of Clostridium cluster XIV (not further specified here) and increased R. gnavus. In UC, while F. prausnitzii is found to be decreased, there is also a reduction of @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$ which is different from the dysbiosis of CD where Roseburia (inulinivorans) is identified. A meta-analysis of the studies of dysbiosis in @di$ obesity @/di$ and IBD have found that bacterial signatures in IBD are more distinct than in @di$ obesity @/di$.	1
A nontuberculous @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$-like organism was identified as the causative agent of an epizootic of mycobacteriosis in a colony of African tropical clawed frogs, Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis, at the University of California, Berkeley. Diverse clinical signs of disease were observed, including lethargy, excess buoyancy, coelomic effusion, cutaneous ulcers, and granulomas. @di$ Visceral @/di$ granulomas, ulcerative and granulomatous dermatitis, coelomitis, and septicemia were common findings at necropsy. Identification of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$-like organisms was based on molecular and phenotypical characteristics. The findings of this investigation indicate that this @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$-like organism is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in aquatic anurans and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of coelomic effusion in amphibians. Furthermore, if this @gm$ Mycobacterium @/gm$ species ultimately is identified as @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$, X.	1
A previous report observed that @di$ eczema @/di$ severity correlated inversely with the abundance of Eubacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae in 6-month-old infants. High-risk infants who developed @di$ eczema @/di$ by 18 months likewise demonstrated delayed acquisition by Eubacterium and @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ species and correspondingly reduced butyrate and propionate levels at 26 weeks of age, compared to healthy controls. F. prausnitzii (Ruminococcaceae family) is a major component of the healthy human microbiome and is depleted in atopic children. The Korean COCOA birth cohort study showed that the stool of six-month-old infants with @di$ eczema @/di$ was depleted of R.	2
A previous study observed that celastrol from the roots of Tripterygium Wilfordii plant increased @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, suggesting that celastrol may promote the growth of @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$. In vivo analysis found that celastrol increased Bacteroidetes (phylum), Bacteroidaceae (family), and @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ (species) in the TAA-induced @di$ hepatic fibrosis @/di$ model (Fig. 6a-c, Supplementary Fig. 12a-e). Celastrol could also increase the level of @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ in healthy mice (Fig. 6d). In vitro analysis found that celastrol from 48.8 nM to 12.5 muM effectively promoted the growth of @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ (Fig. 6f). Quantitative and qualitative experiments revealed that celastrol promoted biofilm formation (Fig. 6g, h). Culture medium metabolomics profiling found that various gut microbiota metabolites were changed in @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ following celastrol treatment (Supplementary Fig. 12f, g), and the altered pathways included phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 12h). These results showed that celastrol could promote the growth of @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$.	1
A prospective cohort study involving 148 health care facilities in the United States reported 60% more central line-associated bloodstream infections, 43% more catheter-associated @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$ (@di$ UTIs @/di$), and 44% more cases of methicillin-resistant @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ bacteremia from March 2020 to December 2020 than would be expected based on predictions.	1
A rat model for @di$ acute otitis media @/di$ has been established and was used to delineate the temporal expression of messenger RNA for key inflammatory cytokines. Inoculation with live @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ induced a rapid expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (within 6 hours) followed by upregulation of message for interleukin (IL)-6 (peak at 12 to 24 hours, remaining elevated through 120 hours) and IL-10 (peak at 24 hours).	1
A recent study demonstrated that the butyrate-producer @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$ improves intestinal barrier function, counteracts endotoxemia and protect from atherosclerosis, indicating that SCFAs may prevent @di$ cardiovascular disease @/di$ progression through barrier protection.	2
A severe course of @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ was connected with a weakened immune response such as in cases of HIV, acute leukaemia, neutropenia during the course of a neoplastic disease and liver cirrhosis. There were descriptions of two cases of acute @di$ necrotic skin @/di$ and fascia inflammation that ended with the patients' death.	1
A shift from @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ to E. faecium during wastewater treatment was observed by Ferriera da Silva et al.. They suggested that this could be due to the higher intrinsic tolerance of E. faecium to environmental stress as compared to @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$. The BAF system includes polystyrene media carriers in addition to suspended solids, which increases the surface area available for biofilm formation. In contrast, the CAS system does not incorporate media carriers. Biofilm production in @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ spp. has been associated with pathogenicity, particularly with @di$ endocarditis @/di$.	1
A specific strain of the Gram-positive, butyric acid-producing bacterium, @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$, is a probiotic known to help mitigate symptoms of IBD. It possesses immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics. @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ is a fermentative bacterium that can degrade undigested dietary fiber, generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically butyrate. As such, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ has become an attractive candidate for the provision of beneficial effects on a host's gut homeostasis. Although many publications have revealed the protective effects of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ in mice with @di$ colitis @/di$, understanding the interactions of gut microorganisms and their metabolites with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ requires further investigation. Moreover, determining how @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ communicates with host cells and exerts influence over the gut microbial community needs to be investigated.	2
A study on 147 healthy individuals revealed a higher abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$-Prevotella-Porphyromonas in individuals who consumed more coffee than in those who consumed less coffee, which could be due to the polyphenols and caffeine in coffee beverages. In a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, partial effects on improving the gut dysbiosis and disrupted plasma SCFA profile were reported for caffeine and chlorogenic acids. A pilot trial revealed possible effects of caffeine and chlorogenic acids in rising Bifidobacterium in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver and @di$ diabetes @/di$, although the increases were not significant.	0
A total of 22,105 stools obtained from inpatients at our institution from 2001-2012 were analyzed retrospectively, and only two specimens (2/22,105, 0.009%) were positive for @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$. Both cases occurred in August. These two patients had clinical manifestations of gastroenteritis and underlying diseases: one had viral hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and the other had @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$.	0
AAD, HPP, Pouchitis), unlike species that are widely used across many different GI diseases, such as LGG, which is used in the prevention or treatment of @di$ TD @/di$, Pouchitis, CD, AAD, HPP, NEC, and IBS. LGG is used widely in clinical trials because of its beneficial effects on intestinal immunity. Furthermore, LGG has shown to inhibit the growth of Esherichia coli, Streptococci, C. difficile, Bacteriodes fragilis and Salmonella by producing an antimicrobial substance. S. boulardii, E. faecum, B. lactis, LGG, L. casei, and L. acidophilis combined with B. infantis also showed significant efficacy in the treatment and prevention of GI disease. Our results support recent findings by McFarland et al.. who showed that S. boulardii prevented AAD and by Orrhage et al.. who showed that the combination of @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium reduced the faecal counts of clostridia in CDD.	2
AHPND is one of the biggest disease threats to the shrimp aquaculture industry along with @di$ white spot disease @/di$ (@di$ WSD @/di$) which has severely impacted both crayfish and shrimp aquaculture. AHPND is caused by specific marine Vibrio spp. which carry plasmid-borne binary toxins PirAVp and PirBVp. This research investigated if crayfish are susceptible to AHPND-causing @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ (VpAHPND) to discern the potential risk that AHPND may pose to the crayfish aquaculture industry.	1
"According to, anomalies in the transcellular transport are another reason for intestinal permeability problems of chickens under @di$ HS @/di$. Indeed, a loss of epithelial integrity can degenerate into cell damage and consequent opening of TJ-independent pathways. Enteric bacteria can cross the altered and more permeable intestinal epithelium and, eventually, reach the liver or even migrate to other organs or tissues. For example, heat-stressed broilers showed a greater hepatic @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ invasion due to increased intestinal permeability. This event, commonly called ""bacterial translocation"", can be prelude to extraintestinal issues, such as deteriorations of liver functionality and health as well as bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO). @di$ HS @/di$ effects on the GI epithelium of chickens are summed up in Table 6."	1
Accordingly, LCD-fed mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, while a high-cellulose diet (HCD) was protective against @di$ colitis @/di$. Notably, HCD-fed mice showed expansion of symbiotic @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ and altered lipid metabolite profiles, although no significant changes in SCFA levels were apparent. We further observed that administration of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ reversed the crypt shortening, goblet cell depletion, and susceptibility to @di$ colitis @/di$ caused by LCD consumption.	2
Active immunization of guinea pigs and rabbits with outer membrane proteins (OMP) isolated from Shigella flexneri 3a and @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ phase I protected the animals against @di$ keratoconjunctivitis shigellosa @/di$ induced with the homologous or heterologous strain. Protection was also achieved in rabbits after passive immunization with anti-OMP immune serum. Active immunization with lipopolysaccharide of S. flexneri 3a did not protect rabbits against @di$ keratoconjunctivitis shigellosa @/di$.	1
Additionally, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ sensitization of yellow catfish often results in square-shaped hemorrhagic ulcers on the body surface and causes more than 90% mortality in 3-5 days, consistent with aseptic shock. This shock is a subset of sepsis characterized by @di$ hypotension @/di$ and significantly increased mortality risk. The cytokine storm observed in our study further indicates that @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ can elicit a severe immune response in the host, resulting in tissue damage and a high mortality rate.	1
Additionally, several studies demonstrated that the most prevalent species associated with blood infections were @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$, A. veronii, A. dhakensis, and A. hydrophila. The underlying diseases found in cases of bacteremia/septicemia were most commonly malignancy, hepatobiliary disease, and diabetes. Moreover, the most common symptoms associated with Aeromonas bacteremia according to Janda and Abbott included fever (74-89%), jaundice (57%), abdominal pain (16-45%), septic shock (40-45%), and @di$ dyspnea @/di$ (12-24%).	1
Aeromonas media, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Streptomyces hygroscopicus display increased ICI in both @di$ CD @/di$ and UC patients (Additional file 1: Figure S2C). Celeribacter indicus, Herbaspirillum hitneri, Hymenobacter swuensis, @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$, Lacimicrobium alkaliphilum, Moraxella ovis, Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, Spharochaeta globose, Terriglobus roseus, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi, Flavonifractor plautii, Sandaracinus amylolyticus, and Pandoraea pnomenusa in @di$ CD @/di$ (Additional file 1: Figure S3A).	0
After COS consumption, the abundance of Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, and Escherichia was reduced, while the abundance of Bacteroides, Megasphaera, Roseburia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium was increased (Figure 2(b)). Furthermore, COS consumption increased the probiotic species Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Phascolarctobacterium. Faecalibacterium was found to be linked with type 2 diabetes mellitus or other risk factors of heart disease. Conversely, Faecalibacterium numbers were also found to be decreased in the patients with chronic heart disease. Cardiac abnormalities were reported to be caused by bacterial @di$ myocarditis @/di$ resulting from E.	0
After the massive outbreak of infections with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) of serotype @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ in Germany in the summer of 2011, post-outbreak surveillance for further infections with this type of STEC was maintained until the end of 2011. This surveillance was based on national mandatory reporting of STEC infections and the associated complication of @di$ haemolytic uraemic syndrome @/di$ (@di$ HUS @/di$), as well as on data obtained from a questionnaire. Between the outbreak's end (5 July) and 31 December 2011, a total of 33 post-outbreak cases were recorded. Post-outbreak cases occurred with diminishing frequency towards the year's end and resembled the outbreak cases in many respects, however the proportion of @di$ HUS @/di$ among all post-outbreak cases was smaller than during the outbreak.	1
Again, the significant results were predominantly attributable to the difference between the early @di$ RA @/di$ and at-risk groups and the healthy control group, rather than to the difference between the early @di$ RA @/di$ group and the at-risk group (Supplementary Table 4). While @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ (zOTU 4) was more abundant in the early @di$ RA @/di$ group and the at-risk group (Figure 2D), Neisseria flavescens/subflava (zOTU 7) and Streptococcus dentisani/infantis/mitis/oralis/sp._oral_taxon_058 (zOTU 1) were more abundant in the healthy control group compared to the other 2 groups. Fusobacterium periodonticum (zOTU 13) was more abundant in the healthy control group compared to the early @di$ RA @/di$ group, while no differences were found in the at-risk group compared to both other groups.	1
Agathobaculum butyriciproducens is a strictly anaerobic and butyric acid-producing bacteria that has had impressive success in restoring cognition in @di$ Alzheimer's disease @/di$ mouse models. Anaerostipes hadrus can produce butyrate from carbohydrates or lactate and is often decreased in diabetes. Eubacterium rectale is also a butyrate producer responsible for metabolizing dietary plant polysaccharides; it is increased in obesity and reduces inflammatory dendritic cells. Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus is also a butyrate producer. Blautia obeum is a natural producer of bile salt hydrolases as well as lantibiotics that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria; it has previously been shown to be decreased in acute cerebral infarction. @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ is a butyrate producer that utilizes acetate and increases serotonin and melatonin and is reduced in ulcerative colitis and hypertension; treatment with Roseburia hominis in ulcerative colitis has been shown to strengthen gut barrier function and enhance T regulatory cells.	2
All children suffering from @di$ fever @/di$ for more than 5 days, without clinically evident cause for @di$ fever @/di$, with symptoms suggestive of brucellosis such as weight loss, weakness, anorexia and polyarthalgia were screened for brucellosis by a rapid slide serum agglutination test using plasmatic stained febrile antigens reagent code number FA/018 for @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ and FA/020 for B.	0
Already, specific probiotics such as Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$ are used to treat @di$ liver damage @/di$ by attenuating D-galactosamine.	2
Also, Eubacterium rectale was found less frequently in children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as @di$ autism @/di$. The second bacterium, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, which is a common member of the healthy human gut microbiome with known anti-inflammatory properties, showed similar depletion in the post-concussion group.	2
Also, while constraint-based methods such as FBA have considerable predictive capability, our approach only gave very limited information, and we decided not to restrict the in vivo screening to the data obtained from the computational approach and to include other representative well-described bacteria for which succinate-consumption ability has been demonstrated in vitro, such as @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ and D. hominis (not identified in the FBA analysis), or in vivo such as Clostridium butyricum. All strains were tested by oral gavage in db/db @di$ obese @/di$ mice on alternate days for 3 weeks. No significant differences in body weight or food consumption were observed for any of the strains tested (Fig. 3a, b), and only O. laneus administration showed a trend to lower body weight evolution (Fig. 3a). With the exception of @gm$ P. succinatutens @/gm$ and D.	0
Although cold storage retards the growth of microorganisms, many bacteria can grow and generate spoilage metabolites, which cause pollution of aquatic products called specific @di$ spoilage organisms @/di$ (@di$ SSOs @/di$) during storage. Shewanella spp. and @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. are well-known gram-negative bacteria and have been isolated from aquatic food during cold storage. These microorganisms were the main contributors of TVB-N, putrefactive flavor, trimethylamine, amines, and proteolysis in aquatic food. Hence, bacterial metabolism plays a key role in evaluating the quality of aquatic food. Many research on aquatic food quality during cold storage has mainly focused on the spoilage potential of Shewanella spp. (e.g.,), @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. (e.g.,), respectively. Many bacteria were raised during the early stage of cold storage, while Shewanella spp. and @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. tended to become the major SSO during the early stage of cold storage. Previous studies have shown that S. putrefaciens has been found to dominate the SSO of aquatic food, such as bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna stored at 4 C, which can produce high levels of alcohols, aldehydes, 1-octen-3-ol, esters, alkanes, nitrogen and sulfur, causing strong off-odors. Meanwhile, S. putrefaciens can form biofilms that cause the sticky surface of aquatic products and are capable of producing H2S. Therefore, the growth of S. putrefaciens as an aquatic food spoilage marker is necessary to limit the shelf life at low storage temperatures. In a previous study we demonstrated that @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ was isolated and identified as an SSO from bigeye tuna. We found that the TVB-N, TMA, and pH values to evaluate the spoilage potential of @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ increased as storage time increased. Moreover, some lipid contents changed dramatically by culturing @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$, which directly accelerated the quality deterioration of bigeye tuna by lipid metabolites.	1
Among 524 EHEC isolated from @di$ HUS @/di$ patients, 355 (67.7%) belonged to serotypes @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$/H- (249 were non-sorbitol-fermenting EHEC @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$/H- and 106 were sorbitol-fermenting EHEC O157:H-), and 169 (32.3%) belonged to 34 non-O157 serotypes. Because the phylogeny of @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$/ H- has been extensively studied and is well established, we focused on MLST analysis of the 169 non-O157 strains, which represent all non-O157 EHEC serotypes from German @di$ HUS @/di$ patients during the study period.	1
Among the 83 patients who received DBV, 4.8% experienced adverse effects: @di$ asthenia @/di$, self-limited rash, fever with self-limited shivering, and impaired renal function that was found by laboratory tests to have returned to its baseline status at one week. There was no grade 4 event or any event causing treatment discontinuation, and no patient developed colitis due to @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$.	0
Among them, Mycobacterium fortuitum, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M. abscessus are the common species which have been identified. Though they are occasionally implicated in pulmonary infections, NTM are very commonly associated with cutaneous infections, especially surgical site infections. Identification of NTM infection at such sites should be suspected when there is delayed healing of the wound. Histopathological Examination (HPE) of the wound site may reveal a classical picture of @di$ granulomas @/di$, epithelioid cells and giant cells which may lead to a suspicion of tuberculosis.	1
Among these significant correlations, age and FBG showed none correlation with glycan biosynthesis-related bacteria or orthologs, while @di$ TG @/di$ only positively correlated with one glycan-generating bacteria (B. vulgatus), and HDL only negatively correlated with the same bacteria, so these factors should have little influence on at least glycan-biosynthesis bacteria and functions of gut microbiome in HBP patients. Still, there was no body mass index (BMI) information in the HBP group, making us unable to analyze the correlation of BMI and the identified metagenomic changes. But according to meta-analysis on obesity adults' gut microbiota, the obesity adults had enriched @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum; while lean adults had higher abundance of Bacteroides faecichinchillae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium bolteae, and Flavonifractor plautii.	0
Amplification of aggR was sufficient for classification as EAEC and a positive amplification for ipaH identified EIEC/@gm$ Shigella @/gm$. EPEC positive samples were divided into typical EPEC (carrying both eae and bfpA) and atypical EPEC (the presence of eae only). The STEC pathotype was identified by the presence of stx1 and/or stx2, and the presence or absence of rfb_O157 was used to differentiate between STEC O157 and the non-O157 STEC serogroups. STEC that have the potential to cause @di$ HUS @/di$ carry additional virulence genes, specifically eae and aggR.	1
An alternative hypothesis for our findings is that a core microbiota including anaerobes such as @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Veillonella may be present in healthy airways with disruption of this microbiota leading to disease, as has been suggested by studies in asthma and @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$.	1
An example of this is the association of Bifidobacterium with species various strains of which are known to be linked with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$. A likely exception to this is the interaction between Bifidobacterium (a lactate producer) and @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$, a lactate-consuming butyrate producer.	0
Anthocyanins are bioactive molecules in the colon that maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiome and, in addition, they have similar mechanisms in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer and @di$ NDs @/di$. As mentioned above, the benefits of anthocyanins are mainly achieved through regulating the homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota and producing some metabolites (SCFAs, etc.). @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ is the main genus of human gut microbiota, and its abundance is closely related to the total number of gut microbiota. By observing the pregnant rats who ingested dietary anthocyanins, Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were recovered in their mothers, NF-kappaB signaling pathway was down-regulated, and genomic DNA and ZO-1 gene were significantly expressed in their offspring.	2
Antigenic cross-reactivity between Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TP) and nonpathogenic Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter (TR), Treponema refringens strain Noguchi (TN), and @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ (@gm$ TV @/gm$) was examined by the Western immunoblotting technique in pooled sera from five rabbits infected intratesticularly with T. pallidum. Sera were obtained before infection and on days 6, 12, 20, 30, 60, and 120 after infection. The pooled preinfection sera reacted with nine polypeptides of @gm$ TV @/gm$, nine of TS, and five of TR. The pooled sera did not show any clear-cut reactions with TP, but some individual rabbit sera did demonstrate visible reaction with three to five polypeptides of TP. Twelve days after infection, multiple serum antibodies reacting with polypeptides of all treponemes were detected. The number of antibodies reacting with polypeptides and the intensity of reaction increased with the duration of infection; for the nonpathogenic treponemes (@gm$ TV @/gm$, @di$ TS @/di$, TR) 21-26 polypeptides were identified on day 30, and by day 60 a total of 21 were detected for TP.	0
Apparently, most of the bacterial species enriched in healthy controls had highly positive correlations with the pathways enriched in healthy group, and negative correlations with the pathways enriched in @di$ HUA @/di$ group, while those pathways enriched in the @di$ HUA @/di$ group had the opposite correlation trend. In particular, pwy-6590 and TFERM-pwy pathways had the stronger correlation with most of the bacterial species that can produce butyric acid enriched in healthy controls such as Odoribacter splanchnicus, @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, Bacteroides uniformis, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3_1_46FAA, Ruminococcus callidus, and Butyricimonas synergistica.	2
Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has been studied as a potential anti-cancer agent in clinical trials for the treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and @di$ melanomas @/di$. The arcA gene encoding ADI was cloned from a recently isolated strain Pseudomonas plecoglossicida CGMCC2039. The nucleotide sequence of ADI comprises an ORF of 1,254 bp encoding 417 amino acids. The deduced ADI protein sequence has a calculated molecular weight of 46.5 kDa and shows 97% and 85% identity to ADIs from @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ and P.	2
Around 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis are characterized as severe and develop complications, including @di$ necrotizing pancreatitis @/di$. Enterococci are the most commonly isolated species in @di$ infected pancreatic necrosis @/di$, followed by Escherichia Coli, with anaerobic bacteria being more rarely involved. We present a rare case of @di$ acute necrotizing pancreatitis @/di$ infected with @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species in a young patient.	1
As shown by a randomized controlled trial in obese and @di$ overweight @/di$ subjects, adherence to Mediterranean diet had beneficial metabolic effects (i.e., decreased plasma cholesterol and circulating levels of saturated fatty acids, increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, decreased insulin resistance) and changed microbiome. Treated subjects showed increased levels of fiber degrading Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, and decreased levels of the potentially proinflammatory Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus torques. Increased levels of genes for microbial carbohydrate degradation linked to butyrate metabolism were also noticed. Of note, the beneficial effects of Mediterranean dietary habits seem independent by caloric intake. Beneficial effects on gut microbiota have been also reported following intermittent fasting, a dietary regimen linked with weight loss and beneficial metabolic effects (i.e., improved glycemic control), increased bacterial alpha diversity, increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and decreased pathogenic bacteria. During Ramadan (a popular example of intermittent fasting), increased proportion of A. muciniphila, F. prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ have been reported.	2
Aspartate, a carbon source for a number of anaerobic bacteria, was included in our statistical models for identification of women at higher risk of @di$ preterm birth @/di$. The involvement of aspartate appears complex, since : while being positively correlated with OTU_6 (L. acidophilus), which our data suggest is protective against sPTB34 : it is also positively correlated with 2 other OTUs, OTU_21 (B. breve) and OTU_27 (@gm$ L. delbrueckii @/gm$), which were frequently associated with sPTB in our analysis.	1
Asymptomatic @di$ bacteriuria @/di$ was confirmed by a colony count range of >=100,000 CFU/mL on the initial urine culture. In this study, 73 (10.2%) of the 715 pregnant women had asymptomatic @di$ bacteriuria @/di$. Of the 73 pregnant women, the samples of 71 (97.3%) yielded single bacterial isolates while those of 2 (2.7%) yielded mixed bacterial isolates, giving a total of 75 isolates. Overall, the mixed bacterial isolates were found in the urine of two pregnant women in their third trimester (Table 1). Among the urine isolates, 21 (28%) were Gram positive and 54 (72%) were Gram negative. Escherichia coli was found to be the most common isolate (26.7%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%), Streptococcus agalactiae (9.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4%), Alcaligenes faecalis (2.7%), @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$ (2.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (2.7%), and others (Figure 1).	1
At present, probiotics are used in the clinics in the treatment and prevention of @di$ inflammatory bowel diseases @/di$, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis and Helicobacter pylori infection. Gut hosts about 30 species of Bifidobacteria, 52 species of Lactobacillus and others such as Saccharomyces, Streptococcus and Enterococcus. Commonly used commercial probiotics include species of Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus.	2
At species level, after VLCKD and BS, Parabacteroides distasonis increased its abundance while @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ and Lactobacillus rogosae decreased. P. distasonis was presented in the common core microbiome after the interventions. Previous studies showed a negative correlation between P. distasonis obesity and metabolic syndrome. P. distasonis has been suggested to have metabolic benefits on decreasing weight gain, @di$ hyperglycemia @/di$ and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. P. distasonis alleviates metabolic dysfunctions via production of succinate and secondary bile acids. Also, after long-term consumption of the Mediterranean Diet its abundance has been shown to be increased. Few studies evaluate the possible association of @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ and Lactobacillus rogosae with obesity or weight loss, except for previous reports that have associated @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ with obesity.	0
At taxonomic level, 24 genera, three microbial families, one class, two orders and a phylum were significantly (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%) associated with @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ in the Rotterdam Study (Table 2, Source Data). We replicated these results in the HELIUS cohort for 12 genera, which were associated with @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ scores in the same direction (Table 2, Fig. 1). These include Sellimonas, Eggerthella, Ruminococcaceae (UCG002, UCG003, UCG005), Coprococcus3, Lachnoclostridium, Hungatella, LachnospiraceaeUCG001, Ruminococcusgauvreauiigroup, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ and Subdoligranulum. Of the three microbial families significantly associated with @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ in RS, only family Ruminococcaceae was significantly associated with @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ in the HELIUS cohort. The direction of association was consistent for all associated taxa across both cohorts and the meta-analysis of results from both cohorts improved association p-values (Table 2). Of the 12 significantly associated genera 10 belong to the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. All significantly associated genera belonging to the family Ruminococcaceae were depleted in those with higher @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ (Fig. 1). While most of the significantly associated genera within family Lachnospiraceae were increased in those reporting higher @di$ depressive symptoms @/di$ (Fig.	1
At the genus level, half-marathon running reduced the abundance of fecal Ezakiella, Romboutsia, and Actinobacillus, but increased the abundance of Coprococcus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$. Actinobacillus species are purportedly responsible for several distinct animal diseases, such as actinomycosis in cattle, potent septicemia in the neonatal foal, and human @di$ periodontal disease @/di$.	0
BACKGROUND: @gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ (@gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$) is a bacterium known to cause severe neonatal infections in premature infants with the consumption of contaminated powdered milk formula. Adult infections are rare, and there have been no reports of pyosalpinx due to @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of left pyosalpinx due to @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ in a sexually inactive postmenopausal woman. A 70-year-old woman presented to our hospital with left lower @di$ abdominal pain @/di$ and fever. Abdominal computed tomography disclosed a cystic mass continuous with the left edge of the uterus. Urgent laparotomy revealed a ruptured left pyosalpinx with pus-like content. Left salpingo-oophorectomy, resection of the right tube, and washing of the abdominal cavity with saline were performed. Pathological examination of the left adnexa showed tubal tissue with acute inflammation and inflammatory exudate, which were compatible with pyosalpinx, and pus culture yielded @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report of pyosalpinx due to @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$. Cronobacter sakazakii infections in adult women might occur in the elderly, whose immunity has weakened. Further accumulation of cases of C. sakazakii infection is needed to clarify the etiology and behavior of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ in adults.	1
BACKGROUND: Although immunotherapy works well in @di$ glioblastoma @/di$ (@di$ GBM @/di$) preclinical mouse models, the therapy has not demonstrated efficacy in humans. To address this anomaly, we developed a novel humanized microbiome (HuM) model to study the response to immunotherapy in a preclinical mouse model of @di$ GBM @/di$. METHODS: We used 5 healthy human donors for fecal transplantation of gnotobiotic mice. After the transplanted microbiomes stabilized, the mice were bred to generate 5 independent humanized mouse lines (HuM1-HuM5). RESULTS: Analysis of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data from fecal samples revealed a unique microbiome with significant differences in diversity and microbial composition among HuM1-HuM5 lines. All HuM mouse lines were susceptible to @di$ GBM @/di$ transplantation, and exhibited similar median survival ranging from 19 to 26 days. Interestingly, we found that HuM lines responded differently to the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. Specifically, we demonstrate that HuM1, HuM4, and HuM5 mice are nonresponders to anti-PD-1, while HuM2 and HuM3 mice are responsive to anti-PD-1 and displayed significantly increased survival compared to isotype controls. Bray-Curtis cluster analysis of the 5 HuM gut microbial communities revealed that responders HuM2 and HuM3 were closely related, and detailed taxonomic comparison analysis revealed that @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ was commonly found in HuM2 and HuM3 with high abundances. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study establish the utility of humanized microbiome mice as avatars to delineate features of the host interaction with gut microbial communities needed for effective immunotherapy against @di$ GBM @/di$.	2
BACKGROUND: Non-typloid @gm$ salmonella @/gm$ can cause septicemia and extradigestive disorders in immunodepressed adults. These frequent diseases can be life-threatening. CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old woman was treated with corticosteroid therapy for 1 year for suppurated thrombophlebitis of the right greater saphenous vein. @di$ Weight loss @/di$, fever at 41 degrees C and Salmonella enterididis isolated from blood cultures and skin samples led to the diagnosis of septicemia with multiple septic foyers including the venous endothelium and surrounding soft tissue. DISCUSSION: In Western countries, there has been an uprise in the frequency of low-grade salmonella infections by food poisoning usually causing acute diarrhea. S. enterididis can also cause severe infectious syndromes with multiple septic localizations, main in patients with a compromised immune reaction. In our cases, @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ septecemia was revealed by an unusual situation.	1
BACKGROUND: Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a rare genetic disease, in which high urinary oxalate (Uox) cause recurrent kidney stones and/or progressive nephrocalcinosis, often followed by early end-stage renal disease, as well as extremely high plasma oxalate, @di$ systemic oxalosis @/di$ and premature death. @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$, an anaerobic oxalate degrading bacterium, naturally colonizes the colon of most humans. Orally administered @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ (Oxabact) was found to significantly reduce urine and plasma oxalate.	2
BACKGROUND: We evaluated the burden of Shigella spp from children aged 0-59 months with medically attended moderate-to-severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and matched controls at sites in Mali, The Gambia, and Kenya participating in the Vaccine Impact on @di$ Diarrhea @/di$ in Africa (VIDA) study from 2015 to 2018. METHODS: Shigella spp were identified using coprocultures and serotyping in addition to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Episode-specific attributable fractions (AFe) for Shigella were calculated using Shigella DNA quantity; cases with AFe >=0.5 were considered to have shigellosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of Shigella was determined to be 359 of 4840 (7.4%) cases and 83 of 6213 (1.3%) controls by culture, and 1641 of 4836 (33.9%) cases and 1084 of 4846 (22.4%) controls by qPCR (cycle threshold <35); shigellosis was higher in The Gambia (30.8%) than in Mali (9.3%) and Kenya (18.7%). @di$ Bloody diarrhea @/di$ attributed to Shigella was more common in 24- to 59-month-old children (50.1%) than 0- to 11-month-old infants (39.5%). The Shigella flexneri serogroup predominated among cases (67.6% of isolates), followed by Shigella sonnei (18.2%), @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$ (11.8%), and Shigella dysenteriae (2.3%).	1
Bacterial strains isolated from meat are both pathogenic and commensal such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$, Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp. and etc.. Acinetobacter species are saprophytic, ubiquitous and have emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen due to its ability for survival in the hospital environment on a wide range of dry and moist surfaces. Human infections caused by Acinetobacter species include pneumonia, which is most often related to endotracheal tubes or tracheostomies, @di$ endocarditis @/di$, meningitis, skin and wound infections, peritonitis in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, UTI and bacteremia.	0
Bacterial translocation is an important mechanism of @di$ AP infection @/di$. A previous study showed that the predominant aerobic bacteria included E. coli, K. pneumoniae, streptococcus group D, and S. aureus, while the predominant anaerobic bacteria included Peptostreptococcus species, B. fragilis group organisms, Clostridium species, Prevotella species, Veillonella species, and Fusobacterium species. In the current study, the results showed that the predominant aerobic bacteria were K. pneumoniae complex, A. baumannii, E. faecium, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, while the predominant anaerobic bacteria were B. fragilis, B. kribbi, @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$, D. invisus, and O. uli. The main pathogens responsible for @di$ CAP @/di$ and SAP have changed somewhat as compared to those reported in previous studies. This might be related to the severity or antibiotic use in the last two decades. Approximately 42% of aerobic bacteria and 43% of anaerobic bacteria might be derived from the gut, which was different from the bacterial communities present in blood-related infections. Moreover, the current study also indicated that the source of a considerable proportion of bacteria was oral and airway microbiota as well as from the environment, which was similar to the results of the pancreas-related microbial communities. This might due to the collection of samples from the SAP and @di$ CAP @/di$ patients, who were affected by long-term hospitalization, such as antibiotics, surgery, etc., and were immunocompromised, resulting in infections from various sources.	1
Because the genus @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ has been characterized by producing propionate, and this genus was decreased in the METH @di$ CPP @/di$ group, we proposed that propionate was also attenuated by METH administration. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the relative concentration of propionate in the fecal matter of the two groups by GC-MS. The data showed that the relative concentration of propionate in the control group was more than twice that in the METH @di$ CPP @/di$ group.	1
Bifidobacteria in the intestine can significantly enhance transcription of the lactase gene promoter and promote lactose absorption, thus reducing @di$ hypocalcemia @/di$-induced bone mobilization. @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ fermentation further promotes the release of free calcium and accelerates calcium deposition.	2
Bifidobacterium species other than @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$, which causes dental caries and related diseases, rarely cause invasive human infections. Several cases of human infections caused by Bifidobacterium species, such as bacteremia, @di$ meningitis @/di$, peritonsillar abscess, pulmonary infection, peritonitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, epidural abscess, urinary tract infection, and shunt infection have been reported.	1
Botulinum toxin, one of the most poisonous biological substances known, is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$. @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ elaborates eight antigenically distinguishable exotoxins (A, B, C(1), C(2), D, E, F and G). All serotypes interfere with neural transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle paralysis. The weakness induced by injection with botulinum toxin A usually lasts about three months. Botulinum toxins now play a very significant role in the management of a wide variety of medical conditions, especially strabismus and focal @di$ dystonias @/di$, hemifacial spasm, and various spastic movement disorders, headaches, hypersalivation, hyperhidrosis, and some chronic conditions that respond only partially to medical treatment.	1
Brain abscesses are frequently caused by the continuous spread of concomitant infection areas (e.g., the middle ears, mastoids, and sinuses), and the most common clinical manifestations are @di$ headache @/di$ and fever, which can cause shock in severe cases. The most frequent sources of infection in brain abscesses are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. In recent years, some studies have demonstrated other sources of infection, including anaerobes, Gram-negative bacilli, oral @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$, associated Actinobacillus, bacillus, clostridium, and fungi.	1
Briefly, GEMS was a prospective case-control study of moderate-to-severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (MSD) in children under 5 years of age conducted between 1 December 2007 and 3 March 2011 in seven low- and middle-income countries: The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Cases with acute @di$ diarrhea @/di$ were included, each representing a new episode and meeting at least one criterion of MSD (sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, initiation of intravenous rehydration, dysentery, or hospitalization with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ or dysentery). Controls had no @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in 7 days and were included in the same demographic surveillance system area with cases and matched cases in age, sex, residence, and time. Illness management strategies, including feeding, fluid administration, and breastfeeding practices (no breastfeeding, partly breastfeeding, and exclusively breastfeeding), were queried from the caretakers. A follow-up study called GEMS1a also enrolled children with MSD as well as children with less-severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (LSD) (acute @di$ diarrhea @/di$ without signs of MSD) and matched controls from 31 October 2011 to 14 November 2012, using essentially the same methodology as the one for GEMS. To study the spread of Campylobacter and the effect of breastfeeding on campylobacteriosis, we included DNA samples isolated from stools of cases (both MSD and LSD) and controls under 1 year of age, whose caretakers indicated that they were exclusively breastfed or not breastfed (infants who were still breastfed but also received complementary food were excluded from the analysis), with Campylobacter isolated from the fecal samples using selective Campy-BAP plates for cephalothin-resistant Campylobacter species, including most C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ strains, grown at 42 C for 3 days.	1
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the case of a 90-year-old @di$ heart failure @/di$ (@di$ HF @/di$) patient who was admitted to the hospital for an acute state of @di$ cardiac decompensation @/di$. Twenty days after admission, he was febrile to 38.2  C whereas his white blood count and C-reactive protein increased to 6190 cells/muL and 31.2 mg/L, respectively. Of the patient's blood culture (BC) bottle pairs collected under the suspicion of infection, the anaerobic bottle yielded an organism that was later identified as @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$. Concomitantly, the patient's fecal sample was obtained for the intestinal microbiota characterization by sequencing the V3/V4/V6 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The analysis revealed highest relative abundances of Bacteroidales (34.1%), Prevotellaceae (19.0%), Prevotella (15.2%), and @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ (6.1%) taxa, indicating that the patient's gut microbiota was dominated by Prevotella organisms. The patient was successfully treated with metronidazole, and was discharged to a long-term care facility at 35 days of admission. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence for a clinically significant BSI caused by @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ and its relationship to a Prevotella-rich gut microbiota in the @di$ HF @/di$ patient setting. When strengthening the pathogenicity of @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, the present case suggests that the gut may be a source of BSI caused by the rare anaerobic organism.	1
CSF abnormalities were @di$ pleocytosis @/di$ (8 cases, 100%), elevated protein level (8 cases, 100%), and hypoglycorrhachia (5 cases, 62.5%). The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), and S. epidermidis and @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ (1); one patient had a negative CSF culture.	1
Case summary: We describe a case of @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ bicuspid aortic and mitral valve endocarditis with concurrent spontaneous mycotic aneurysm rupture and acute subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). A 40-year-old man with history of intravenous drug abuse presented to our emergency department with altered mental status and dyspnoea. Echocardiography documented large vegetations on a bicuspid aortic valve and on the mitral valve, causing acute severe aortic and mitral regurgitation. Brain computed tomography imaging documented a ruptured fusiform aneurysm in a distal branch of the right middle cerebral artery causing acute SAH and acute obstructive hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain was emergently placed and endovascular embolization of the aneurysm was achieved with deployment of six coils. Blood cultures grew @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ and antibiotic therapy according to microbiological sensitivities was administered. Hospital stay was complicated by acute heart failure, ST-elevation @di$ myocardial infarction @/di$, conduction disturbances, cerebral vasospasm, recurrent mycotic aneurysm rupture, and death.	1
Chronic @di$ lung colonization @/di$ with @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ was defined according to the modified Leeds criteria, i.e.	1
Clinical studies have shown that compared with premenopausal women, the ratio of @gm$ M. intestinalis @/gm$/Bacteroides (F/B) in postmenopausal women increases, and higher F/B is related to @di$ obesity @/di$.	1
Cluster differentiation by k-mer distance estimation revealed two distinct clusters when analysing MC @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates (Fig. 1). Faecal isolates divided equally into cluster 1 and 2 (n = 10 in each cluster), which was significantly different from biopsy isolates that were predominated by cluster 2 isolates (n = 49) (cluster 1, n = 11), p = 0.009. No differences were observed, when analysing isolates regarding MC subtypes: @di$ CC @/di$ isolates (cluster 1 n = 17, cluster 2 n = 38), LC isolates (cluster 1 n = 4, cluster 2 n = 21), p = 0.18.	0
Cohousing Lcn2-/- and Il-10-/- mice exacerbated @di$ colitis @/di$ in the latter. Consistently, Moschen et al reported that Lcn2-/-/Il-10-/- mice developed spontaneous @di$ colitis @/di$ and invasive right-sided tumors due to dysregulated microbiota. In particular, LCN2 inhibits growth of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ spp., which are associated with human CRC. @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ colonization induces CAC development via activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in Il-10-/- mice.	1
Comparative analyses among different cohorts including AS, rheumatoid arthritis and Behcet's disease were performed to uncover some common signatures related to @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$. Molecular mimicry of a microbial peptide was also demonstrated by ELISpot assay. RESULTS: We identified AS-enriched species including Bacteroides coprophilus, Parabacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium siraeum, @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ and Prevotella copri. Pathway analysis revealed increased oxidative phosphorylation, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation in AS gut microbiota. Microbial signatures of AS gut selected by random forest model showed high distinguishing accuracy. Some common signatures related to autoimmunity, such as Bacteroides fragilis and type III secretion system (T3SS), were also found. Finally, in vitro experiments demonstrated an increased amount of IFN-gamma producing cells triggered by a bacterial peptide of AS-enriched species, mimicking type II collagen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively indicate that gut microbiota was perturbed in untreated AS patients with diagnostic potential, and some AS-enriched species might be triggers of autoimmunity by molecular mimicry. Additionally, different @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$ shared some common microbial signatures.	1
Compared with the NC diet, LPF treatment significantly enriched SCFA-producing bacteria such as @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Selenomonas, Dialister, Acidaminococcus, Ruminococcus, and Bifidobacterium. Some of those bacteria also have other beneficial functions, for example, @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ could enhance large intestine functions and effectively prevent hyper-lactate accumulation-related diarrhea, Roseburia has benefits from immune modulation to @di$ inflammatory @/di$ regulation, Blautia and Faecalibacterium had anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ functions to help support gut health.	2
Comparing our results of the metagenomic sequencing with 16S rRNA sequencing on a genus level showed that there was an increased abundance of Dorea and a decreased abundance of @gm$ Butyrivibrio @/gm$. Dorea and @gm$ Butyrivibrio @/gm$ contain bacteria species that are known to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as proprionate, acetate and butyrate. SCFAs play an important role in the gut homeostasis and are thought to reduce the inflammatory properties of immune cells. In Parkinson's disease, several studies showed that there is a lower abundance of these SCFAs, which are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology. Dorea are acetate- and proprionate-producing bacteria, while @gm$ Butyrivibrio @/gm$ are known to produce butyrate. In @di$ dystonia @/di$, there might be a shift from butyrate-producing bacteria (such as @gm$ Butyrivibrio @/gm$) towards proprionate-producing bacteria (such as Dorea). Although we did not directly measure the SCFAs, this hypothesis is supported by the higher abundance of the metabolic pathway of proprionate production in DRD patients. Future studies examining SCFAs in @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients might further shed light on their role in the pathophysiology of @di$ dystonia @/di$.	2
Consistent with the known @di$ ASF @/di$ bacterial species, the majority of mapped transcripts derived from Bacteroidetes or Clostridia (Figure 1). Interestingly, many of the Bacteroidetes transcripts derive from the Porphyromonadaceae which includes the @di$ ASF @/di$ species @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$. Furthermore, the phylogenetic distribution of the reads differed significantly from that of the entire set of bacterial proteins in protein-nr, which is dominated by Proteobacteria. Comparisons to the taxonomic distribution of the samples using the previously filtered small- and large-subunit rRNA reads revealed that, while the same three dominant taxa were observed in ORF and rRNA datasets, their relative representation in the datasets differed. For example, the representation of 'Bacteroidetes/Others' within the transcript dataset ranged from ~5-28% in the mRNA dataset compared with ~50-73% in the rRNA dataset. Although it is possible that this may reflect differences in relative activities between these taxa, these differences may also be a consequence of the relative paucity of mRNA sequence data that has previously been generated for this taxon. Alternatively as noted above, this discrepancy may also be driven at least in part by biases in the rRNA-depletion protocol. Finally, as noted above, inaccuracies in rRNA classifications may skew the comparisons of mRNA- and rRNA-based taxonomic distributions. For example, the mapped transcript dataset also contained sequences of actinobacterial or proteobacterial origin even though these were not represented within the @di$ ASF @/di$ bacteria resident in the NOD mouse intestinal samples.	1
Contrary to our overall findings, DiGiulio and colleagues found a strong association between the non-@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$-dominated CST IV and @di$ preterm birth @/di$ in a case-control study based on the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Pregnant women (preterm n = 34, term n = 15), mostly of white ethnicity, were sampled weekly throughout gestation. Interestingly, the authors pointed out that if samples had been collected less frequently, short-term 'excursions' to CST IV would have been missed and probably the association between CST IV and @di$ preterm birth @/di$ would have been less obvious. The detection of a temporary microbiota disturbance represented by a change from a @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$-dominated CST to CST IV may have been missed in our study since samples were not collected longitudinally. Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that PTB-microbiota associations are population-dependent; lower @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and higher Gardnerella abundances were associated with PTB in a low-risk predominantly Caucasian cohort, but not in a high-risk predominantly African American cohort.	1
Core Tip: @di$ Haematogenous osteomyelitis @/di$ is an extremely rare disease in adults. Even rarer are pathological fractures that occur as a result. We present a clinical case in which a 46-year-old patient developed @di$ haematogenous osteomyelitis @/di$ after pneumonia. Both femurs were damaged, but the right one was preserved thanks to the preventive built-in AO external fixation. The left thigh was amputated and the signs of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ did not recur. The pathogen that caused this insidious disease, @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, has not been reported in the literature as a cause of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$. Moreover, there are no reported cases of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ affecting both femurs at once.	1
Correlation analysis using mWGS data showed that @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$ (r=0 49, FDR=0 046), Coprococcus comes (r=0 62, FDR=0 016), Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens (r=0 63, FDR=0 016), Sutterella wadsworthensis (r=0 56, FDR=0 025) were positively correlated with the EDSS. Notably, @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and is associated with increased gut permeability. Sutterella, a Gram-negative genus from Proteobacteria, has been associated with various diseases including @di$ autism @/di$ and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).	1
Depletion of Akkermansia muciniphila has also been associated with mass translocation of endotoxin-activated CCR2+ monocytes, leading to @di$ pancreatic injury @/di$ and type 1 diabetes (T1D). The examples of Akkermansia and @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ may reflect an intricate symbiont homeostasis driven by diet.	0
Desulfovibrio increased in the intestinal tracts of mice with @di$ impaired glucose tolerance @/di$, especially in mice fed a high-calorie diet. @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$ is the main community of Firmicutes. Most of the bacteria in this group can help the host absorb energy from the diet, increasing the occurrence of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are also associated with circulating insulin and glucose levels. A study in humans found that the abundance of @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$ in feces samples negatively correlated with insulin levels. A higher abundance of @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$ causes lower insulin levels, which may lead to higher FBG and therefore increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.	2
Dexamethasone was associated with lower mortality in patients with definite @di$ meningitis @/di$ (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.96), short duration of symptoms (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-1.00), @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ @di$ meningitis @/di$ (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.78), patients in countries with high (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.87) and medium Human Development Index (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.00).	1
Different studies have reported beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet, and diets rich in fibers and whole grains promote the growth of beneficial gut microbes associated with short-chain fatty acid production from carbohydrates including @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, or different Bifidobacterium lineages. In contrast, these same lineages are depleted in diets generally lacking these bacterial substrates, including a gluten-free diet and protein-rich diets with low fiber content. Within these diets, there is also an impact of the source of dietary protein (animal, vegetal) on microbiome and metabolome profiles. In our current cohort, we evaluated the compositional changes that are observed after 10% @di$ weight loss @/di$. The calorie-restricted, high-protein low carbohydrate diet in the current study was previously shown to improve subjects' metabolic conditions and to limit weight regain in a population from the European DIOGENES consortium. We further confirmed here that the subjects' metabolic traits were improved, in addition to significant @di$ weight losses @/di$.	2
"During 1877-1878 the ""great swine plague"" (i.e., @di$ classical swine fever @/di$) moved through the United States, England and Scandinavian countries before entering and spreading through mainland Europe. Losses associated with these epidemics likely prompted early bacteriologists to investigate swine diseases. In 1876, Robert Koch successfully isolated a bacterium from a mouse inoculated with putrefying blood. Koch initially designated the bacterium ""Bacillus of mouse septicemia"". Since Koch's discovery, the bacterium changed its name a total of 36 times; @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ was officially designated as its scientific name only in 1966 and has been in use ever since (Figure 1). This specific name was created from the Greek words ""erysipelas"" (rose, red skin), ""trix"" (hair), ""rhusius"" (reddening), and ""pathus"" (disease). During a swine erysipelas outbreak in southern France from 1882-1883 Louis Thuillier successfully isolated the bacterium from pigs with ""rouget"" as erysipelas is called in France. At approximately the same time Friedrich Loffler also isolated the bacterium but only published his findings after completing the first accurate description of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ and reproducing erysipelas in experimentally infected pigs in 1886 (Figure 1)."	1
EBSI was defined by _1 positive blood culture for @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$ or faecalis and fever, @di$ hypotension @/di$, or chills.	1
Eculizumab has been shown to be an effective drug in treatment of complement-mediated @di$ HUS @/di$ (aHUS). There have been case series which have demonstrated the benefit of using eculizumab in children with STEC-HUS and CNS involvement. On the contrary, other studies reported that there was no benefit seen with use of eculizumab in addition to standard medical care in patients (both adults and children) affected in the 2011 outbreak of @gm$ E. Coli O104:H4 @/gm$.	1
Effective ocular hygiene will not only reduce microbial colonisation in the skin and lid margin but also prevent spreading microbes to the ocular surface causing conjunctivitis, @di$ keratitis @/di$ and even sight-threatening endophthalmitis. In this regard, the foam formulation of 2% T4O can be an effective and viable option to achieve this objective as it demonstrated cidal activity against all microorganisms listed in USP <51> at both 14 and 28 days and exerted a rapid killing effect within 60 s against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative ocular isolates, such as @gm$ A. baumanii @/gm$ that causes endophthalmitis infection, Moraxella that causes conjunctivitis and @di$ keratitis @/di$, and Propionibacterium acne that causes chronic blepharitis, endophthalmitis, Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and dry eye.	1
Efficacy of OMN6 intravenous treatment on survival in a lethal mouse @di$ bacteremia @/di$ model using an MDR @gm$ AB strain @/gm$. The survival study was performed at Omnix Medical with neutropenic CD-1 female mice (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), weighing 21-25 g. The bacterial inoculum was prepared by suspending a few colonies of MDR @gm$ AB @/gm$ ATCC BAA-1793 (OMN6 MIC = 8 microg/mL) in 5 mL of Difco Nutrient Broth (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), which was incubated with shaking for 2 h at 37  C.	1
Eggerthella sinensis, Colinsella aerofaciens, Faecalibacterium prasunitzii, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, and Lactonifactor longoviformis decreased in patients with bladder pain syndrome. In addition, a large cohort study proved that the abundance of Streptococcus species was linked to the increase in @di$ knee joint pain @/di$.	0
Eight patients had intra-abdominal infections, 3 had @di$ pneumonia @/di$, and 4 had bacteremia. The infections were diagnosed at a median of 5.9 months (range, 0.8-49.8 mo) after transplantation. Eight patients had coinfections, mainly with enteric pathogens. @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ was isolated in 13 cases and ESBL Klebsiella oxytoca and ESBL Escherichia coli were isolated in 1 case each.	1
Emerging data supports a link between the gut microbiota and @di$ obesity @/di$, suggesting that specific microbiomes could increase the capacity to harvest energy from the diet, leading to @di$ obesity @/di$. One study found that cohousing lean and @di$ obese @/di$ mice prevented the development of increased adiposity and body mass and showed that the microbiota's metabolic profile of @di$ obese @/di$ mice transformed to a lean-like state. We collected the fecal samples from 58 @di$ obese @/di$ patients who scheduled bariatric surgery and re-collected samples from 22 patients 6 months after bariatric surgery. We then evaluated changes in the gut microbiome before and after bariatric surgery. We observed increased alpha diversity and differed beta diversity after bariatric surgery as well as changes in specific microbiomes after bariatric surgery. Compared to previous studies that have described higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios in @di$ obese @/di$ patients versus their healthy counterparts at the phylum level. our study shows that the Blautia/Bacteroides ratio is associated positively with BMI at the genus level. In addition, we presented that Ruminococcus gnavus and @gm$ Blautia obeum @/gm$ wexlerae were enriched in patients before bariatric surgery, whereas Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides nordii, Bacteroides uniformis, and Bacteroides dorei vulgatus were enriched in patients after bariatric surgery. These results suggest that gut microbial changes occur after bariatric surgery and that specific microbiomes might be strongly associated with @di$ obesity @/di$.	1
Emerging uropathogens include the SBG, especially @gm$ Streptococcus gallolyticus, subspecies pasteurianus @/gm$, although species and subspecies could not be specified in all cases and these data are therefore not reported; however, studies using MALDI-TOF have shown that almost all SBG isolates correspond to the aforementioned subspecies. Most episodes with SBG isolates were in adult women, in line with a previous report that S. gallolyticus is a potential agent responsible for bacteriuria in females with a history of urological disease and/or @di$ diabetes @/di$.	1
Enhanced bacterial replication might be anticipated in an Hfe-deficient host as a result of increased iron availability, and this has been experimentally demonstrated for pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ in the setting of @di$ HH @/di$ (Quenee et al.,; Arezes et al.,; Miller et al.,).	1
Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella flexneri are the predominant diarrhoeal pathogens and those strains producing Shiga toxins cause life-threatening sequelae including @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$ (@di$ HUS @/di$) upon their entry into the host. Intimate adherence of E. coli O157 and invasion of S. flexneri in the host intestinal epithelial cells is mainly mediated by Intimin and IpaB proteins, respectively. In this study, we have synthesized chimera of immunodominant regions of Intimin (eae) and IpaB (ipaB) designated as EI and expressed it in @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ (LL-EI) to develop a combinatorial oral vaccine candidate.	2
Experiments have recently been reported in which inoculation of Clostridiales species, either as a consortium or as monotherapy with @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$, or a Bacteroidales consortium could reduce development of food allergy in OVA sensitized mice by acting through MyD88 and RORgammat. An association between @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ and A. muciniphila has also been reported in a study of overweight/@di$ obese @/di$ individuals.	2
Fecal Clostridium colonisation in infants has been linked to @di$ asthma @/di$ before: A higher level of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$-specific IgG was found in one-year-old children with recurrent wheezing. A higher prevalence of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ was detected using quantitative real-time PCR in infants who developed recurrent wheeze during the first 2 years of life. @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ belongs to Clostridium cluster XI and is only remotely related to the Clostridium coccoides subcluster XIVa species that we detected.	1
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MDD patients into germ-free mice and pseudo-germ-free rats induces @di$ depressive @/di$-like behaviors in these animals, strongly suggesting a causal role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the development of @di$ depression @/di$; the specific causal microbial species are yet to be fully elucidated. In recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that gut microbiota can trigger @di$ depression @/di$ by regulating various signaling pathways implicated in the gut-brain axis, involving the host's metabolism, inflammatory responses, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protien kinase II/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein and mitogen-activated protien kinase signaling, and the endocannabinoid system. Along with a deepening understanding of the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis, we have become aware that gut microbiota is likely important players in the diagnosis and therapy of @di$ depression @/di$ through their involvement in the bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Modulation of gut microbes is thus likely a rational and effective etiology-targeted and mechanism-oriented therapeutic approach. The recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of two live biotherapeutics Parabacteroides distasonis MRx0005 and @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ MRx0029 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease extended microbe-based therapeutics into the field of neuropsychiatry. Microbiota-based therapeutics targeting the gut-brain axis might be the next breakthrough in @di$ depression @/di$ treatment.	1
Female genital tract (FGT) microbiota composition is linked to important women's health and reproductive outcomes including HIV risk, @di$ preterm birth @/di$, mucosal inflammation, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and cervical dysplasia. Diverse, anaerobe-dominant bacterial communities are associated with negative sequelae and are a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis (BV), a syndrome involving vaginal discharge and mucosal inflammation that affects up to 58% of women worldwide, with disproportionately high impact in sub-Saharan Africa. By contrast, FGT bacterial communities dominated by @gm$ Lactobacillus crispatus @/gm$ and most other @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species are generally considered optimal for health.	2
Few studies have already shown that @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ can survive passage through the human gut. Nevertheless, it must be underlined that bacterial counts were mostly performed in the feces of human volunteers, not along the entire GI tract, and after consumption of yogurts containing both @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ and L. delbrueckii, which can affect survival of individual strains. Although survival of probiotics in the human gut involves resistance to main GI stresses, capacity to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells may also contribute to their persistence in the GI tract by promoting a transient intestinal colonization. In vitro studies have shown that few strains of @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$, especially the LMD-9 reference strain, are able to adhere to several types of human intestinal epithelial cell lines. Regarding health effects, in vitro studies and in vivo experiments in rodents have shown that @gm$ S. thermophilus @/gm$ possesses interesting properties (in addition to lactose digestion improvement) such as prevention of @di$ chronic gastritis @/di$ and antimicrobial or antioxidant activities, as reviewed by Uriot et al.	2
Fifty @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ isolates were obtained from @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$ and urinary catheter samples. Analytical profile index assays identified 47 isolates as Acinetobacter baumannii and three as @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$.	1
First, in PBC saliva, some enriched bacterial taxa, such as Prevotellaceae, Veillonella and @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, are rich in opportunistic pathogens that may have already been involved in PBC development or may have continuously impaired the health of PBC patients. For example, microabscesses were occasionally observed in the livers of animals infected by @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$. Prevotella melaninogenica is commonly cultured as the sole infectious agent in extraoral abscesses such as @di$ spondylitis @/di$, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, peritoneal abscesses and vaginal mesh infections.	1
Five kinds of species were significantly enriched in patients with @di$ fever @/di$, namely Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter unclassified, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and six species were significantly enriched in patients with non-@di$ fever @/di$, namely @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Eubacterium ramulus, and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45 (Figure 3A). This result shows that patients with @di$ fever @/di$ have significantly more pathogens but lack butyrate-producing species, which may lead to local overactivated immunity and linked to the hyperinflammation in @di$ fever @/di$. Spearman's rank correlation test also showed that the significantly enriched species in patients with @di$ fever @/di$ were associated with the clinical indices. For example, S. cerevisiae was positively correlated with diarrhea (rho=0.55, p=0.001), and E. faecalis was positively correlated with LDH (rho=0.54, p=0.002) and D-dimer (rho=0.55, p=0.001), and negatively correlated with CD8+T cells (rho=-0.42, p=0.02) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) (rho=-0.42, p=0.02) (Figure 3B). Among the significantly enriched species in patients with non-@di$ fever @/di$, E.	0
Five strains of @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ isolated from permafrost samples aged from 15 thousand to 1.8 million years were selected from this collection for the comparative analysis of genomes. Representatives of this species are known to exist both in the environment and on human skin and mucous membrane. In addition, strains of this species have been increasingly reported as hospital pathogens associated with @di$ bacteremia @/di$.	1
For 35 of those, samples were available for further analysis by additional diagnostic methods such as culture, sequencing, PCR, @di$ FTD @/di$-PCR or serology; some cases therefore had results from multiple diagnostic tests. A total of 30 cases were classified as L. longbeachae; six by culture, four by 16S-sequencing, two by paired serology, 12 by @di$ FTD @/di$-PCR and six by serology with a single high titre. In total, two cases were classified as @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$; one by culture and one by serology with a single high titre.	0
For example, Salmonella enterica serovar Anatis presents as an asymptomatic phenotype, while @di$ septicemia @/di$ caused by @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ may lead to death.	1
For example, it has been detected from @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ and A. hydrophila isolated from humans in China, Aeromonas spp. from reservoir water in Singapore, A. media in Nebraska watershed, A. salmonicida from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) in Chile, and pork processing plant in Spain. Similarly, blaOXA-724 has been detected from A. dhakensis isolated from humans in Spain, A. hydrophila from pigs in South Africa as well as A. jandaei and A. hydrophila from chicken and catfish in the United States, while in the present study it was found in A. hydrophila from carp and A. veronii from sardine from India. blaOXA-72 has been detected from Acinetobacter baumannii in humans where it has been associated with @di$ pneumonia @/di$, septic shock, and respiratory failure.	1
For example, the relative abundance of the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum, Parabacteroides merdae, and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, which promote tumor immunotherapy response, were significantly increased after consumption of H. erinaceus. Additionally, the bacteria Roseburia intestinalis, which is associated with not responding to tumor immunotherapy, was downregulated. Also, H. erinaceus supplementation could reverse the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria enriched or reduced in some diseases, such as Bacteroides caccae enriched in metabolic arthritis patients, Phascolarctobacterium enriched in kidney stones patients, Romboutsia timonensis enriched in patients with the @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$, Streptococcus thermophilus that is a predictor of poor prognosis for liver cirrhosis, and Coprococcus comes decreased in patients with chronic widespread pain.	0
For instance, @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, even if not significantly differentially abundant among the analyzed groups, was related to the highest number of DEmiRNAs, followed by R. bicirculans. @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ abundances progressively decreased in stool from tCD-TG+ and tCD-TG- to controls. Conversely, R. bicirculans had an opposite trend with increasing abundances going from tCD-TG+ to controls. Although the literature concerning this bacterium is still scarce, a recent study supported its ability to utilize certain hemicelluloses, especially beta-glucans and xyloglucan for its growth. In addition, an increased abundance of this bacterium has been reported in relation to a high-protein low-fat weight reduction diet and a low calorie weight loss diet supplemented with resistant starch. This is in line with the previously mentioned lower starch intake and related metabolism observed for the tCD groups, which could partially explain its reduction in those categories. Moreover, R. bicirculans lower abundance was recently associated with @di$ pulmonary arterial hypertension @/di$ severity and alopecia areata. Considering its abundance reduction, especially in the tCD-TG+, its possible involvement in inflammatory/autoimmune processes cannot be excluded. Interestingly, a high abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and a low representation of the Ruminococcus genus were observed in stool samples of a Rhesus macaque model of CD.	0
Four pats were analyzed for Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, and enterococci, and four inoculated pats were analyzed for @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ and Salmonella enterica. Two pats were placed on drainage collectors, and another pat was fitted with a temperature probe. In the first 1 to 3 weeks, there were increases (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude) in the counts of enterococci (in four seasons), E. coli (three seasons), fecal streptococci (three seasons), and S. enterica (two seasons), but there was no increase in the counts of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$. Thereafter, the counts decreased, giving an average ranking of the times necessary for 90% inactivation of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ (6.2 days from deposition) < fecal streptococci (35 days) < S. enterica (38 days) < E. coli (48 days) < enterococci (56 days). The pat temperature probably influenced bacterial growth, but the pattern of increases and decreases was primarily determined by desiccation; growth occurred when the water content was greater than 80%, but at a water content of 70 to 75% counts decreased. E. coli and enterococcus regrowth appeared to result from pat rehydration. Of 20 monthly leaching losses of E. coli, 16 were <10% of the total counts in the pat, and 12 were <1%. Drainage losses of @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ (generally <1%) were detected for only 1 to 2 months. Although enterococci exhibited the best survival rate, higher final counts suggested that E. coli is the more practical indicator of bovine @di$ fecal pollution @/di$.	1
From the total isolates, 27.4 % of the recovered species were @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$. Patients who are infected with @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ are not essentially developing gas gangrene; the disease can display a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Recently, it has become apparent that the presence of @gm$ clostridium perfringens @/gm$ is unusual, but not rare, causes of @di$ tissue and bloodstream infections @/di$. Studies in which blood samples were obtained from patients in tertiary-care facilities have shown that @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ were the most frequently identified pathogens accounted for 20% to 50% of isolates. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a retrospective study carried from 1990 through 1997 to determine the incidence and @gm$ clostridium @/gm$ species among the inpatients, the main @gm$ clostridium @/gm$ species were Perfringens with an incidence rate of 21.7%. The main source of the infection was the gastrointestinal tract. The high rate in our study may be due to the fact that women in rural areas experiences unattended labor, during bearing down they soiled the perineum with fecal matter. These organisms may get access to the blood through fecally infected episiotomy and decircumcision; wounds leading to @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ bacteremia.	1
Furthermore, ATC supplementation significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the relative abundance of Shuttleworthia, Succinivibrio, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Ruminococcus, and Paludibacter but increased that of Phascolarctobacterium, Megasphaera, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella in the experimental group compared with that in the control group. Notably, ATC supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P < 0.05), which is involved in anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ activities, gut barrier enhancement, and butyrate production.	2
Furthermore, other groups have reported the benefits of @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ for folate supplementation and its inhibitory effects on food allergies, pollinosis, tumors, serum cholesterol, and hypertension. In addition, strain H61 was shown to suppress aging-associated symptoms, such as @di$ osteoporosis @/di$ and hearing loss, in senescence-accelerated mice.	2
Genera of @gm$ Faecalitalea @/gm$, Lachnoclostridium, Butyricimonas and Roseburia presented a correlation with the metabolic process of OA to some extent, especially @gm$ Faecalitalea @/gm$. @gm$ Faecalitalea @/gm$ belongs to the Firmicutes, which can ferment D-glucose, sucrose, D-mannose and raffinose, and the main end product of metabolism is butyric acid. The strong correlation with OA metabolism makes it a potential OA-degrading bacterium. Furthermore, @gm$ Faecalitalea @/gm$ might protect intestinal barrier function by producing short-chain fatty acids, which also makes it a potential beneficial bacterium for the clinical treatment of @di$ DSP @/di$.	2
Given the link between ER stress, mucus production, and @di$ inflammation @/di$, many researchers and clinicians have begun looking into reducing ER stress as a potential therapeutic target for IBD. Our work points to the novel role of @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ in alleviating ER stress, promoting mucus production, and minimizing @di$ inflammation @/di$. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ is already a member of the healthy human gut microbiome and could be employed to promote a healthy gut. Based on these findings, we believe that @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ could serve as a next-generation probiotic for intestinal diseases associated with ER stress and disrupted mucus, such as IBD.	2
Gomes et al have shown that Prevotella spp is associated with pain and @di$ swelling @/di$ and 'wet' canal of oral diseases. Besides, Prevotella intermdedia, @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella meleninogenica are known to be pathogenic under a wide range of situations and invade into the host tissues.	1
Group 2 included @di$ diabetic @/di$ untreated rats fed high-fat feed and treated with streptozotocin (STZ, N-methyl nitroso-carbomyl; Sigma-Aldrich, Jakarta, Indonesia) starting at 40 mg/kg on day 25 (P2). Group 3 included @di$ diabetic @/di$ rats fed high-fat feed, treated with STZ starting on day 25, and fed 2 mL of milk fermented with P. acidilactici strain BE (1x108 CFU/mL) for 15 days starting on day 29 (P3). Group 4 included @di$ diabetic @/di$ rats fed high-fat feed, treated with STZ starting on day 25, and fed 2 mL of milk fermented with @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ strain M103 (1x108 CFU/mL) for 15 days starting on day 29 (P4). Group 5 included @di$ diabetic @/di$ rats fed high-fat feed, treated with STZ starting on day 25, and then treated with metformin (45 mg/kg) for 15 days starting on day 29 (P5).	2
Grouped according to cognitive function, we found that the abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ and Gemmiger decreased (P < 0.005) in cognitively impaired subjects (Figures 4B, C). Interestingly, we found that the abundance of @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$, Gemmiger and Escherichia also varied significantly in @di$ AUD @/di$ patients.	1
He developed @di$ respiratory failure @/di$ before recovering. Cultures from his lower airways grew Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Samples from his home and workplace did not identify @gm$ Legionella @/gm$. On further questioning it was discovered that the patient regularly sat beside an outdoor fountain during his breaks from work. Samples from the fountain identified high numbers of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ serogroup 1, sequence type 256. Full genome sequencing showed that isolates from the patient and fountain were identical. The fountain used recirculated water with small amounts of chlorine. High outdoor temperatures in Oslo may have facilitated growth of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ in the fountain. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first published case of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ transmission from an outdoor fountain.	1
Here we analyse longitudinal stool samples from 903 children between 3 and 46 months of age by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (n = 12,005) and metagenomic sequencing (n = 10,867), as part of the The Environmental Determinants of @di$ Diabetes @/di$ in the Young (TEDDY) study. We show that the developing gut microbiome undergoes three distinct phases of microbiome progression: a developmental phase (months 3-14), a transitional phase (months 15-30), and a stable phase (months 31-46). Receipt of breast milk, either exclusive or partial, was the most significant factor associated with the microbiome structure. Breastfeeding was associated with higher levels of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species (B. breve and @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$), and the cessation of breast milk resulted in faster maturation of the gut microbiome, as marked by the phylum Firmicutes.	2
Here, the genus Finegoldia (formerly @gm$ Peptostreptococcus @/gm$) was identified in a high percentage in all three study groups with the highest number detected in the group of patients undergoing dialysis. Finegoldia are Gram-negative anaerobic opportunistic microorganisms that colonize the skin and mucous membranes. The representative of this genus, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus prevotii @/gm$ was often identified in men with non-gonococcal urethritis, while Peptostreptococcus magnus was the most common anaerobic species detected in patients without urethritis. Finegoldia is also present in the urine of both sexually active adult males and sexually inactive adolescents. In another study, two specific species of Finegoldia found in the urine of the bladder, including Finegoldia magna, were associated with preoperative worsening of urinary symptoms in women undergoing stress urinary incontinence and @di$ pelvic prolapse @/di$.	1
Here, we further evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activities of OBP-4 against @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ and its absorption (A), distribution (D), and excretion (E) profiles in rats. In vitro assays indicated that OBP-4 was active against all tested @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ strains, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/liter. In addition, OBP-4 showed complete inhibition of spore formation at 0.5x MIC. In the mouse model of CDI, 5-day oral treatment with OBP-4 provided complete protection from death and CDI recurrence in infected mice. However, cadazolid (CZD) and vancomycin (VAN) showed less protection of infected mice than did OBP-4 in terms of diarrhea and @di$ weight loss @/di$, especially VAN. Subsequently, ADE investigations of OBP-4 with a reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method showed extremely low systemic exposure and predominantly fecal excretion, resulting in a high local concentration of OBP-4 in the intestinal tract-the site of CDI. These results demonstrated that OBP-4 possesses good activity against @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ and favorable ADE characteristics for oral treatment of CDI, which support further development of OBP-4 as a potential anti-CDI agent.	2
Higher relative abundance of Streptococcus sobrinus and @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ was observed in plaque samples in the reference group. By qPCR, Scardovia wiggsiae was associated with elevated sugar intake. The findings suggests that the amount of ingested sugars had a marginal influence on microbial profiles in dental plaque and saliva. However, some @di$ caries @/di$-associated species were less abundant in the dental plaque of the low sugar group.	1
However, @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were lower in Landrace piglets than Meihua piglets (P < 0.05) (Figure 4B). The species @di$ Neisseria meningitides @/di$ exists in Landrace but was not present in Meihua piglets.	0
However, SCFAs may prevent @di$ obesity @/di$ by activating GPR43. GPR43 is associated with metabolic activity of the gut microbiota with host body energy homoeostasis processes, such as glycolipid metabolism, via suppressing insulin signaling in adipocytes. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the primary phyla and Butyricicoccus, Blautia, and Phascolarctobacterium are the primary genera in the gut microbiota that have an important role in SCFAs metabolism. In addition, SCFAs can be produced by bacteria in the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Lachnospira, and Prevotella . SCFAs are positively associated with Prevotella, Alistipes, and Barnesiella and negatively associated with Bacteroides and Enterococcus. Prevotellaceae bacteria are enriched in @di$ obesity @/di$. Lachnospira, as SCFA producer, has a negative correlation with body weight. Fecal SCFA level showed negative relation with bacterial diversity, and 70 unique microbial taxa had relationship with at least one SCFAs (acetate, butyrate, or propionate). Jacobo de la Cuesta-Zuluaga studied the relationship of fecal SCFAs, gut microbiota, gut permeability, and cardiometabolic outcomes, including @di$ obesity @/di$ and hypertension in 441 community-dwelling adults. High fecal SCFAs, @di$ obesity @/di$, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors represented higher abundance of several disease-associated microbiota, including Enterobacter hormaechei, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus, and SMB53. Lower fecal SCFAs showed higher abundance of some beneficial microbes. Christensenellaceae, Methanobrevibacter, and Oscillospira had relationship with lower BMI, weight. Alistipes and Bacteroides associated with decreased @di$ obesity @/di$.	2
However, in an initial phase, numerous patients exhibit watery @di$ diarrhea @/di$ that may or may not be followed by dysentery. New virulence factors associated with the species of Shigella have recently been described. These are enterotoxins 1 and 2 of Shigella (ShET-1 and ShET-2, respectively). The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of ShET-1 and ShET-2 in species of Shigella isolated from patients with @di$ traveler's diarrhea @/di$. During the period from 1993 to 1998, stool samples from 500 travelers with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ were cultured for the isolation of Shigella spp. and other enteropathogens. The detection of ShET-1 and ShET-2 was performed by a PCR technique with specific primers. Among a total of 51 strains of Shigella isolated during this period (22 S. flexneri, 26 @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$, and 3 S. dysenteriae strains), at least one enterotoxin was detected in 31 (60.78%) strains; 2 (9.09%; both of which were S. flexneri strains) produced only ShET-1, while 21 (41.17%; 3 S. flexneri, 15 @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$, and 3 S.	1
However, we observed that the lack of AM was associated with a decreased abundance of two beneficial bacteria such as @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ and B. choerinum (and also of the Bifidobacterium genus), which could suggest that the decrease in the numbers of these bacteria is associated with the worsening of DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ observed in KO mice. In fact, @gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ has anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the severity of @di$ colitis @/di$ in a mouse model (Carroll et al.,). Also, administration of certain strains of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium improved DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ (Toumi et al.,).	2
Hydrazone 16b demonstrated convincing anticancer effect against all tested cell cultures such as human @di$ prostate carcinoma @/di$ PPC-1 and human kidney carcinoma CaKi-1 cell lines, and human fibroblasts HF, n = 3. The most promising compound 16b showed higher activity against CaKi-1 cell line than the anticancer drugs axitinib and pazopanib used to treat renal cancer. Also, it was more active in the PPC-1 cell line compared to the approved PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Hydrazone 16b was also found to possess good antimicrobial properties against gram-positive bacteria strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$.	0
ICI-induced toxicity and @di$ colitis @/di$, for which preliminary immunological, genomic and microbiology biomarkers are available, were less associated with the microbiome in our study, in which 43% and 36% of individuals experienced grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events in PRIMM-UK and PRIMM-NL, respectively (Methods). Within PRIMM-NL, E. hallii and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ were both found to be significantly associated with the absence of @di$ colitis @/di$ before ICI treatment, whereas no significant species emerged from the analyses of PRIMM-UK samples.	2
IgE/Ag-mediated @di$ passive cutaneous anaphylaxis @/di$ (@di$ PCA @/di$) is one of the well-studied paradigms for testing the type-1 hypersensitivity in vivo. Mast cells are also used to study anti-allergic responses linked to the reduced mast cell degranulation and expression of inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ (SC11) fermentation on GRC enhanced its bio-functional nature, and inhibited type I hypersensitivity reactions in RBL-2H3 cells and in mice.	2
Imbalances in this microbiota have been associated with negative reproductive outcomes, such as spontaneous @di$ preterm birth @/di$ (sPTB), but the mechanisms underlying the association between a disturbed microbiota and sPTB remain poorly understood. An intrauterine infection ascending from the vagina is thought to be an important contributor to the onset of @di$ preterm labour @/di$. Our objective was to characterize the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women who had sPTB (n = 46) and compare to those of pregnant women who delivered at term (n = 170). Vaginal swabs were collected from women at 11-16 weeks of gestational age. Microbiota profiles were created by PCR amplification and pyrosequencing of the cpn60 universal target region. RESULTS: Profiles clustered into seven community state types: I (@gm$ Lactobacillus crispatus @/gm$ dominated), II (Lactobacillus gasseri dominated), III (Lactobacillus iners dominated), IVA (Gardnerella vaginalis subgroup B or mix of species), IVC (G. vaginalis subgroup A dominated), IVD (G. vaginalis subgroup C dominated) and V (Lactobacillus jensenii dominated). The microbiota of women who experienced @di$ preterm birth @/di$ (< 37 weeks gestation) had higher richness and diversity and higher Mollicutes prevalence when compared to those of women who delivered at term.	1
Immune dysfunction may be a high-risk factor for the infection of @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. There were two cases of abnormal immune function in our hospital and one case reported in the literatures. Infants and children under 3 years old are more likely to have congenital malformations [two cases in our hospital, and four cases in the literature reports ]. Adults are more likely to have urinary tract infections; possibly because urinary catheters are more commonly used in adult patients. It has been reported before that @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ has the ability to form biofilms inside the catheters. The ability to colonize the inner surfaces of the indwelling urinary catheters is a main reason of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections. Case analysis on adults suggests that invasive procedures may increase the risk of contracting @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. This suggestion is in accordance with our findings analyzing the infection cases in children: 6/14 patients underwent mechanical ventilation, 5/14 had indwelling catheters, 3/14 underwent surgery, 3/14 underwent tumor chemotherapy, and 1/14 underwent blood purification for four times. @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ bacteria form biofilms on invasive devices such as venous catheters and mechanical ventilations, thus increasing the risk of infection. This could also explain a higher number of @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ blood stream infections in children, as venous catheters are often used for their treatment. Further, fever is the most common clinical manifestation, however newborns with infection of this bacteria were mainly diagnosed with @di$ dyspnea @/di$ and hypoxemia.	1
Improved glucose homeostasis by metformin treatment, the most used antidiabetic drug, in diet-induced @di$ obese @/di$ mice was highly correlated with increased A. muciniphila. Supplementation with A. muciniphila improved metabolic parameters in overweight/@di$ obese @/di$ insulin-resistant humans. Concord grape polyphenols and epigallocatechin gallate from green tea increased A. muciniphila with improved metabolic outcomes. We did not observe any changes in the gut microbiome in the GG-treated group. Like muscle data, the dose we used in this study may not be sufficient to alter gut microbiome composition. Previously, we showed a 800 mg/kg diet of GGOH (vs. 400 mg/kg diet in this study) increased the relative abundance of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum and decreased the abundance of Dorea longicatena compared to the control group. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the dose-response test. @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, another butylate-producing species, was increased with GTPs in high-fat-diet-induced insulin-resistant mice. An increased abundance of @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ was highly correlated with HDL cholesterol levels and negatively correlated with fat mass and insulin resistance in humans. Previous studies suggested that butyrate-producing bacterial species, such as A. muciniphila and @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, regulate skeletal muscle metabolism and function; thus, the validation of causality warrants future study.	2
In 1985, an outbreak of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ occurred in June and July (during the rainy season), which was linked to V. parahaemolyticus . Moreover, additional outbreaks of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ occurred due to infections with other natural host of freshwater or saltwater, i.e., @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$, A. hydrophila, and A. sobria . In 2001, several outbreaks of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ occurred, causing casualties in several parts of Cote d'Ivoire .	1
In 41 of these a bacterial infection was confirmed: infection due to Yersinia enterocolitica in 21, Campylobacter jejuni in 15, Salmonella B in 3, Salmonella C in 1, and @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ in 1. In the other 20 bacteriological tests were negative (10) or not done (10). Oral barium studies, done in 15 patients, showed thickening of the terminal ileum in all of them. Only 22 of the 61 patients had @di$ diarrhoea @/di$.	1
In @di$ IBD @/di$ patients, a reduction of butyrate-producing species abundance was observed correlated with changes in the composition of fecal organic acids compared with healthy subjects (Nemoto et al.,). The importance of butyrate-producing species in gut microbiota relies on this compound's anti-inflammatory activity (Klampfer et al.,; Schwab et al.,). Butyrate has a crucial role in gut physiology, as it is an energy source for the intestinal mucosa and promotes the growth and differentiation of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) (Stein,; Hamer et al.,; Topping and Clifton,). Furthermore, intestinal organic acids, among which butyrate is an important one, have immunomodulatory effects on colonic inflammation and a reinforcing effect on the intestinal defense barrier (Stein,; Cavaglieri et al.,; Hamer et al.,). Evidences pointed toward a critical role of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia species, and @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ species (Sokol et al.,; Louis and Flint,; Lopez-siles et al.,). For instance, F. prausnitzii can account for up to 20% of fecal microbiota in healthy individuals (Lopez-Siles et al.,), and a reduced relative prevalence and abundance in gut diseases either in fecal or mucosal samples, in particular in @di$ IBD @/di$, have also been described (Sokol et al.,; Lopez-siles et al.,; Chatel et al.,). On the contrary, the higher contribution of microbes such as Escherichia coli to the gut microbiome can dramatically affect gut epithelial integrity, thus increasing epithelial barrier dysfunction and @di$ IBD @/di$ physiopathology (Mirsepasi-lauridsen et al.,).	2
In @di$ PACM @/di$, the loach displayed a greater abundance of total bacteria, the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila in the intestinal contents and mucosa than found in the rearing water in the summer samples as compared with the autumn samples, except the difference was not significant for Lactobacillus spp. (Table 5). Considerable variation in the fish mucosa was detected in different seasons, including different abundances of total bacteria, the Bacteroidetes and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$. In summer, the abundances of total bacteria, the Firmicutes, the Bacteroidetes, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and some pathogenic bacteria (A. hydrophila) were remarkably higher in the mucosa than in the water, and the difference was significant (P < 0.01) for the Firmicutes, Enterococcus spp., A. hydrophila and Streptococcus spp. Moreover, substantial amplification difference was observed in the summer contents, such as the abundance of total bacteria, the Bacteroidetes, Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of Enterococcus spp. also differed remarkably between seasons (P < 0.05). In contrast, the abundances of most bacteria presented a reverse trend in the fall, becoming greater in the culture water than in the intestinal contents and mucosa (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Interestingly, the abundances of all the bacterial groups, except for @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus spp., were significantly higher in the culture water than in the fish gut (P < 0.01) (Fig.	0
In a Mayo Clinic study published in 2017, 26 participants (18 to 65 years) were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic @di$ Obesity @/di$ Treatment Research Program, and the body weight was measured at the beginning and after 3 months of this program. At least 5% weight loss after 3 months was defined as success. Gut microbiome composition was compared between the success and failure groups. Two genera were identified with significant changes according to the LEfSe analysis (LDA score > 2), and the remaining ones were non-significant. Increased Phascolarcobacterium abundance was associated with success (P = 0.008), and increased Dialister abundance was associated with failure of weight loss (P = 0.030). Strikingly, species in these two genera were among the six HAHFC species identified in this study: Dialister sp. CAG486 was the most enriched bacterial species in the @di$ obese @/di$ cat microbiome with a 1,500-fold increase; @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ was highly abundant in the normal cat gut microbiome, but almost missing in the @di$ obese @/di$ cat gut microbiome with a 400-fold reduction in abundance. Based on the human gut microbiome study on weight loss outcomes and our results in @di$ obese @/di$ cats, high levels of Dialister may prevent body weight loss, and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ was associated with lean microbiomes by promoting body weight loss.	2
In a clinical study Fosfomycin was given to 26 patients with infections mainly of the middle ear and mastoid as well as other @di$ ENT-infections @/di$. Clinical success, laboratory investigations and bacteriology are described in detail. The drug proved to be of special value in the treatment of chronic purulent otitis, purulent or chronic secreting tympanoplasties or other postoperative middle-ear affections when caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococci, proteus-species and @gm$ pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$.	1
In a previous study, @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ pneumonia was observed in twenty patients over a ninety-one-month period. Half of these cases had hospital-acquired pneumonia and three had ventilator associated pneumonia. The patients diagnosed with @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ presented a medical history of solid cancer, immunodeficiency, @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ or chronic alcoholics.	0
In a recent report on the treatment of a 7-year-old girl with @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ septic arthritis and @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ (see Question 1), there was upregulation of genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity in response to i.v.	1
In a recent study of @di$ vertebral osteomyelitis @/di$ caused by NTM, various degrees of immunosuppression were found in 17 (51.5%) of 33 patients. From the 31 patients with spinal infection studied, the following NTM species were recovered: MAC (n = 13), M. xenopi (n = 7), M. fortuitum (n = 5), M. abscessus (n = 3), @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ (n = 1), M. simiae (n = 1), and unidentified NTM species (n = 1). M. hemophilum also causes NTM @di$ osteomyelitis infections @/di$ in bone marrow and solid organ transplants. The hand and wrist are the most frequently reported sites of NTM tenosynovitis because of their abundance of synovial fluid and tissue combined with a higher probability of penetrating injury. Most frequently, M. marinum and @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ are involved; less frequently, M.	1
In a study of faeces from 475 slaughter-age cattle and sheep from 19 herds or flocks, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species (C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$) were cultured from all production systems studied and from 73.7 per cent (14/19) of herds or flocks. Within individual properties there was a higher prevalence in cattle than in sheep, with @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ being most commonly isolated from feedlot cattle. The median prevalences and ranges were: for dairy cattle, six per cent (0-24%), feedlot beef cattle, 58 per cent (12-92%) pasture beef cattle, two per cent (0-52%), mutton sheep, 0 per cent (0-4%) and prime lambs eight per cent. Listeria ivanovii was cultured from one dairy cow but Yersinia enterocolitica was not cultured from any animal. @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ is the leading bacterial causative agent of acute @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in humans in many industrialised countries.	1
In addition to Bacteroides, the bacterial core also includes taxa normally identified in the human gut microbiota such as the succinate-utilizing @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ and some beneficial butyrate-producing genera such as Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira (which have never been cultivated and are related to lean status and health). Collinsella, which belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria, has been found to be significantly increased in type 2 diabetes compared to prediabetic and non-@di$ diabetic @/di$ American subjects.	1
In addition to Staphylococcus aureus, other bacteria or fungi species such as Candida glabrata, Actinobacillus, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, Pneumococcus, Salmonella enteritidis and @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species can cause SEA. Diabetes mellitus, intravenous drugs, @di$ alcohol abuse @/di$, and immunosuppression predispose to infections resulting in SEA.	0
In addition to the above study there have been a number of sporadic reports of the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from a range of body sites. For example, Johnson and Finegold reported the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from a diabetic foot ulcer of a patient with underlying osteomyelitis. Further, in a report on Campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses, @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was one member of a polymicrobial flora isolated from a @di$ brain abscess @/di$ of a patient who had previously undergone craniotomy for maxillary sinus carcinoma (de Vries et al.,). Despite antibiotic therapy the patient later died from an intracerebral infection due to chronic sinusitis (de Vries et al.,). In this case it is likely that @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was an opportunistic pathogen, an interpretation that may also explain the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from human blood samples (Lastovica,). Further, following a survey of pediatric records Lastovica reported the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from stool specimens of nine liver transplant patients, six patients with biliary atresia and three with renal transplants or renal failure (Lastovica,). While a role for @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in these diseases cannot be confirmed, these results in combination with the finding of micro-abscesses in the livers of two mice infected with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ (Aabenhus et al.,), raises the possibility of an association between this bacterium and hepatobiliary disease.	1
In addition, AHPND is a serious shrimp bacterial disease caused by a pathogenic strain of Gram-negative @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ bacteria known as VpAHPND. The VpAHPND bacteria contain a 70-kbp plasmid (pVA1) capable of producing Photorhabdus insect-related (Pir) toxins, PirA and PirB. AHPND had emerged in China since year 2009 which then spread to Southeast Asia and Mexico regions. This disease can cause 40-100% mortality within early 35 days shrimp post-stocking. AHPND disease outbreaks had been reported for P. monodon, L. vannamei, and Fenneropenaeus chinensis. The gross clinical signs of AHPND disease include slow growth, @di$ lethargy @/di$, pale and atrophied hepatopancreas, empty stomach, and empty gut. Intriguingly, despite being susceptible to Vibriosis disease caused by @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ bacteria, M.	1
In addition, DHEA was able to alleviate @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice and reduce the abundance of Pseudomonas (Cao et al., ). This indicates that in different disease models, DHEA may reduce inflammation by regulating different microbiota. TCM has been widely used in the treatment of diseases, and research has also found that Xiaoyaosan can increase the abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ to treat colorectal cancer (Zhao et al., ). Compound Agrimony Enteritis Capsules can increase the relative abundance of probiotics in @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and inhibit IL-6 production (Li et al., ). In addition, the TCM Gui-fu-di-huang-wan can increase the abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ in the body and regulate the microbiota structure and metabolite levels (Jing et al., ). Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TCM and DHEA in the treatment of human diseases, and that TCM can modulate the abundance of microbiota, including @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$.	2
In addition, Parisa et al using in vivo and in vitro studies that bifidobacterium inhibits @di$ CRC @/di$ by down-regulating HER-2, EGFR, and PTGS-2 (COX-2). Chou et al used azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis-associated @di$ CRC @/di$ in ICR mice. After 14 weeks of treatment with Lactobacillus fermentum V3 (1 108 CFU/d) (5 days/week, once a day), Compared with the control group, the levels of lactobacillus in feces were significantly increased, and the abundance of harmful bacteria, Bacteroides and Akkermansia, was markedly decreased. Pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were dramatically reduced. The infiltration of CD68+ macrophages in tumors was reduced, and tumor growth was observably inhibited. More recently, Chung et al synthesized stable synthetic probiotics using @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ and P8 therapy protein that ameliorated azoxyMethane and Dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis-associated @di$ CRC @/di$ impaired flora, while tumor growth and tumor volume were significantly inhibited.	2
In addition, an association was found between the gut microbiota and the infant's nutritional status for Streptococcus, Clostridium leptum and @gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ bacterial groups, which were significantly increased in infants with @di$ malnutrition @/di$. This finding supports that @di$ malnutrition @/di$ may be a possible determinant of faecal microbiota and it could be hypothesized that gut microbiota and @di$ malnutrition @/di$ have a common cause or similar determinants.	1
In addition, oral administration of Akkermansia muciniphila has been shown to decrease body weight and the levels of blood markers related to @di$ liver dysfunction @/di$ in overweight and obese humans. Thus, the administration of intestinal microorganisms has valuable clinical applications for the treatment of several diseases, including psoriasis. Administration of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM667, @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ CCFM1078, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei CCFM1074, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri CCFM1132 ameliorated psoriasis-like pathological characteristics in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice. In addition, results of clinical trials showed that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 reduced systemic proinflammatory biomarkers in patients with psoriasis. As a new treatment, interventions of intestinal microbiology for psoriasis is promising. However, many interventions, including the administration of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ in the treatment of psoriasis, have unclear mechanisms.	2
In addition, we also verified this in the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like skin mouse model. After administration of gentamicin for 10 days (twice a day), mice were treated with IMQ for 5 days. During the treatment of IMQ, gentamicin group mice were still gavaged with gentamicin (once a day). After administration of gentamicin for 15 days, an abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ was decreased while the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis was increased in the colonic contents of mice (Supplementary Fig. 6l, n). Our results showed that administration of gentamicin alleviated pathogenesis of @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like symptoms, including alleviating psoriasiform skin inflammation, a decrease in the skin epidermis thickness, decreasing mRNA expression of IL-17A, IL-23, S100A7, and increased mRNA expression of KRT10 (Supplementary Fig. 6a-i). What's more, gentamicin group mice showed a less infiltration of Th17 cells in the skin lesion area and less differentiation of Th17 cells in the DLN than control group mice (Supplementary Fig. 6j, k, m). However, gentamicin was less effective in alleviating psoriasiform skin inflammation in IMQ @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like skin mouse model than in the K14-VEGF mouse model, probably due to the higher colonization of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Parabacteroides distasonis in the colon of K14-VEGF mice than IMQ-induced mice. In summary, these results indicated that administration of gentamicin depleted the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and thus alleviated the pathogenesis of @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like skin phenotype in K14-VEGF mice and IMQ-induced mice with the decreased infiltration of Th17.	2
In both IVOC and @di$ GPA @/di$, S. dysenteriae 1 was the most invasive as compared to S. flexneri and S. sonnei. S. sonnei was the least invasive. ELISA demonstrated that S. sonnei dampened the HBD (human beta-defensin)-2 responses whereas there was augmentation by @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ and there was a modest but non-significant increase by S.	1
In both studies, some subjects reported mild events, primarily GI-related (ie, lower abdominal pain, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, and hematochezia). The mean plasma concentration-time profiles at day 1 and day 14 found that DS2969a (free form of DS-2969b) plasma concentrations increased with increasing doses; however, both the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased less than the dose proportionally. Both studies found that the target fecal level 10 mug of DS-2969a per gram of feces of DS-2969b (Kumar M et al, unpublished data, 2018) that was sufficient in clearing C. difficile with doses of 60 mg or higher. DS-2969b reduced the @gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium groups with a minimal effect on Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium leptum, and Prevotella spp, which demonstrates a mild effect on intestinal microbiota.	1
In conclusion, we have shown that a recombinant P139-512 polypeptide expressed and purified from @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ cells preserves the relevant antigenic and immunogenic determinants of the native S. mutans adhesin. Because recombinant purified antigens represent an important approach for the development of vaccines against @di$ dental caries @/di$ and systemic damage caused by S. mutans, the ability to utilize @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ as a promising new expression system represents an additional tool for the generation of recombinant antigens with application in acellular-based vaccines.	2
In conclusion, we identified genotypic and phenotypic variant strains of ST258 @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ from blood cultures of individual patients. Clinical implications of such genetic and phenotypic diversity during @di$ BSIs @/di$ and other infections will be defined in the years to come, with potentially profound implications for medical, clinical microbiology laboratory and infection prevention practices, and for better understanding of emergence of antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis.	1
In contrast to the broad conservation of plant disease traits across  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ , bongkrekic acid-producing strains associated with fatal human food poisoning were more closely related. They were designated group 1 by their ANI relatedness (Fig. 1) and the conserved presence of the bongkrekic acid BGC in these strains adds weight to the call for their differentiation as a toxin-producing  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$  subgroup. With 13 % of the  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$  CF isolates examined containing the bongkrekic acid BGC, toxin production is a worrying potential risk factor for @di$ CF lung infections @/di$, especially as this can occur under lung infection-like growth conditions, such as artificial @di$ CF @/di$ sputum. The clinical outcome of  Burkholderia  infection is frequently highly variable and severe systemic disease has been associated with  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$  in @di$ CF @/di$. With the ability to rapidly identify bongkrekic acid-positive  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$  isolates using a PCR diagnostic (Fig. S5), we are now in a strong position to understand whether the toxin plays a role in poor clinical outcome for infected @di$ CF @/di$ patients. Also, since we have shown that trimethoprim acts to suppress toxin production (Fig. 6), rather than activate it, a case can be made for therapy with the antibiotic to be maintained in bongkrekic acid-positive  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$  CF infections.	1
In contrast, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, another potential HCC marker, is widely regarded as a probiotic that can be used in fecal transplantation to treat disease. @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ was found to be age-enriched in centenarians, and it may aid in health maintenance. @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ was shown to be useful in treating colitis and colorectal cancer by stimulating IL-6 and IL-1 production and Th17 cell expansion. @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ was found in this study to be significantly lower in HCC and @di$ LC @/di$ than in NC, and it is expected to be a new therapeutic target for HCC.	2
In feed samples of the rabbitry @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ strains of the serotypes 1/2b and 4b besides the apathogenic Listeria species Listeria seeligeri and Listeria innocua were detected. Serological studies with agglutination test and complement fixation test on double serum samples of does, which had aborted, pointed to listeric infections as the cause of abortion. A doe, which had aborted and failed to become pregnant again, showed serosal adhesions of both uterine tubes and a sterile pyometra. Therefore, previous infection of the uterus by @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ should be considered as a cause of @di$ infertility @/di$.	1
In intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and atopy. However, the Lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. For accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rRNA intergenic spacer regions, were developed for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, @gm$ Lactobacillus delbrueckii @/gm$, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different Lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (SF) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (OSF). A breast-fed group (BF) was studied in parallel as a reference. During the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the BF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the OSF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). The Lactobacillus species distribution in the OSF group was comparable to breast-fed infants, with relatively high levels of L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and L. casei. The SF-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more @gm$ L. delbrueckii @/gm$ and less L.	2
In linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, current smoking, and @di$ diabetes @/di$, number of antibiotic courses associated significantly with low periodontal inflammation burden index (PIBI, p < 0.001), bleeding on probing (BOP, p = 0.006), and alveolar bone loss (ABL, p = 0.042). Cephalosporins associated with all the parameters. The phyla mainly affected by the antibiotics were Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes. Their levels were inversely associated with the number of prescriptions (p = 0.010 and p < 0.001) and directly associated with the time since the last prescription (p = 0.019 and p < 0.001). Significant inverse associations were observed between the number of prescriptions and saliva concentrations of Prevotella intermedia, @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$, and Treponema denticola and subgingival bacterial amounts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. intermedia, @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$, and T.	2
In mice, persistent airway infection with @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ or Staphylococcus aureus triggers peribronchial TLS, but TLS germinal centers are absent in the lungs of lymphocyte-depleted mice. Lymphatic follicles containing germinal centers are associated with various chronic airway diseases, such as COPD and severe @di$ asthma @/di$.	1
In mouse models, the probiotic bacterium @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ prevented the contraction of the syncytial virus, which is a respiratory virus. Ingesting Bifidobacterium lactis enhanced cellular immunity in an elderly cohort study. The probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis were shown to assist ventilated @di$ pneumonia @/di$ patients in clinical trials.	2
In natural hosts, brucellosis is most commonly associated with reproductive losses and infertility, but can also cause @di$ arthritis @/di$, mastitis, and other pathologic lesions. @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, B. suis, and B. abortus are the most important zoonotic species within the Brucella genus with @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ having the greatest virulence in humans. Although most Brucella species have the ability to infect a number of hosts, each has a preferred animal host. Goat and sheep are the preferred host for @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$.	1
In our study, the SCFAs-producing salutary commensal bacteria were dramatically reduced in RPs, including Eubacterium_hallii_group, @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Coprococcus, and Eubacterium_ventriosum_group. SCFAs, as paramount microbiota metabolites of the intestine lumen, play an important role in the modulation of the immune system not only for the intestine but also for distal sites or organs, including influencing pulmonary diseases or psychiatric illness through the gut-lung axis or gut-brain axis. Many studies have demonstrated that SCFAs are involved in the @di$ lung inflammation @/di$ of influenza, bacterial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. It was reported that SCFAs enhanced antiviral CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to protect against respiratory infection. Tian et al. demonstrated that increased production of propionate is associated with reduced @di$ lung inflammation @/di$ through animal experiments.	2
In part, confusion has been caused by failure to distinguish between two main sub-types of the syndrome: extrinsic, diarrhoea-associated HUS (D+ HUS), usually caused by infection with verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli or @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$, and the heterogeneous group of non-prodromal forms where intrinsic factors predominate (@di$ D- @/di$ HUS).	1
In practical applications, a rapid and reliable start-up method is required to efficiently enrich suitable populations in reactors and establish @di$ AD @/di$ systems with stable performance. Heat shock treatment of mixed inoculum is often used to accelerate enrichment of spore-forming H2-producing bacteria and to inhibit methanogens. This treatment is ineffective for enrichment of non-spore-forming H2-producing bacteria (such as @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$). Low pH is beneficial for establishing ethanol-type fermentation and suppressing butyrate or propionate fermentation types and methanogenesis. @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ is the representative hydrogen-producing genus of ethanol-type fermentation, which is often predominant population in continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors operated at low pH values (4.0-4.5). Assessment of the influence of pH on the metabolic regulation of @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ can help us better understand its functions in acidogenesis and provide more information to target an optimal pH value of reactor operations to yield the best possible performance of ethanol-type fermentation. In actual operations of anaerobic reactors, start-up conditions with low initial pH values lead to a long enrichment time of ethanol fermentation bacteria. Here, we proposed a strategy of screening ethanol fermentation bacteria by switching pH to achieve both bacterial bio-enhancement and fast start-up of anaerobic reactors. Microorganisms working in this hypothetical hydrogen-producing reactor may aggregate to form granular sludge. This effect may rely on the autoaggregation ability of @gm$ Ethanoligenens @/gm$ or how these bacteria form biofilms by biological immobilization of fillers.	0
In recent past, the @di$ respiratory infection @/di$ has emerged as a great challenge to the poultry farmers. Various pathogens including Avian pneumovirus (APV), Avian influenza virus (AIV), Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Avibacterium paragallinarum, @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (@gm$ ORT @/gm$), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are involved in the respiratory disease complex in birds (Bradbury, 1984; Roussan et al., 2008). Hence, respiratory disease complex is the most serious disease affecting to poultry and causes heavy economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide (Murthy et al., 2008). In recent years, metagenomics is powerful analyzing tool for detection of pathogens directly from clinical samples without any prior knowledge of the organism in a given sample (Schuster, 2008; Pereira et al., 2010). High throughput Next-Generation-Sequencing technology was used for sequencing the isolated genomic DNA. These data provides an insight about taxonomic and functional status of microorganisms responsible for causing @di$ respiratory infection @/di$ in broiler.	1
In relation to the microbiota, it has been established that the vaginal microbiota is relatively simple, i.e., in most cases it is dominated by a single @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. (Ravel et al.,; Gajer et al.,), and exists in a number of CST classified by dominance of one of four @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp., or by a mixed anaerobic population that might indicate dormant or active infection such as BV or @di$ aerobic vaginitis @/di$ (Donders,; Vieira-Baptista et al.,). As observed in other studies (Verhelst et al.,; Verstraelen et al.,; Lamont et al.,; Ravel et al.,; Gajer et al.,; Petricevic et al.,; McMillan et al.,), the samples from our study population fell into the described CSTs, with the highest abundance of CSTIII (L. iners, 41.14%) and CSTI (@gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$, 29.75%).	2
In special bacteriological stool cultures, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni were identified, whereas @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ was a rarer finding. The typical sonographic manifestation of bacterial ileocaecitis compared against Crohn's disease of the ileocaecal region is described. These two diseases can be differentiated against each other by means of sonography; likewise, it is also possible to distinguish them from appendicitis. Since stool cultures--which are not always prepared if @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ is only mild or completely absent--are received relatively late in acute cases, knowledge of the sonographic manifestation of bacterial ileo caecitis can help save many an unnecessary laparotomy.	1
In summary, UUO results in distinctive changes in colonic microbiota composition and plasma metabolites that can contribute to @di$ TIF @/di$. Ten plasma metabolites linked with @di$ TIF @/di$ were correlated with nine specific genera. Interestingly, plasma tryptophan levels were positively correlated with Clostridium IV, Turicibacter, Pseudomonas, and Lactobacillales, and negatively correlated with @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, Blautia, and Intestinimonas, which possess genes encoding tryptophan synthase, IDO, and TDO and their corresponding enzymes that exacerbate @di$ TIF @/di$. The restoration of the disrupted intestinal barrier by improving plasma metabolite dysregulation could retard @di$ TIF @/di$ by inhibiting tryptophan-derived metabolite-induced inflammation and oxidative stress by ergone and PU treatment. A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome and plasma metabolites in kidney function may shed new light on the pathogenesis of renal diseases and help in the designing of novel interventions aimed at restoring symbiosis to treat or prevent @di$ renal fibrosis @/di$.	1
In summary, we report a case of co-infection of Rickettsia burneti and @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$. The patient was hospitalized for fracture, and developed high @di$ fever @/di$ three days after admission, with no any other obvious discomfort. Laboratory examination showed that PCT and CRP were elevated, and there was no any other obvious abnormality. Through IFA and mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the patient was infected with Rickettsia burneti and @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$.	1
In the other four, @di$ heart failure @/di$, uremia, and coagulopathy complicated the findings. In one patient, P carinii was the cause; in one @di$ congestive heart failure @/di$, which was not obvious clinically or radiologically, was the cause. Three patients died: one of uncomplicated pulmonary hemorrhage, one with pulmonary hemorrhage occurring during the treatment of pneumonia due to @gm$ L bozemanii @/gm$, and one with pulmonary hemorrhage and multiple complications including sepsis due to Candida.	1
In this STRATAA surveillance study, S @gm$ Typhi @/gm$ was the primary cause of bacterial bloodstream infection in people with @di$ fever @/di$ across three different epidemiological contexts in Africa and Asia. Crude incidence of blood-culture-confirmed disease identified through passive surveillance were adjusted to estimate the incidence of typhoid fever occurring within the census populations using parameters measured from within the populations, indicating that true rates are likely to be considerably higher than those estimated directly by blood culture. Seroincidence data indicate that exposure to S @gm$ Typhi @/gm$ might be even higher, suggesting substantial numbers of subclinical episodes, which might make an important contribution to transmission in the population.	1
In this present study, we observed different distributions of species from family Lachnospiraceae in both groups, among which @gm$ A. caccae @/gm$ and E. hallii predominated in @di$ AD @/di$ individuals, with R. intestinalis in controls (8.22 x 10-4 vs. 1.18 x 10-5; 0.28% vs. 0.08%; 0.30% vs. 0.95%). All these microbes were involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs, the major products from the fermentation activity of gut microbes, are proved to play a crucial role in host health. They could promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells and the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, avoiding colonic inflammation and cancer development, as well as modulate host energy metabolism. Additionally, it became increasingly accepted that SCFAs could mediate epigenetic modification, which was negatively associated with allergic sensitization and events. Reddel et al. showed that @di$ AD @/di$ children were characterized as a reduction of SCFA-producing bacteria. Moreover, the severity of @di$ atopic eczema @/di$ was inversely correlated with the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (r = -0.52, P = 0.005). Meanwhile, in an ovalbumin-induced mouse model of @di$ AD @/di$, the use of antibiotics before primary ovalbumin sensitization would reduce gut SCFA levels and aggravate @di$ AD @/di$ symptoms mediated by gut dysbiosis.	1
In this study, @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was detected significantly more often in @di$ TD @/di$ stool samples from Nepal as compared to asymptomatic controls. These stools samples were previously categorized as pathogen-negative after undergoing a comprehensive laboratory workup for enteric bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the present study, 92.3% of the @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ cases were from Nepal. Similarly, 80% of the C. ureolyticus cases were from Nepal though there were only five total cases of C. ureolyticus detected. There are no previous published data on the prevalence of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and C. ureolyticus from the CIWEC Travel Medicine Clinic, Kathmandu, Nepal and at Bamrungrad International Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand as these microorganisms are not routinely tested for in the clinical laboratories at these facilities. In a previous @di$ TD @/di$ case-control study conducted at the CIWEC Travel Medicine Clinic from 2001 to 2003, Campylobacter was the most prevalent pathogen detected in cases (17%), but the Campylobacter isolates were not speciated in this study. Multiple studies have also shown that Campylobacter spp. is the most common pathogen in Thailand to cause acute gastroenteritis in travelers, deployed US military personnel and the indigenous population. Similar to cases from CIWEC, C. jejuni was the most common detected pathogen from cases at Bamrungrad International Hospital. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing detection of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and C. ureolyticus in @di$ TD @/di$ samples in a case-control setting from Nepal and Thailand and that these results strongly suggest a potential role of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in the development of @di$ TD @/di$ in travelers to Nepal.	1
In this study, different concentrations of matrine were given to mice with DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ for a week. The symptoms of @di$ colitis @/di$, colonic pathology, inflammation-related indicators, and intestinal mucosal barrier function were detected and analyzed. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis in colon tissues was conducted, and 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to evaluate the gut microbiota of colon contents. The results showed that matrine significantly alleviated clinical activity and histological changes of UC mice, inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, and improved gut barrier integrity. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis and experimental verification showed that matrine significantly inhibited the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) signaling pathway. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that matrine altered the composition and functions of gut microbiota, increased the abundance of @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ and decreased the abundance of Helicobacter ganmani at the species level. In conclusion, matrine ameliorated DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ by improving gut barrier integrity, inhibiting the PPAR-alpha signaling pathway, and modulating gut microbiota.	2
In this study, we demonstrated that Nfkbiz-deficient (Nfkbiz -/-) mice with @di$ atopic-like dermatitis @/di$ have elevated serum IgE Abs and drastically increased numbers of IL-17A-secreting CD4+ T cells in skin. Microbiome analysis showed the predominant expansion of Staphylococcus sequences, particularly @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$, and a significant decrease in the diversity of commensal bacteria. Antibiotics completely eliminated dermatitis symptoms, implying specific taxonomic alterations associated with the induction of hyper-immune responses in the skin. Of note, the inoculation of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ in the skin of Nfkbiz -/- and their heterozygous littermates (Nfkbiz +/-) resulted in the expansion of IL-17A production from CD4+ T cells.	1
In this study, we report an association between lower levels of @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ and obesity for the first time. Five studies reported a decreased number of Bifidobacterium representatives in the feces of obese subjects at the genus level. At the species level, Kalliomaki et al. using a Bifidobacterium species-specific PCR, found that Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium breve were higher in normal @di$ weight @/di$ controls, but this result was not significant probably because of a small sample size. Experimental data report that administration of a B. breve strain to mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity led to a significant @di$ weight @/di$ decrease. Administering four different Bifidobacterium strains to high-fat diet induced obese rats, Yin et al. reported that one strain increased body @di$ weight @/di$ gain, another induced a decrease and the two other strains lead to no significant change in body @di$ weight @/di$ but species were not mentioned in this study.	2
In this work, we identified a significant impact of dosing volume on the development of pneumonic or septicemic plague as the likely cause of death following intranasal challenge of mice with wild type @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$. These data have important implications on plague research and the early testing of candidates for new vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Retention in the upper respiratory tract that results from low volume intranasal instillation leads to a high frequency of secondary septicemic plague, with multi-organ failure as evidenced by severe hepatocyte necrosis and elevation of cytokines and liver enzymes in the serum in mice as they succumb to @di$ infection @/di$.	1
"Indeed, @di$ UHT @/di$ milk can undergo irreversible gelation upon the enzymatic degradation of bovine milk protein, especially casein (CN). For instance, the endogenous proteolytic ""plasmin system"" (plasmin/plasminogen and related activators/inhibitors) has been linked to the gelation of UHT milk. This system has a certain thermal stability and its residual activity in @di$ UHT @/di$ milk is a function of the severity of the thermal load. For this reason, proteolysis by plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) is reported to occur most often in direct UHT milk, and less often in the indirect-heated type, and to sequentially hydrolyze beta-CN followed by alphaS1- and alphaS2-CN. Another potential causative factor of gelation is the action of proteases produced by psychrotrophic bacteria during the refrigerated storage of raw milk to be heat-treated. Despite psychrotrophs being destroyed by (direct or indirect) UHT treatment, their extracellular proteases can continue their activities and cause UHT milk gelation after weeks/months of storage. Contrarily, most of these extracellular thermostable proteases are inactivated by in-bottle sterilization, which gives the final sterilized milk a longer shelf life. Scientific and technological interest has been especially focused on extracellular alkaline metalloprotease AprX as a marker for psychrotrophs' milk contamination and consequently, as a potential risk for @di$ UHT @/di$ milk spoilage. The aprX gene is present in several genera other than @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$, including Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Hafnia. Moreover, it has been reported that the AprX-induced gelation of UHT milk is mainly caused by the hydrolysis of kappa-CN to produce ""para-kappa-casein-like"" peptides. This mechanism also has been pointed out for other exogenous caseinolytic enzymes. Among psychrotrophic bacteria, @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ spp."	1
Indeed, our previous and present data show that @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ correlated with A. muciniphila. Moreover, both A. muciniphila and @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ are highly increased upon metformin treatment or upon prebiotic treatment. In this study, we found that administration of S. variabile did not result in a subsequent increase of A. muciniphila abundance. Another potential explanation would be that @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ variabile is, in fact, not a determinant in @di$ obesity @/di$ and that its correlation with improved metabolic parameters relies either on mere coincidence or on its inclination to thrive in a healthier microbial community. In other words, one may argue that @gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ is not a major bacterium acting on health but is rather an opportunistic bacterium growing either thanks to the presence of undigested compounds (e.g., fibers) or specific drugs (e.g., metformin, acarbose).	0
Infections caused by enterococci include endocarditis, @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Among many species identified, @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ and E. faecium are the most common species capable of causing infection and posing a threat of antimicrobial resistance, with @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ accounting for the majority of infections.	1
Inflammatory factors like IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-a or microorganisms biomarkers @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$, K. oxytoca, and E. cloacae need further research for indicating infection and constructing @di$ UTI @/di$ diagnostic model of patients with CU.	0
Interestingly, amoxicillin-treated HFD mice showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, Coprococcus, Sutterella, Bacteroides and, Akkermansia as compared to mice receiving HFD, and CD diets. However, amoxicillin treatment in CD-fed mice caused a significant decrease in the relative abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ and Coprococcus (p < 0.0001), and a significant increase in Akkermansia (p < 0.0001) compared to the CD-fed mice. In our study, we also observed a substantial increase in Bacteroides acidifaciens, Bacteroides uniformis, and Akkermansia muciniphila (p < 0.0001) in amoxicillin- treated HFD-fed mice compared to HFD-fed mice only. Likewise, amoxicillin treatment in CD-fed mice also increased the abundance of Bacteroides acidifaciens and Akkermansia muciniphila (p < 0.0001) compared to the mice receiving only CD. Importantly, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ has a negative correlation with the fasting plasma glucose levels and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels . Further, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ also plays an important role in repressing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. Similarly, Coprococcus is shown to negatively correlate with hypertension, body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. Bacteroides acidifaciens and Bacteroides uniformis induce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) activation by using the G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) through bile acids, taurine, and cholate that counters @di$ obesity @/di$ and increases insulin sensitivity in mice.	2
Intestinal spirochaetosis is a human colonic infection due to Brachyspira aalborgi and @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ causing various @di$ abdominal complaints @/di$. Although the presence of healthy epithelial cells was hypothesized to be essential for the adhesion of spirochaetes to the colonic mucosa, their adhesion to hyperplastic and adenomatous colonic polyps has been observed recently. We report a case of a woman with long-standing @di$ abdominal symptoms @/di$, in whom spirochaetes were found on the colonic mucosa surrounding an adenocarcinoma in the biopsies collected during eight years of follow-up. Spirochaetes were found attached to normal mucosa, to hyperplastic and to adenomatous polyps, but not to the epithelium of the carcinoma. The rectal biopsy collected during the last follow-up colonoscopy was subjected to histopathology and to a specific examination for brachyspires, demonstrating the presence of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ DNA. This report could stimulate microbiological investigations during the follow-up of colonic polyps in order to explain whether the persistence of @di$ abdominal symptoms @/di$ in such patients could be caused by a colonic spirochaetosis susceptible to eradication by a targeted therapy.	1
Intriguingly, even though some research groups have reported increases in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species as part of the @di$ gut dysbiosis @/di$ seen in patients with MS, probiotic supplementation with the species has been recommended as a potential therapeutic for MS because @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ produces gamma-aminobutiric acid, folate, conjugated linoleic acids, and other metabolites capable of impacting the immune system and the CNS.	2
Intriguingly, one archaeal species (@gm$ MSS @/gm$) also led to eosinophilic inflammation. In view that eosinophilic inflammation is usually associated with the development of asthma and that archaeal species induce a strong T cell response, it is tempting to speculate that archaeal species might be linked to the development of exposure-related @di$ airway diseases @/di$ including HP and occupational asthma. Moreover, our study reveals that not only the nature, but also the dose of the inhaled agent could determine the nature of an exposure-related respiratory disease, with increasing doses of @gm$ MSS @/gm$ leading to a downregulation of eosinophil accumulation in the airways. Mechanisms of eosinophilic inflammation downregulation by increasing doses of @gm$ MSS @/gm$ are currently being investigated.	1
It causes bacteremia, urinary tract infection, pleuritis, empyema, peritonitis, keratitis, @di$ bloodstream infection @/di$, nephrotic syndrome, post-traumatic abscess, Leg ulcer, and pyogenic liver abscesses and is typically resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials. Delftia tsuruhatensis is a gram-negative bacillus discovered in Japan in 2003. These bacteria cause bacteremia, catheter-related infection, respiratory infection in a premature infant, and are resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Achromobacter xylosoxidans, formerly known as Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. xylosoxidans, is a gram-negative bacillus that is intrinsically resistant to most antibiotics and was first found in the purulent ear drainage of patients with chronic otitis media. It was later identified as an etiologic agent of meningitis, pneumonia, surgical wound infections, bacteremia, @di$ septicemia @/di$, urinary tract infections, peritonitis, pharyngitis, etiologic agent, and endocarditis. Patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with non-cystic fibrosis (patients with bronchiectasis and patients with cancer) are at risk of infection with Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and there is evidence of patient-to-patient transmission. @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ is a major pathogen of brucellosis in goats and sheep and is the most common pathogen in human brucellosis. In animals, Brucella infection has a negative impact on fetal development and reproductive organs, leading to reproductive failure, abortions, and infertility. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Office International des Epizootics consider brucellosis to be one of the world's most serious neglected zoonotic diseases. Ticks are reservoir vectors for brucellosis and genes specific to the Brucella genus have been found in developmental stages and anatomical regions of ticks. @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ was isolated from eggs and engorged adults of D.	0
It has been shown that the bacterial degradation of oxalate is carried by @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ in the human intestinal tract and the absence of @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ is considered a risk factor for urolithiasis. Similarly Choline, an essential dietary nutrient, is found to be metabolized in the liver by the gut microbial enzymes. Thus conversion of dietary choline is used as a metabolic hallmark for liver and cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, nitrate reductase that converts nitrate into nitrite and nitric oxide, is synthesized only by gut microbiome; elevated levels of nitric oxide have been associated with both IBD and obesity-induced @di$ insulin resistance @/di$.	1
It may be speculative whether the presence of multiple proteases might help @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species to colonize/infect a variety of different hosts. However, there appears to be a tendency that @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species possessing both Cj1365c and Cj1417c (e.g., C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, C. fetus) are capable of colonizing multiple hosts, including hosts as different as mammals and birds or hosts as different as mammals and reptiles (Figure 3). Yet, there are exceptions; some species that possess both proteases are currently known to colonize only a single particular host, such as C. vulpis or C. armoricus. In addition, we need to keep in mind that not all @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species colonize the lower digestive tract, some were isolated from the oral cavity. In general, our knowledge of bacterial proteases and their importance in pathogenic processes is still limited, including whether proteases play a role in the development of specific diseases such as RA, GBS, MFS or @di$ IBD @/di$.	1
It was found that @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) decreased the expression of miR-200c in gingival epithelial cells and gingival tissues in obese mice with periodontitis. However, another study showed that miR-200b was significantly elevated in the gingiva of obese periodontitis subjects using qRT-PCR. miR-200b was also reported to be overexpressed in a Japanese population with chronic periodontitis. Altogether, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c may exert different functions under @di$ inflammatory @/di$ conditions.	1
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of @di$ nosocomial and community acquired infections @/di$ especially in immunocompromised patients. K. pneumoniae is categorised into three phylogenetic groups: KpI, KpII and KpIII. KpI comprises of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis and K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae. Recently, KpII has been designated as K. quasipneumoniae and was further classified into KpIIa which is K. quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae and KpIIb which is K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae. The KpIII group comprises of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$.	1
"L2_50, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium hallii, @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Peptostreptococcaceae noname unclassified, Prevotella copri, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus champanellensis, Ruminococcus obeum, and Sutterella wadsworthensis. In this list, at least one bacterium regarded as ""unfriendly"" can be found: O. splanchnicus, which has been isolated from the crevicular spaces of dogs with @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (Hardham et al.,). However, many more species regarded as beneficial were found in the healthy subjects compared with the migraineurs. B. clarus is significantly decreased in colorectal cancer (Watanabe et al.,; Liang et al.,), and its enrichment in controls may be beneficial. S. wadsworthensis protects against IBD (Wexler et al.,); C. catus ferments fructose, lactate, and pyruvate to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Holdeman and Moore,); E. hallii contributes to the intestinal propionate formation (Engels et al.,) and improves insulin sensitivity (Udayappan et al.,); @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ produces propionic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Schneider and Blaut,; Braune et al.,); R."	0
"L2_50, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium hallii, Eubacterium ramulus, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, Peptostreptococcaceae noname unclassified, Prevotella copri, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus champanellensis, Ruminococcus obeum, and Sutterella wadsworthensis. In this list, at least one bacterium regarded as ""unfriendly"" can be found: @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, which has been isolated from the crevicular spaces of dogs with @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (Hardham et al.,)."	1
Lactobacilli, which mainly belong to the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract, only marginally colonize the nasopharyngeal microbiome and have largely proven ineffective in preventing @di$ AOM @/di$. A previous randomized clinical trial (RCT) found that an in-house alpha-streptococcal spray administered nasally after antimicrobial therapy for @di$ AOM @/di$ protected children from recurrent @di$ AOM @/di$. However, in-house bacterial sprays have not been evaluated for safety and may vary in effectiveness. Recently, commercially available probiotic products containing @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ strains, successful colonizers of the human oral cavity and nasopharynx, have been developed for oral health care. Sarlin et al have previously shown in an RCT that commercially available S salivarius K12 oral products may reduce the relative abundance of otopathogens in the nasopharyngeal microbiome while maintaining its diversity. We hypothesized that S salivarius K12 oral products may be effective in preventing @di$ AOM @/di$. In this placebo-controlled RCT, we investigated the clinical efficacy of commercially available streptococcal strain S salivarius K12 oral probiotic products in the primary prevention of @di$ AOM @/di$ among children attending day care.	2
Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ are the most frequently utilised probiotic microorganisms. We investigated the feasibility of employing such species in endodontic therapy to promote bacteriotherapy. Initial illnesses of the decaying dental pulp usually have a mixed flora, with anaerobic type Gram-negative bacteria predominance. Conversely, anaerobic type Gram-positive bacterial species like E. faecalis and C. albicans yeast are more common in chronic infection. C. albicans is the most commonly detected yeast from root obturated teeth with @di$ periodontitis @/di$ in the area around the root apex due to its biphasic character, which permits it as being the ubiquitous co-agglomerate in biofilms.	0
Like other Gram-negative bacilli, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species are non-spore-forming, non-motile, singular cells that thrive under anaerobic growth conditions. Therefore, their isolation from the patient's BCs:the today's laboratory diagnostic standard for BSI:is somewhat difficult because of prolonged organism's growth times that often exceed the conventional 5-day incubation BC period. Our patient presented with fever (> 38  C) which represents a typical symptom of bacteremia. By reviewing studies that evaluated aged (65 years and older) patients hospitalized with BSIs, Yahav et al. reported that the fever was present in at least 75%, whereas @di$ leukocytosis @/di$ in 39-73% and leukopenia in ~ 10%, of the patients studied. In one of these studies, elevation of CRP was as common in older patients as in younger patients. In our patient, increased levels of either WBC (twofold) or CRP (fivefold) occurred immediately prior to the BSI onset. This strengthens the pathogenicity of the @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ isolate and, importantly, counterbalances the fact we were unable to recover the isolate from more than one blood sample of our patient, which is often the case in many instances. Consistent with the fact that anaerobic bacteria including @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species are slow and/or fastidious growing on standard subculture media, we could not obtain reliable identification of the patient's isolate with the MALDI BioTyper  system, which is a well-suited method in routine laboratories. As anaerobic Gram-negative isolates can be resistant to penicillin, a combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin may be appropriate in cases of infection caused by B. fragilis group, Fusobacterium species, or pigmented @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ species.	1
Likewise, the efficacy of multi-strain commercial probiotic mix (@gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$, Clostridium butyricum, and L. plantarum) was tested against APEC 078 infection by supplementing in the broilers feed. There was significant decrease in mortality (13.6% to 0%) and APEC counts in liver and spleen and increase in growth performance and lactobacilli population in broilers fed with the probiotic mix. Another commercial probiotic mix (@gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$, L. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Saccharomyces pastorianus) was also tested in combination with recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV) for protection against APEC (O78:K80) and Salmonella infection by supplementing in feed in layer chickens. Chickens showed reduced signs of airsacculitis, perihepatitis, and @di$ pericarditis @/di$ and lower APEC load in the blood. These studies suggest that different probiotics belonging to genus Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, and Pediococcus show efficacy in preventing APEC infections as well as improve the growth performance, maintain the healthy intestinal microbiota, and enhance the intestinal mucosal immunity. Furthermore, there are multiple probiotic products (for example, Sav-A-Chick  Probiotic Poultry Supplement, Probios , HealthyGutTM PROBIOTICS, and SuperDFM- Poultry) commercially available for use in maintaining intestinal health and boosting immune status in poultry. These probiotics contain different beneficial microorganisms, such as @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$, B.	2
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period of 1-year, 63 typhoidal Salmonellae were isolated from 14,050 blood cultures and one parietal wall @di$ abscess @/di$. 36 (56.25%) were Salmonella Typhi and 27 (42%) were @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi A. @/gm$ They were all screened for resistance by the disc diffusion method and their minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using agar dilution, broth dilution and E-strip method. Ciprofloxacin resistant isolates were screened for PMQR determinants by polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: All the 63 isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. Among the 36 S. Typhi isolates 20 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, of which 14 carried the plasmid gene qnrB and one carried the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. qnrA and qnrS genes were not detected. Ciprofloxacin resistance was not seen in any of the @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ isolates.	1
METHODS: A study was performed during a 2-year period to determine the clinical manifestations in @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$-positive children with gastroenteritis. A case patient was defined as a child or teenager (<18 years) with a @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$-positive stool sample during the study period. Clinical data were obtained with use of a questionnaire study supplemented with the patients' medical records. The clinical manifestations in these patients were compared with those of patients with Campylobacter jejuni/coli infection. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred seventy-two diarrheic stool samples from 1867 children were cultured for pathogenic enteric bacteria during the study period, and 85 and 109 children with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and C. jejuni/coli, respectively, were identified. Comparison of the acute clinical manifestations in 44 @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ patients with those in 64 C. jejuni/coli patients showed a significantly lower prevalence of fever, chills and blood in stools in the former. However, half of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ patients compared with one-fourth of C. jejuni/coli patients had prolonged @di$ diarrhea @/di$ for more than 2 weeks and two-thirds of all children with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ reported loose stools after 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: C. concisus infection in children seems to have a milder course of acute gastroenteritis compared with C. jejuni/coli infection but is associated with more prolonged @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Children with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ have the same degree of late gastrointestinal complaints as children diagnosed with C.	1
METHODS: From September, 2016, to September, 2019, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance for @gm$ Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi @/gm$ (@gm$ S Typhi @/gm$) and Paratyphi (S Paratyphi) A, B, and C at health facilities in predetermined catchment areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients eligible for inclusion were outpatients with 3 or more consecutive days of @di$ fever @/di$ in the last 7 days; inpatients with suspected or confirmed enteric fever; patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever from the hospital laboratories not captured by inpatient or outpatient enrolment and cases from the laboratory network; and patients with non-traumatic ileal perforation under surgical care. We used a hybrid surveillance model, pairing facility-based blood culture surveillance with community surveys of health-care use. Blood cultures were performed for enrolled patients. We calculated overall and age-specific typhoid and paratyphoid incidence estimates for each study site. Adjusted estimates accounted for the sensitivity of blood culture, the proportion of eligible individuals who consented and provided blood, the probability of care-seeking at a study facility, and the influence of wealth and education on care-seeking. We additionally calculated incidence of hospitalisation due to typhoid and paratyphoid. FINDINGS: A total of 34 747 patients were enrolled across 23 facilitates (six tertiary hospitals, surgical wards of two additional hospitals, and 15 laboratory network sites) during the study period. Of the 34 303 blood cultures performed on enrolled patients, 8705 (26%) were positive for typhoidal Salmonella. Adjusted incidence rates of enteric fever considered patients in the six tertiary hospitals. Adjusted incidence of @gm$ S Typhi @/gm$, expressed per 100 000 person-years, was 913 (95% CI 765-1095) in Dhaka.	1
Macrolides have less marked immunosuppressive properties than corticosteroids, and effects include decreasing mucous production, inhibiting virulence factors and biofilm formation of @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$, decreasing leukocyte numbers and altering inflammatory mediator release. Macrolides have been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis, improve lung function and symptoms in asthma and CF, and reduce nasal polyps and secretions in @di$ sinusitis @/di$.	2
Members of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group are involved in the deterioration of a wide variety of foods through the production of pigment, enzymes and other molecules involved in @di$ organoleptic decay @/di$ (Andreani and Fasolato,). This spoilage potential has been reported in a large number of well-publicized cases of several food lots being withdrawn from the market, especially cheese (e.g. blue mozzarella), resulting in economic losses and alarming consumers (Nogarol et al.,; RASFF,). This abnormal blue discoloration has been investigated by several authors (Andreani et al.,; Caputo et al.,; Nogarol et al.,), but some peculiar aspects are still under debate. For instance, the chemical nature of the pigment is not well-defined, but recently matrix assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed that the blue pigment produced by colored @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ strains is probably an indigoderivative molecule (Andreani et al.,).	1
Metagenomic analysis of stool samples from patients with CRC revealed bacteria closely associated with the development of CRC, and these bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, Alistipes finegoldii, and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans. Molecular mechanisms that drive @di$ tumorigenesis @/di$ have been elucidated, including bacterial membrane proteins or secretory molecules that interact with human cancer cells.	1
Mice deficient in any one of the four Pglyrp genes are more sensitive to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, and stools from Pglyrp-deficient mice transferred to wild type (WT) germ-free mice predispose them to much more severe @di$ colitis @/di$ than stools from WT mice. However, the identities of these Pglyrp-regulated bacteria that predispose Pglyrp-deficient mice to @di$ colitis @/di$ or protect WT mice from @di$ colitis @/di$ are not known. Here we identified significant changes in beta-diversity of stool bacteria in Pglyrp-deficient mice compared with WT mice. The most consistent changes in microbiome in all Pglyrp-deficient mice were in Bacteroidales, from which we selected four species, two with increased abundance (Prevotella falsenii and @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$) and two with decreased abundance (Bacteroides eggerthii and Alistipes finegoldii). We then gavaged WT mice with stock type strains of these species to test the hypothesis that they predispose to or protect from DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$. P. falsenii, @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$, and B. eggerthii all enhanced DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ in both WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora. By contrast, A. finegoldii (which is the most abundant species in WT mice) attenuated DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ both in WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora, similar to the @di$ colitis @/di$ protective effect of the entire normal microflora. These results identify P. falsenii, @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$, and B. eggerthii as @di$ colitis @/di$-promoting species and A. finegoldii as @di$ colitis @/di$-protective species.	1
Mice infected with DeltarpoE1 had less @di$ spleen inflammation @/di$ in the chronic phase (>6 weeks post-infection) than mice infected with WT B. abortus. This reduced splenomegaly correlated with a  3 log decrease in the number of splenic bacteria and decreased immunohistochemical staining of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ antigen in fixed spleens. Host clearance of B. abortus DeltarpoE1 strongly correlated with increased @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-specific IgG production relative to WT-infected mice, providing evidence that the DeltarpoE1 strain elicits a more robust humoral response than WT. Mice immunized with a single dose of 5x104 colony forming units (CFU) of DeltarpoE1 were completely protected from a WT challenge at 9 weeks post-immunization, demonstrating that DeltarpoE1 is a live attenuated vaccine. Vaccinated mice had higher total IgG, IgG2a, @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-specific IgG, and IFN-y levels than aged-matched naive mice after WT challenge.	2
Microbiota from patients transplanted to @di$ renal injured @/di$ germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated rats induce higher production of serum uraemic toxins and aggravated renal fibrosis and oxidative stress more than microbiota from controls. Two of the species, Eggerthella lenta and Fusobacterium nucleatum, increase uraemic toxins production and promote renal disease development in a CKD rat model. A probiotic @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ decreases abundance of these species, reduces levels of toxins and the severity of the disease in rats.	2
Microscopical observations and lipid quantification data confirmed that @gm$ LSC @/gm$ treatment reduced adipocyte fat accumulation. Western blot was used to determine molecular mechanisms involved in @gm$ LSC @/gm$ treatment-induced fat reduction in adipocytes. Key transcriptional factors such as PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-alpha/beta, and SREBP-1c associated with differentiation were downregulated in adipocytes treated with @gm$ LSC @/gm$ on day 10 (Figure 3A). @gm$ LSC @/gm$ treatment also inhibited the expression of key lipogenesis-associated proteins such as FAS, ACC, and aP2. Other proteins related to @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ and insulin sensitivity such as resistin and adiponectin levels were also determined. Results showed that @gm$ LSC @/gm$ treatment decreased resistin but increased adiponectin expression in adipocytes compared to control (Figure 3A,B).	2
More notably, we found robust evidence supporting a modification effect of the specific species @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ on body weight response to PA; that is, individuals with a high abundance of @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ had a stronger association of PA with less weight gain and reduced levels of @di$ obesity @/di$-related plasma biomarkers, compared to those with a low abundance of @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$. We also observed that the microbial metabolic pathways of gluconeogenesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, palmitoleate biosynthesis, and folate transformations might associate with the modification effect of @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ when it is present.	2
More recently, a correlation between the clinical finding of @di$ pneumatosis intestinalis @/di$ and the presence of clostridial species (@gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ and Clostridium paraputrificum) has been proposed.	1
Moreover, it was reported that an @di$ intestinal malignancy @/di$ was among the risk factors of Clostridia. The archaeal species @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ was the unique signature for a patient with a recurrence CRC state.	0
Moreover, the analysis showed that the TET-R phenotype was associated with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ and to a lesser extent, with S. saprophyticus, while @di$ ERY-R @/di$ was associated with L.	0
Moreover, we demonstrated that oat consumption significantly increased the abundance of bacteria previously shown to protect against metabolic disease, @di$ obesity @/di$, and CHD, specifically, Akkermansia mucinophila and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, as well as other saccharolytic and butyrate producing members of the gut microbiota.	2
Moreover, we observed that ETP subjects exhibited a higher @di$ BMI loss @/di$ ratio than ETB subjects after CR. Consistently, two recent studies have also reported that overweight subjects with a high Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio had a greater weight loss than those with a low Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio, when receiving a 6-week whole grain-rich diet, or a 24-week energy-deficit diet (~500 kcal/day). Enterotypes, indeed, have been linked to long-term diet habits. Both Prevotella and Bacteroides have played pivotal roles in carbohydrate metabolism, while showing various fiber-utilizing capacity. The gut microbiota of ETB and ETP subjects, thus, might possibly ferment indigestible dietary fibers from the same diet into different levels and ratios of SCFA (acetate, propionate, and butyrate), which are considered to be energy sources for colonocytes. One possible explanation could be that ETB subjects of higher abundance of Bacteroides might have a higher efficiency in energy extraction from a low-calorie diet, to reduce weight loss. Additionally, we also built a microbiota-based model and showed that baseline abundances of seven species showed a high performance for prediction of CR-induced @di$ BMI loss @/di$. Although none of them were assigned to genera Prevotella and Bacteroides, a few studies have reported their alterations in obese mice or humans. In line with the higher @di$ BMI loss @/di$ in subjects with ETP, @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ was positively associated with @di$ BMI loss @/di$ and enriched in subjects with ETP, while C. bolteae and C. ramosum were inversely associated with @di$ BMI loss @/di$ and enriched in subjects with ETB.	2
Most of the @di$ AG @/di$ biomarkers explored in this study were enriched in @di$ AG @/di$, including Bacteroides, Actinomyces, and Peptostreptococcus for AG_N, and Actinomyces, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus for AG_P. As expected, some potential synergistic bacteria of Helicobacter promoted the development of AG_P (Figure 4C,D). These identified microbes are in agreement with previous studies and may develop into intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer without prevention. We identified Actinomyces as a biomarker for both AG_N and AG_P. Microbes are filamentous Gram-positive Bacillus that weaken the host immune system or decrease oxygen tension and are strongly associated with inflammation. Furthermore, AG_N-associated beneficial bacteria, Weissella and Bacteroides, produce bacteriocins to inhibit pathogens and ameliorate inflammation, which can be considered as a protective role for AG_N. Peptostreptococcus possessing lactic acid and Atopobium producing H2S are acid-forming bacteria that are not conducive to the balance of stomach acid and can be used as indicators of AG_N progression. However, the number of harmful bacteria was significantly increased in patients with AG_P. Streptococcus is widely regarded as an AG_P-associated bacterium, and species including Streptococcus mitis/oralis, S. pneumoniae, @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$, and S. salivarius are reportedly associated with @di$ AG @/di$ in H.	1
Mycobacterium fortuitum, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and M.abscessus are the important human pathogens of this group. They cause wound infections, disseminated cutaneous disease, pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis or @di$ bronchiectasis @/di$, bone and joint infections and keratitis. Infections due to these Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported. Post laparoscopic wound infections, mesh site infections and other surgical site infections due to M. fortuitum and @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ have been reported.	1
Next, to strengthen the potential link between @di$ cachexia @/di$ and microbiota, we demonstrated that @di$ cachexia @/di$ was associated with relatively high dNLR and LIPI indexes. Importantly, these scores had been known to be correlated with worse outcomes in multiple cohorts, but these were also recently associated with microbiota composition. According to a study by McCulloch et al., patients in the high NLR group had abundant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Intestinimonas massiliensis and @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$. This was the first study that explored the association between cancer cachexia and systemic inflammatory indexes in combination with a GM analysis. However, similar to the microbiota analysis, there were no differences in the baseline inflammatory indexes between the @di$ cachexia @/di$-reversible and @di$ cachexia @/di$-irreversible subgroups.	1
Ninety-six @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ isolates were tested for cytotoxin and hemolysin production. Sixty-six (69%) of the isolates were both cytotoxic and hemolytic, whereas the rest produced neither cytotoxin nor hemolysin. No evidence of a separate cytotonic activity could be found in any of the isolates. Cytotoxin activity correlated with enterotoxic activity. Of four cytotoxin-producing strains tested in the isolated rabbit ileal loop, three were definitely positive and one was borderline, whereas two nontoxigenic strains were negative. Cytotoxin activity appeared to be a stable property and could not be assoicated with any common identified plasmid; only 10 of 21 cytotoxin-producing strains could be shown to have any plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxin production correlated with a positive lysine decarboxylase phenotype (98%) or a positive Voges-Proskauer phenotype (94%), compared to 27% lysine decarboxylase-positive and 23% Voges-Proskauer-positive, cytotoxin-negative isolates (P less than 0.001 for both). In fecal samples, cytotoxin production correlated with diarrheal disease; of 40 diarrheal isolates, 32 (80%) were toxigenic compared to 9 (41%) of 22 nondiarrheal isolates (P = 0.004). It appears that @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ can be a cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and that this enteropathogenic potential is mediated by a cytotoxic enterotoxin.	1
Non-modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of infection include age, gender, race and chronic diseases such as @di$ obstructive pulmonary or kidney disease @/di$, coagulopathies and cirrhosis. Modifiable risk factors have been shown to prolong the length of hospital stay and add to both the complication and early revision rates. These factors include obesity, poor dentition, opioid use, smoking, diabetes, @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ colonization and HIV.	1
None of the tested species were significantly associated with increased levels of @di$ caries @/di$ measured by a combined @di$ carious @/di$ and filled tooth score. The cariogenic species S. mutans and S. sobrinus, showed modest increased levels with increased @di$ caries @/di$. The lack of significant associations with @di$ caries @/di$ was probably because most children had @di$ caries @/di$, and a comparison between @di$ caries @/di$ and @di$ caries @/di$-free children was not possible. Other potentially cariogenic species, L. casei and Bifidobacterium dentium were detected at lower levels than the @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ species. Species associations with @di$ caries @/di$ particularly for S.	1
Nonetheless, this is a landmark study as it shows that gut microbiota can protect against @di$ seizures @/di$. As such, it raises several important questions. First, how does A. muciniphila and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ alter GGT activity? Second, in @di$ epilepsy @/di$ models in which KD is not effective, are A. muciniphila and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ still protective? Third, what is the nature of the synergistic interaction between A. muciniphila and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$? Fourth, how does the decrease in peripheral amino acids directly lead to increased glutamate and GABA levels in the brain? Fifth, could a global reduction in GG amino acids have any unintended side effects, such as negatively altering major metabolic or neurological processes? Finally, by which mechanism does KD increase A. muciniphila and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$? Overall, these exciting findings expand our knowledge of the basic mechanisms by which KD protects against @di$ seizures @/di$ and offer the potential for new microbial-based therapeutic options for @di$ epilepsy @/di$ and related @di$ seizures disorders @/di$.	2
Notably, both SCFAs and the valerate-producing bacterium @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ (a low-abundant commensal isolated from human gut) substantially increased CTL-mediated anti-tumor immunity in vivo, which resulted in reduced tumor growth in experimental models of melanoma and @di$ pancreatic cancer @/di$.	2
Notably, the cardiac phenotype of Chagas disease was associated with fecal enrichment of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ and Bilophila, when compared to the other Chagas disease groups. Both @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ and Bilophila are bile-tolerant microorganisms associated with an animal-based diet in humans (David et al.,; Wan et al.,). @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ has previously been associated with other diseases, such as diabetes (Qin et al.,), colon cancer (Fenner et al.,), and @di$ gut inflammation @/di$ (Saulnier et al.,).	1
Notably, we found that HbA1c was a potential predictor of clinical outcomes following AMI, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ was positively correlated with HbA1c, and Phascolarctobacterium faecium was negatively correlated with HbA1c. These findings are similar to those obtained in @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ (@di$ DM @/di$) patients. Thus, we inferred that the Phascolarctobacterium faecium species was a favorable factor and the @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ was a detrimental factor in AMIDM.	1
Numerous studies have indicated that probiotics can be used for the treatment of @di$ gastric ulcers @/di$. The idea of using probiotics arose from the study conducted by Elliott et al in 1998. In a rat model of acetic acid-induced @di$ gastric ulcer @/di$, colonization of gram-negative bacteria occurred rapidly at the site of the ulcer and significantly impaired ulcer healing. However, colonization by gram-positive bacteria promoted ulcer healing. Notably, administration of the exogenous probiotic strain @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ accelerated ulcer healing.	2
OFC impact early life oral microbiota development in terms of increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae (@gm$ Citrobacter @/gm$, Enterobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella), Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter. Further, we could show that the involvement of intraoral and extraoral structures by clefting plays a major role presented by a mixture with skin microbiota in UCLP/BCLP neonates and a mixture with nasal microbiota in @di$ CPo @/di$ neonates.	0
Of 170 bacterial isolates, 88.2% were identified as Escherichia coli, 8.8% as @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$, and 3% as Bordetella avium. Fourteen serotypes of E. coli were identified among 66 typeable isolates and the remainder were untypeable. The most prevalent serotypes were O1, O8, and O78. The main serotype of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ was serotype A. Experimental inoculation of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ via intravenous, intratracheal, and intra-air sac routes resulted in growth retardation, thickening in the air sacs, arthritis, and @di$ liver necrosis @/di$. Reisolation of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ from the air sacs, liver, trachea, heart, and spleen at day 7 postinoculation confirmed its role. In vitro susceptibility testing revealed that E. coli isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and colistin, @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ to tetracyline, and B.	1
Of six survivors in the P4 group, five had disseminated infections as indicated by recovery of kanamycin and streptomycin resistant @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ from the liver and spleen. By contrast, KFV101 never led to a disseminated infection in the first two experiments. An additional seven mice were inoculated with a fivefold higher dose of KFV101 and dissemination was charted. Of five mice that were colonized in the lung at 24 h, four developed disseminated infections. Thus, the accessory toxins may contribute to @di$ septicemia @/di$ at lower dosages but they are not absolutely essential for dissemination.	1
One patient had hepatitis C, diabetes, and @di$ high blood pressure @/di$; the other had hepatitis C and a history of substance abuse. Second, linezolid treatment was continued for both patients despite development of neurologic signs/symptoms. At that time, in 2013, TB treatment was continued in the context of a highly resistant strain of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$, lack of an effective drug (e.g., delamanid) for treatment, and severe disease, despite daily in-patient monitoring.	0
Oral administration of a Ganoderma meroterpene derivative (GMD) ameliorates @di$ nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis @/di$ in the liver of fa/fa rats by reducing endotoxemia, enhancing lipid oxidation, decreasing de novo lipogenesis, and suppressing lipid export from the liver. An altered gut microbiota with an increase of butyrate and folate plays a causative role in the effects of GMD. The commensal bacteria @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides uniformis, which are enriched by GMD, are major contributors to the increased gut folate. Administration of live @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ reduces @di$ hepatic steatosis @/di$ and enhances the folate-mediated signaling pathways in mice. Knockout of the folate biosynthetic folp gene in @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ blocks its folate production and beneficial effects. This work confirms the therapeutic potential of GMD and @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ in alleviating @di$ nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis @/di$ and provides evidence for benefits of the gut Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway.	2
Oral delivery of plant cells producing human proinsulin in chloroplasts prevented the onset of type 1 diabetes in non-obese @di$ diabetic @/di$ mice. Oral immunization (ORV) of chloroplast-derived F1-V antigens without adjuvant conferred greater protection (88%) against 50-fold lethal dose of aerosolized plague (@gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$) than subcutaneous (SQV) immunization (33%).	2
Our multivariable analysis revealed that the presence of @di$ cachexia @/di$ at baseline was independently associated with poor PFS and OS. Moreover, we identified a subgroup of patients with baseline @di$ cachexia @/di$ who were able to gain weight and reverse their @di$ cachexia @/di$ status, and this was associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, GM profiling revealed unique bacterial clusters in the patients with and without @di$ cachexia @/di$. At the genus level, the patients without @di$ cachexia @/di$ were enriched with beneficial bacteria including @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$, Anaerostipes, and Blautia. This is one of the first studies to investigate the clinical significance of cancer cachexia in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI therapy, in conjunction with a biomarker analysis focused on the GM signature of @di$ cachexia @/di$ and the response to ICI therapy.	2
PD is a multifocal neuronal disease that is distinguished by tremors, slow movement, @di$ akinesia @/di$, muscular rigidity, gait, and difficulty in walking. Instead of these symptoms, PD patients suffer from constipation which is one of the causes of increased intestinal permeability and inflammation that is directly related to the microbiota community of the small intestine. Small intestinal bacterial outgrowth and helicobacter pylori infection has seen in diseased person that causes motor impairment and problem-related with stool. In most cases, patients suffer from increased mucosal permeability and endo-toxic exposure caused by Coliform bacteria. Comparably, some bacteria are reduced in feces such as Roseburia intestinalis, Roseburia hominis, @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$, and Blautia faecis dysregulate the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides and are also responsible for GABA deregulation.	1
PURPOSE: @di$ Uveitis @/di$ is a major visual impairment disease affecting parts or the entire uveal tract and occasionally the sclera, the cornea or the optic nerve. The disease is a major cause of ocular morbidity and blindness in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In this work we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR to detect the etiological agent from blood, plasma, vitreous and aqueous humor and compared with the diagnostic hypothesis. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (13 male) were studied and Real-time PCR method was used for the detection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ (TB) and Toxoplasma gondii (Toxo) in the aqueous humor as well as in the vitreous, blood and plasma. RESULTS: Our results showed the presence of Toxo, CMV, VZV or HSV-2 in 19.2% of aqueous humor samples, and in 30% of vitreous humor samples. In plasma and blood samples, only CMV was detected (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR was able to detect and to confirm diagnostic hypothesis in @di$ uveitis @/di$. Our data also confirms that vitreous humor is the best source for molecular diagnosis of @di$ infectious uveitis @/di$ but indicates aqueous humor samples that are easier to obtain may also be appropriate to be tested by Real-time PCR.	1
Periodontal disease is a complex @di$ infection @/di$ caused by the interaction between dental plaque and host immune response, leading to the loss of bone and periodontal tissues if it remains untreated. There are several bacterial etiologic factors, among which Agreggatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), @gm$ Bacteroides forsythus @/gm$ (@gm$ Bf @/gm$), Treponema denticola (Td), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) are the most important.	1
Periodontitis is an infectious bacterial inflammatory disease of the supporting tissue of the teeth, with @di$ gingival bleeding @/di$, bone resorption and, subsequently, tooth loss. It is caused by local inflammation supported by periodontal bacteria (e.g., P.g., F. n., and @gm$ T.d @/gm$.).	1
Pneumococcus bacteria can be responsible for septicemia, meningitis, and @di$ pneumonia @/di$; while @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ can cause septicemia, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and cholecystitis.	0
Previous studies have shown that the intestinal flora structure of livestock and poultry can be affected by @di$ EO @/di$, which can improve the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and reduce the relative abundance of harmful bacteria in general. The higher alpha diversity of cecal microbes in the @di$ EO @/di$ groups and the significant differences in gut microbiota composition were observed in this study. Besides, the beneficial bacterium, such as Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium, were improved in the @di$ EO @/di$ groups. The only known species of Faecalibacterium, a new generation of probiotics, are Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can produce butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids by fermentation of dietary fiber. Otherwise, in present study, the harmful bacterium was reduced in the @di$ EO @/di$ groups such as @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$. There are a variety of opportunistic pathogens in the genus @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, resistant to a variety of antibiotics, including beta-lactam and aminoglycosides, which can lead to endogenous infections. Bacteroides_thetaiotaomicron belongs to @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, which is an opportunistic pathogen that can promote the growth and virulence gene expression of pathogenic bacteria.	2
Prevotella_ruminicola (@gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$) plays an important role in the metabolism of proteins and peptides in the rumen. @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ has the greatest range and activity of dipeptidyl peptidases, which release dipeptides from the N-terminus of peptides and may be the main reason for the higher substrate N digestibility in S30 and S40 and also the strong positive correlation of this microbe with @di$ ND @/di$ (Figure 5B). A recent study showed that lower methane emissions and higher feed conversion efficiency were associated with a higher abundance of @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$, which was also validated from the results that substrates DMD and ND were increased in S30 and S40, while methane production requires subsequent experiments to verify. Furthermore, it was observed that the abundance of Fibrobacter_succinogenes (F. succinogenes), which is considered to be a key cellulolytic bacterium that promotes the metabolism of other microbiota members by degrading cellulose into soluble sugars and succinate, was up-regulated in S30 and S40. In spite of the weak peptidolytic activity, studies have reported that when @gm$ P. ruminicola @/gm$ was co-cultured with F.	1
Probiotic-based studies in healthy adults have shown a wide variety of findings, ranging from a lack of any significant change in the overall gut microbiota structure to increases in the taxa level of the fed bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genera or species levels, or even changes in other bacterial groups. The modulation of beneficial gut bacteria, whether by increases in Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, or other bacterial groups, seems to be desirable in order to achieve a good balance of the gut microbial communities at the expense of more harmful bacteria. Consequently, beneficial effects in some gastrointestinal functions related to the stability of gut microbiota can be observed, such as the regulation of the intestinal transit time, which in turn might give improvements in the occurrence of @di$ constipation @/di$ and intestinal symptoms, as well as in the gut immune system, protecting the host from infections, inflammatory processes, and other immune-related disorders. Thus, given the importance of these effects for health maintenance and disease prevention in healthy populations, coupled with the fact that commensal microbes are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as dietary changes, the consumption of yogurt and PFM products might be a key strategy by which to achieve a beneficial gut microbiota composition, which is even more important nowadays, as lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, physical activity) have progressively become more unhealthy worldwide. Therefore, we hypothesized that the consumption of PFM and yogurt is related to the taxa level of ingested bacteria in the gut microbiota of healthy adults. Thus, specifically, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the associations of PFM consumption with Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ levels, as well as yogurt consumption with Lactobacillus and Streptococcus levels in healthy adults.	2
Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills (QSW) contain more than 70 kinds of medicinal materials, which have the effects of anti-@di$ cerebral infarction @/di$, anti-convulsion, anti-dementia, and so on. It is a treasure of Tibetan medicine commonly used in the treatment of cerebral ischemia in Tibetan areas. In this study, we gave rats QSW (66.68 mg/kg) once by gavage in advance and then immediately established the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. After 24 hours of treatment, the neuroprotection, intestinal pathology, and gut microbiota were examined. The results showed that QSW could significantly reduce the neurobehavioral abnormalities and @di$ cerebral infarction @/di$ rate in MCAO rats. Furthermore, qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry results showed that QSW could effectively inhibit IL-6, IL-1beta, and other inflammatory factors so as to effectively reduce the inflammatory response of MCAO rats. Furthermore, QSW could improve intestinal integrity and reduce intestinal injury. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that QSW could significantly improve the gut microbiota disorder of MCAO rats. Specifically, at the phylum level, it can regulate the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota of rats with MCAO. At the genus level, it can adjust the abundance of Escherichia and Shigella. At the species level, it can adjust the abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus johnsonii @/gm$ and Lactobacillus reuteri.	2
Questionnaire data obtained from 47/48 volunteers indicated that 89.4% (42/47) reported eating local food and the most common clinical symptoms were @di$ nausea @/di$ and abdominal pain (51%; 24/47). Multiple bacterial species were identified from the 48 stool samples with diarrhea etiological agents being detected in 79% (38/48) of the samples distributed as follows: 43.8% (21/48) Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter species, 42% (20/48) diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, and 23% (11/48) Salmonella. Co-infections were detected in 46% (22/48) of the samples. All C. jejuni isolates were resistant to CIP and NA. One C. jejuni isolate exhibited resistance to both AZM and ERY. Lastly, an association between exposure to poultry and subsequent detection of the diarrhea-associated pathogens E. coli and @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ was significant (p < 0.05).	1
RESULTS: @di$ Overweight @/di$ participants gained more species and functional pathway diversity than normal BMI participants. Nineteen disease-associated species were suppressed in moderate-responders without gaining diversity, and in strong-responders with diversity gains along with health-associated species. All participants reported improved short-chain fatty acids production, insulin and gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling. Moreover, fullness correlated positively with Bacteroides eggerthii; energetic status with B. uniformis, B. longum, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$, and Eubacterium eligens; healthy status with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella CAG 5226, Roseburia hominis, and Roseburia sp. CAG 182; and overall response with E. eligens and Corprococcus eutactus. Fiber consumption was negatively associated with pathogenic species. CONCLUSION: Although the AWE diet was consumed for only five days a week, all participants, especially @di$ overweight @/di$ ones, experienced improved fullness, health status, energy and overall responses.	2
RESULTS: Out of the 52 having blood culture positive for @gm$ Salmonella Typhi @/gm$ 47 (90.4%) and Salmonella Paratyphi 5 (9.6%), 4 (7.7%) were sensitive to first-line (Non-resistant), 11 (21.2%) MDR and 37 (71.2%) patient were XDR. One case was resistant to azithromycin. Nausea, vomiting or, abdominal pain was present in 12 (23%), abdominal distension present in 9 (17.3%), abdominal tenderness in 8 (15.4%), @di$ hepatomegaly @/di$ in 10 (19.2%) and, splenomegaly in 22 (42.3%).There were ultrasound abnormalities in 58% of patients and GI complications in 19% of patients.	1
Recently it has been shown that coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) such as @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus and S. sciuri secrete a N-Acylhomoserine lactonase (AHL-lactonase, ahlS) that is able to degrade N-Acylhomoserine lactones in P. aeruginosa thus causing a decrease in PYO and elastase production. This leads us back to our earlier assumption that S. aureus is less protected from Pseudomonas, than many CNS species which have PYO and cyanide resistant terminal cytochrome oxidase. To survive the respiratory toxins S. aureus shifts, or mutates, to SCVs. Despite this disadvantage that S. aureus has over P. aeruginosa, it is amazing how persistently S. aureus can colonize lungs of @di$ CF @/di$ patients over a long period of time, alone or together with P. aeruginosa. In contrast to many free-living CNS, S. aureus may not have learned to defend itself adequately against Pseudomonas. Presumably, S. aureus did not need to do so, since the @di$ CF @/di$ lung is one of the very few habitats in which it encounters P.	1
Recently, the significant roles of some intestinal anaerobic commensal bacteria, such as @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$, F. prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Prevotella, have been illustrated in gut microbiota-host interaction. One important feature of these bacteria is the production of short-chain fatty acids, which have various functions, including the regulation of gut barrier integrity, regulation of metabolism, and inflammation. Thus, there is a correlation between the abundance of mentioned bacteria and @di$ obesity @/di$[,,-].	2
Recurrent @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$ (@di$ UTIs @/di$) caused by uropathogenic @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ (UPEC) are common and morbid infections with limited therapeutic options.	1
Reducing stocking densities may mitigate litter moisture, lower housing temperatures, and decrease @di$ infection @/di$ risk. However, lower stocking densities than industry standards did not show any significance in feed conversion, mortality, or BW. Winkler et al. found that litter moisture was highest around water lines at 40.7% in tandem with the increased prevalence of E. coli and @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ in the same locations.	1
Regarding the difference between the groups at species levels, in mature HM samples, @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ (p < 0.01) and Streptococcus sp. HS1503 (p < 0.05) were found to dominate in NS-T group comparing the CS-T, while Streptococcus sp. S4643 (p < 0.05) is dominant in CS-T group. Proteobacteria_uc, Leuconostoc sp. @di$ DORA_2 @/di$, Streptococcus australis, and Streptococcus equi is dominant in PT comparing the NS-T group (p < 0.05).	0
Responsiveness to sheep red blood cells (SRBC), an antigen requiring the collaboration of both thymus-dependent (T) and thymus-independent (B) lymphocytes was determined by a plaque-forming assay; antibody production to @gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$ antigen, a thymus-independent antigen was measured in an agglutination test. The results suggested that DMN exerted little or no effect on B lymphocytes in the anti-SRBC antibody response. This effect commenced immediately following the carcinogenic insult from 24 h, with a degree of @di$ depression @/di$ for the first 10 days equivalent to antilymphocyte globulin in terms of numbers of anti-SRBC antibody-forming cells. From 2 weeks there was gradual recovery with full restoration of normal responsiveness at 8 weeks. During the ensuing period of emergence of neoplastic foci in the kidney, and with the progression of such foci to tumors of macroscopic dimensions, there was no accompanying @di$ depression of @/di$ antibody response.	0
Risk factors for cutaneous atypical mycobacterial infection include (1) immunodepression due to HIV infection, @di$ lymphoma @/di$, leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy. Immunodepression is responsible for the emergence of cutaneous infections by a large variety of atypical mycobacterial species, particularly in industrialized countries. (2) The natural environment is directly responsible for the emergence of cutaneous infections but a small number of atypical mycobacterial species including @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ in Europe and North America, and M.	1
STx-producing @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ cause massive epidemics in developing countries whereas, in North America, food-borne STEC infections predominate. The annual incidence of STEC infections in the USA alone is >70,000. Individuals infected with STx-producing @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ or STEC initially develop gastrointestinal disease. In a subset of patients, systemic effects of the released toxins lead to life threatening sequelae, such as @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$. Importantly, while antibiotic therapy is effective for the treatment of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ infections, in patients with STEC infections, usage of at least some classes of antibiotics increases STx1 and STx2 production and enhances the likelihood of developing @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$.	1
Saccharomyces boulardii is another well-known probiotic that has been administered for the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains have been reported to ameliorate obesity and obesity-associated disorders in rodents.	2
Serine/glycine lipids were not detected in lipid extracts from @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Lipid 1256 was detected more frequently and at a significantly higher mean level in periodontitis tissue samples compared with healthy/@di$ gingivitis @/di$ tissue samples.	1
Seven children (5.3%) had invasive complications: 5 bacteraemia and 2 @di$ meningitis @/di$. Age below 6 months, fever > 38.0 degrees C, and dehydration on admission were significantly associated with invasive complications. The commonest serotypes isolated were S. enteritidis, @gm$ S. paratyphi B @/gm$, and S.	1
Several studies have shown that using probiotics in @di$ obesity @/di$ treatment can reduce bodyweight. However, such treatments are still restricted. @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$, an epiphytic bacterium, is widely used in a variety of biological applications. However, few studies have investigated the role of Leuconostoc spp. in adipocyte differentiation and its molecular mechanisms. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of cell-free metabolites of L. citreum (LSC) on adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The results showed that LSC treatment reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and expression levels of CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein-alpha & beta (C/EBP-alpha & beta), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), serum regulatory binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), resistin, pp38MAPK, and pErk 44/42. However, compared to control cells, adiponectin, an insulin sensitizer, was elevated in adipocytes treated with LSC. In addition, LSC treatment increased lipolysis by increasing pAMPK-alpha and suppressing FAS, ACC, and PPAR-gamma expression, similarly to the effects of AICAR, an AMPK agonist. In conclusion, @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ is a novel probiotic strain that can be used to treat @di$ obesity @/di$ and its associated metabolic disorders.	2
Several taxa were commonly detected in men with and without idiopathic @di$ urethritis @/di$, including Streptococcus mitis group (i.e., amplicon sequence variants [ASVs] matching S. mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus infantis), Corynebacterium, @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$, Veillonella, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Prevotella. Hierarchical clustering revealed no distinct clustering according to case status. However, Haemophilus influenzae was commonly present in men with idiopathic @di$ urethritis @/di$ (Fig. S1); 15 of 33 (45%) MSM with idiopathic @di$ urethritis @/di$ had H. influenzae detected compared to 10 of 63 (16%) MSW with idiopathic @di$ urethritis @/di$ (Fisher's exact test P = 0.003).	0
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) pathovar is associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea (BD) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a systemic illness defined by the clinical triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, @di$ thrombocytopenia @/di$ and acute renal failure. STEC strains are characterized by the production of the cytotoxins Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) or Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), which have a pivotal role in BD and HUS pathogenesis. Ruminants such as cattle are major reservoirs for pathogenic STEC and exposure to their fecal matter is considered the most frequent source of human illness. Contaminated food and water as well as contact with infected animals or people also represent potential sources of STEC. @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ is the predominant etiologic serotype of sporadic and outbreak-related BD and HUS illnesses worldwide.	1
Shigellosis is one of the major causes of morbidity in children with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in Iran, but reports about prevalence of Shigella serogroups and their phenotypic and genetic epidemiological features are limited. Furthermore, specific studies to investigate the relatedness between the @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ strains isolated from clinical cases in Iran have never been undertaken.	1
Similarity in the @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp. profiles between children obtained with the MeTRS data was determined using hierarchical clustering. Discriminant analyses were performed to identify specific members of the microbial species responsible for the variability observed in the PCA and clustering data based on the designated nominal parameter used (kebeles, presence/absence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, EED severity, and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ status). The percentage of stool samples clustering within their own group (confidence interval of 95%; CI 95%) was used to determine whether the designated nominal parameters explained the variability observed between stool samples. A Wilcoxon test was performed to identify rpm abundance differences for a given member of the microbial species based on a specific nominal parameter. Correlations between the MeTRS, EED severity, and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ data were performed using a multivariate analysis combined with Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. The co-occurrence of the @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp.	1
Since @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ was first described in 2009 (Morais et al.; Vos and Laureys), only several cases of clinical infections in humans have been reported and none of catheter-related infection. Morais et al. identified the case of an enteric fever-like syndrome caused by @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ in an 82-year-old patient with a history of arterial hypertension and degenerative arthropathy. The patient was treated with amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. At the same time, Vos and Laureys reported colic distension associated with an inflammatory syndrome in a 97-year-old woman. The patient had a giant renal cyst. The woman was not treated with antibiotics, but the inflammatory syndrome resolved on its own. The third patient was an infant with visceral heterotaxy (Mau and Ross). The child showed skin flushing, and the authors identified @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. In 2011, Solak et al. identified @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ in a 44-year-old woman with diabetic foot lesion and a history of diabetes mellitus, @di$ hypertension @/di$, hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease.	1
Since then, the @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ is a well-established etiologic agent of both community and hospital-acquired pneumonias. Currently, more than fifty species of the family Legionellaceae have been identified. Legionella pneumophila alone causes approximately 90% of human infections. Legionella micdadei and @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ dunoffi are the second and third most common species to cause LD in children, respectively. Risk factors for LD in children following exposure include immunocompromised status, especially, corticosteroid treatment and chronic pulmonary disease. In this report, we describe a case of a 13-month-old girl who was on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment for infantile spasms. She developed severe L pneumophila pneumonia that lead to @di$ respiratory failure @/di$, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.	1
Some resident bacteria were detected in the peripheral organs and bacteria isolated from the oral cavity, including @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, Eikenella corrodens, and Porphyromonas sp. (Karpinski,; Tanaka et al.; Crooks et al.), further confirming that the bacteria in @di$ chronic otitis media @/di$ may originate from adjacent organs (Khattak et al.).	1
Some scientists have also reported the possibility of bacteremia:@di$ endocarditis @/di$ due to the administration of probiotic strains. According to Ruas-Madiedo et al., some @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. demonstrate mucolytic activities and have genes that induce mucin degrading enzymes. However, the majority of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp., such as B.	1
Stool counts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, and Pseudoflavonifractor species also increased significantly over the course of the trial. The increase in F. prausnitzii is particularly noteworthy because multiple studies have found that stool levels of F. prausnitzii, which comprises about 5% of total stool microbiota in healthy individuals, are significantly lower in patients with IBS, IBD, and @di$ celiac disease @/di$.	2
Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) organisms were previously known as @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ or Streptococcus milleri-anginosus group. They are gram-positive cocci distinguished by their microaerophilic growth requirements, their formation of colonies <0.5 mm in diameter, and by the presence of a distinct caramel-like odor when cultured. SMG organisms are commensals of the oral cavity and of the gastrointestinal tract. SMG organisms are notorious causes of pyogenic, invasive infections, and have been found in head and neck abscesses, bacteremia with endocarditis, @di$ liver abscess @/di$, thoracic empyema, brain abscess, and spinal epidural abscess.	1
Stx2-producing @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$ was detected in the stools of eight patients. All patients showed neurological symptoms, such as headache (n = 3), cognitive defects (n = 10), aphasia (n = 1), paresis (n = 2), @di$ seizures @/di$ (n = 3) and coma (n = 1).	1
Subsequently, six strains of @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (@gm$ ORT @/gm$) and three strains of Streptococcus zooepidemicus were isolated from the various organs and identified using biochemical tests and PCR methods. The pathogenesis of embolization in chickens is poorly understood. The current experimental study confirmed that ORT infection alone could induce a significantly fatal @di$ hemorrhagic pneumonia @/di$ and high mortality in comparison with S. zooepidemicus infection. Moreover, co-infection of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ with S. zooepidemicus could induce even higher mortality, with severe bronchial obstruction, than that observed in chickens infected with S. zooepidemicus or @gm$ ORT @/gm$ alone. Therefore, the combination of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ and S. zooepidemicus may be associated with the outbreak of chicken bronchial embolization. Further investigation of the pathogenesis of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ and Streptococcus is urgently needed.	1
Substantial evidence links @di$ obesity @/di$ to IBD, but few studies on taxonomic and functional profiles of microbial-derived proteins in the @di$ obese @/di$ IBD patients based on fecal metaproteomic have been conducted. In this study, we found that the abundance of P. distasonis in UC with overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$ was greater than that of the patients without overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$. Some previous investigations have suggested that P. distasonis could serve as a potential probiotic to improve human and animal digestive health. R. bromii was also found to be more abundant in UC with overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$. As far back as a decade ago, Ze et al. proposed that R. bromii possessed excellent ability to degrade resistant starch particles in human colon. The effect of R. bromii as a probiotic was further confirmed in subsequent investigations. Interestingly, we also identified another important bacterial species that was highly abundant in the UC patients with overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$, that is, @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$. A higher bacterial abundance was observed in the completely healthy individuals than in those without overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$. @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ was first discovered and named by Fumiko et. al in 2009. Recently, an essential role has been ascribed to @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ in the maintenance of intestinal microflora balance and gastrointestinal health. Overall, we speculate that UC patients with overweight/@di$ obesity @/di$ have alterations of gut microbial compositions, especially elevations of some probiotics.	2
Swine and poultry-infecting intestinal spirochetes can induce severe @di$ colitis @/di$ and diarrhea in those animals, while species colonizing humans (the intestinal spirochetes  @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ and  Brachyspira aalborgi ) are usually thought to induce few or no symptoms. Our understanding of colonic spirochetosis (CS) has been hampered by the difficulty in working with these species. @gm$ Brachyspira @/gm$ are fastidious, slow-growing, anaerobic bacteria, hard to isolate and to grow in laboratory conditions.	1
Syphilis's causative organism (@gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$) has not developed resistance to first-line treatment with BPG, which is also indicated for secondary prophylaxis of @di$ rheumatic heart disease @/di$, primary treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and yaws.	0
TCM uses Huangbai to treat conditions such as cirrhosis, @di$ chronic hepatitis @/di$, and tuberculosis. In addition to treating these diseases, it also is used for diarrhea and detoxification. In vitro experiments have shown that Huangbai is effective against staphylococcus aureus, pneumococcal, diphtheria, streptococcus viridans, and @gm$ shigella dysenteriae @/gm$.	0
TJN-101, which is a lignan component isolated from schisandra fruits, inhibits hepatotoxic chemicals-induced @di$ liver injuries @/di$. In this study, effects of TJN-101 on immunologically induced @di$ liver injuries @/di$ were investigated in vivo and in vitro. When a small dose of lipopolysaccharide was injected into mice previously injected with heat-killed @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$, most of the animals died with acute hepatic failure which was produced by cytotoxic factors from activated adherent cells, and liver cells were injured by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADCC) reaction or activated macrophages in vitro. TJN-101 reduced the mortality of the mice with acute hepatic failure dose-dependently. Histologically, necrosis was suppressed by the treatment of TJN-101, but infiltration of non-specific inflammatory cells was not. TJN-101 inhibited the isolated liver cell injuries induced by ADCC reaction or activated macrophages in vitro. These results suggest that TJN-101 can be markedly protective against immunological @di$ liver injuries @/di$.	1
Taking the primary medication for treating @di$ Parkinson's disease @/di$:levodopa:as an example, it must enter the brain and be converted there by the human DME aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) to its active form:dopamine. However, the delivery of levodopa to blood-brain barrier is greatly restricted by its intestinal metabolisms of both human and gut microbiome. Particularly, the host intestinal AADC and gut microbes Enterococcus faecalis and @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ can convert levodopa into a different chemical before it reaches the brain, which causes unwanted side effects.	1
Tardive congenital lues with keratitis, @di$ deafness @/di$, and notched upper incisors were described by Hutchinson in 1863. Feeding remained difficult, as wet nursing transmitted syphilis to the nurse and other infants. Specialized institutions tried goat or donkey milk. A debate between contagionists assuming exclusively maternal infection and hereditists assuming germinal transmission by the father's sperm continued throughout the 19th century. Schaudinn and Hoffmann identified @gm$ Spirochaeta pallida @/gm$ in 1905.	1
The Gram-negative @di$ CF @/di$ pathogens were more prevalent in the lung microbiomes of PI than in those of PS patients. Conversely, the constituents of a healthy lung flora, i.e., Veillonella, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, and Streptococcus species were more common in PS than in PI lungs. These findings confirm the registry data based on culture-dependent diagnostics showing that the amount of CFTR activity is the key determinant for the microbial colonization of @di$ CF @/di$ lungs; i.e., PI patients carry CFTR mutation genotypes which confer null or minimal CFTR activity, whereas PS patients harbor CFTR genotypes which confer some residual CFTR activity, about 10 to 20% of wild type.	2
The administration of phenolphthalein in the @di$ constipated @/di$ mice led to great changes in these indexes to 0.9287, 7599.74, 1668.5, 5.32, and 94.31, respectively. For the @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$-treated groups, the application of different strains resulted in an increasing trend of the alpha diversity of the microbial community in the fecal microbiota. Specifically, although there was no significant difference in the Shannon indices of the seven groups, the chao1 and observed species indices of the mice treated with the bacteriocin-producing @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ CCFM28 strain were significantly higher than those of the other groups.	2
The adverse events observed in our study included diarrhea and @di$ abdominal pain @/di$. However, these were not serious adverse events. The safety of eradication therapy of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ with triple therapy containing vonoprazan fumarate for adolescents remains unclear; however, reports have shown no major problems in short-term evaluations.	1
The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ spp., and Faecalibacterium prausntizii in the GM of @di$ CF @/di$ and healthy subjects. We focused on species commonly claimed as targets for the design of novel probiotics. According to a targeted metagenomics analysis and functional prediction of related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, we propose potential probiotics species for @di$ CF @/di$ management.	2
The aim of this study was to investigate age-dependent changes in the major populations of the intestinal microbiome and their possible association with @di$ atherosclerotic @/di$ severity and death due to CHD. Furthermore, we studied whether such intestinal derived bacterial DNA can be found in coronary plaques, which could indicate the translocation of gut bacteria via the portal vein into circulation and further into coronary plaques. Six groups, namely Bacteroides spp. (Bacteroidetes), @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ spp.	1
The aim of this study was to investigate the preventive and therapeutic effect of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ on food allergy in mice. In our study, there were higher scores about @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and anaphylactic symptoms in the food allergy group as compared to the control group. Positive incidence of mice with @di$ allergic diarrhea @/di$ and anaphylactic symptoms was increased in the food allergy mice.	2
The alterations in the gut microbiome in our study complement our results from those of a previous report on microbiota dysbiosis in @di$ B-CS @/di$. This trend might be explained by a combination of major alterations in the gut environment that may support the growth of several microbes. Intestinal microbial composition and metabolites are closely associated with liver diseases. As probiotics, Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces could reduce liver pathological damage by reducing inflammatory factors and increasing energy metabolism. However, Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, and Prevotella were associated with the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, spotty liver disease, and liver inflammation. In the present study, we also showed that related probiotics are depleted in the gut microbiome of patients with @di$ B-CS @/di$, while the microbiota that could induce disease development increased. This further confirms that @di$ B-CS @/di$ is a hepatic vascular disease associated with dysregulation of the gut microenvironment and metabolism.	1
The band 2 in M group was identified as @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ with 99.21%. Band 6 was identified as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) with 98.01% in @di$ H @/di$ group.	0
The clostridia are anaerobic, spore-forming bacilli that cause a diverse array of toxin-mediated infections in humans, including botulism, @di$ tetanus @/di$, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ is an emerging pathogen associated with highly-lethal female reproductive tract infections, bacteremia, and soft tissue infections. The high mortality of @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ infections is associated with a stereotypical toxic shock syndrome. A recent study estimated that nearly 1 in 200 deaths in women of reproductive age were associated with clostridial toxic shock, due to @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ and/or the related C. perfringens. An increased number of severe @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ infections has been reported over then past decade, following childbirth and abortion. Gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ infections present major challenges to the development of better preventive and therapeutic strategies against this emerging problem.	1
The common symptoms of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ enteric infections include diarrhea (often bloody), fever, abdominal cramps, headache, @di$ nausea @/di$ and/or vomiting. In vulnerable populations, such as very young children, elderly or immunologically compromised patients, this illness can be mortal2. Furthermore, other gastrointestinal manifestations or severe life threatening extragastrointestinal complications may appear. Because most @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ enteric infections are self-limiting, antibiotic administration is usually not required.	1
The genera Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus, Providencia, and @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$, as well as the species from Citrobacter freundii complex, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Shewanella algae and Vagococcus fluvialis, found in this study, were already reported in bivalve mollusks (especially clams, mussels and oysters). These groups of bacteria, some of which are fish pathogens, are commonly found in aquatic environments. All these bacteria were already associated with human infections, such as ear and eye infections, @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, infective arthritis, endocarditis, bacteremia, meningitis, intestinal and urinary tract infections, brain abscess, peritonitis, enteritis and septicemia, and some are recognized as important agents in nosocomial infections.	1

The genus @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ was the most common archaea, of which @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$ was identified in 14% of the samples (0.05% and 103 copies per milliliter of sample). Interestingly, a maximum of 105 copies were identified in a patient with an immune system condition (@di$ lymphoid leukemia @/di$). @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ is linked in the co-occurrence network with certain commensal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, as well as other bacteria that are not well known or not known to be significant in respiratory illnesses (Figure S3C); thus, their presence does not seem to be related to virulence.	0
The genus @gm$ Mitsuokella @/gm$ was created based on morphological, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic criteria to include the species Multacidus and Dentalis. @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$ belongs to domain: Bacteria, phylum: Firmicutes, class: Clostridia, order: Clostridiales, family: Veillonellaceae, genus: @gm$ Mitsuokella @/gm$, species: Dentalis. It exhibits morpho; ogical similarities to Prevotella species except for its dissimilarities, such as absence of menaquinones and higher G + C contents (56-60 mol %) in @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$. @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$ grows better on blood agar with hemolysed blood. On enriched horse blood agar after 3 days of incubation, it forms convex, irregular, translucent, wet, and mucoid colonies of 1-2 mm in diameter, with a water drop appearance @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$ has a low virulence potential as a @di$ periodontal pathogen @/di$. It does not have the ability to activate latent human fibroblast type, neutrophil interstitial procollagenases that lead to degradation of Type I collagen that is an essential step for periodontal tissue invasion and disease progression. Low proportions of @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$ comprising 2% of organisms isolated from periodontal pockets implie its minimal role as a periodontopathogenic bacterium. @gm$ M. dentalis @/gm$ being a strict anaerobe is susceptible to metronidazole.	2
The implicated organisms can be Brachyspiraaalborgior @gm$ Brachyspirapilosicoli @/gm$. We present the case of a 66-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, @di$ hypertension @/di$, morbid obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux.	0
"The in vitro activities of mecillinam, a new beta-amidinopenicillin, and ampicillin, alone and in combination, against an Escherichia coli strain and a @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ strain were compared, and these results were correlated with their respective activities in vivo in experimental @di$ meningitis @/di$. The mecillinam-ampicillin combination was synergistic in vitro against both strains when tested by a modified checkerboard technique (bacteriostatic synergy). However when quantitative bactericidal synergy studies were made, the relative bactericidal rate of the combination was more rapid than that of either drug alone (""bactericidal synergy"") against the Escherichia coli isolate only. In a rabbit model of Enterobacteriaceae @di$ meningitis @/di$, in vivo bactericidal activity correlated with results obtained in vitro. Both drugs were administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 8 h. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibiotic levels were similar to those achieved in humans. Cerebrospinal fluid bacterial concentrations (colony-forming units [CFU] per milliliter) were quantitatively titrated at 2-h intervals. Both drugs, alone or the combination, were ineffective against the @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ strain in vivo (change in titer <1 log in 8 h)."	1
The isolated @di$ fecal coliform @/di$ (E. coli, @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$), P. aeruginosa were subjected to a threat assessment test. Due to the production of virulence factor(s), 88.23% of the isolated E. coli produced beta hemolytic colonies, while 11.77% didn't show hemolytic colonies. The @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$ (100%) didn't give hemolytic colonies.	1
The issue of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$-associated @di$ appendicitis @/di$ remains contentious, with a study re-examining archived appendices using nucleic acid testing detecting @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ in 22% of specimens.	1
The lung is the most common infection site and symptoms of nocardiosis are similar to TB or NTM infection, such as @di$ fever @/di$, cough and chest pain. The genus Tsukamurella is an aerobic actinomycete and was a cause of opportunistic infection. @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$ are Gram-negative bacilli and opportunistic human pathogens.	0
The main clinical findings in affected pigs included: fever (40.5-41.8 degrees C), prostration, inappetence, dog-sitting posture, abortion, @di$ erythema @/di$ and raised, firm to the touch and easily palpated light pink to dark purple diamond-shaped to square/rectangular spots on the skin around the belly and the back. Based on the pathognomonic skin lesions, a clinical diagnosis of swine erysipelas was made. The diagnosis was confirmed by the isolation of @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ organisms from the blood and skin biopsies taken from the affected pigs.	1
The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1-P, 1-As, and 1-Ge were determined against four kinds of bacteria, including the two pathogenic bacteria strains, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$. The three novel polyanions also showed high cytotoxic potency in the human cell lines A549 (non-small cell lung cancer), CH1/PA-1 (@di$ ovarian teratocarcinoma @/di$), and SW480 (colon carcinoma).	0
The most common Brucella species that are reported to infect humans include @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, Brucella suis, Brucella canis, Brucella abortus, and Brucella neotomae. Brucellosis is a potentially life-threatening multi-organ granulomatous disease that has a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from fever and flu-like symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and fatigue, to more chronic manifestations of @di$ hepatitis @/di$, orchitis, arthritis, encephalomyelitis, and/or endocarditis.	1
The neutrophil function studies performed during and after a period of iron deficiency showed the following: Phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus 502A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ was not altered by iron deficiency or by the administration of iron; phagocytosis of Candida albicans was moderately abnormal during iron deficiency, and became normal with the restoration of iron sufficiency. Microbicidal activity towards Staphylococcus aureus 502A and Candida albicans, two catalase-positive microorganisms, was markedly decreased (to 50% of control values) and returned to normal when iron sufficiency was restored. Killing of a catalase-negative organism, Streptococcus pneumoniae was normal in iron-deficient rats. This pattern of differential bactericidal activities suggested an abnormality of the oxidant radical-generating machinery in neutrophils of iron-deficient animals. Indeed, iron deficiency caused a marked decrease of neutrophil nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, which disappeared after iron administration. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity was slightly decreased in iron deficient rats and returned to normal after iron administration. Microbicidal activity towards a gram-negative, catalase-positive organism, @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$, was equal in iron deficient and iron sufficient animals. Our combined results suggest that a definite microbicidal defect is the consequence of nutritional iron deficiency, apart from any @di$ protein-calorie malnutrition @/di$.	0
The pathological manifestations of brucellosis are diverse and include arthritis, @di$ endocarditis @/di$, and meningitis in humans, while animal brucellosis is characterized by spontaneous abortion. Six species are recognized within the genus @gm$ Brucella @/gm$: B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, B. canis, and B. neotomae. This classification is mainly based on the difference in pathogenicity and in host preference. The main pathogenic species worldwide are B. abortus, responsible for bovine brucellosis; B. melitensis, the main etiologic agent of ovine and caprine brucellosis, a disease that causes abortion in ewes and goats resulting in huge economic losses, particularly in Mediterranean countries and B. suis responsible for swine brucellosis. B. abortus infection is acquired by humans through contact with infected livestock and consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and B. canis are responsible for ram epididymitis and canine brucellosis, respectively. For B. neotomae only strains isolated from desert rats have been reported. @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ strains have also been isolated from a great variety of wildlife species such as bison, elk, feral swine, foxes, hares, African Buffalo, reindeer, and caribou.	1
"The periodontal pathogens Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ (common in GI infections) are considered as ""mobile microbiome"" that originates in the OC but also associated with extra-oral infections and inflammation. Rothia, Streptococcus, and Prevotella produce @di$ oral ALD @/di$ that promote oral carcinogenesis (Table 3). Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella are considered as anti-inflammatory mediators, whereas Selenomonas, Parvimonas, and @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ are considered as pro-inflammatory mediators."	1
The piglets were blood-sampled for analysis of serum gamma-globulin and necropsied, and the intestines were sampled for histopathology and cultured for Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$. Escherichia coli isolates (n = 276) were examined by PCR for virulence genes encoding LT, STa, STb, EAST1, VT2e, F4, F5, F6, F18, F41, AIDA-I, intimin, and for the genes aaiC and aggR. Selected isolates were analysed for additional virulence genes by a microarray and subjected to O-typing. Clostridium perfringens isolates (n = 152) were examined by PCR for genes encoding major toxins, enterotoxin and beta2-toxin. There was no difference in serum gamma-globulin concentration between diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets, and pathological lesions in the intestines were generally mild. Porcine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, a common cause of @di$ piglet diarrhoea @/di$, was only found in two piglets. Further, the virulence gene profiling did not suggest involvement of other diarrhoeogenic pathotypes of Escherichia coli. Growth of Clostridium perfringens did not differ between diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets. All isolates were type A, all were negative for enterotoxin, and 151 of 152 isolates were beta2-toxin positive. In pigs >= 2  days old, moderate to profuse growth of @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ was more common in the controls. In conclusion, it was not possible to relate Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens type A and C or @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$ to neonatal porcine diarrhoea in any of the investigated herds.	0
The pneumopericardium diminished; however, he developed effusive-constrictive pericarditis with overt @di$ heart failure @/di$ symptoms. Because pericardiocentesis failed to relieve the symptoms, pericardiectomy was performed. Intraoperative exploration revealed remarkably thickened pericardium and epicardium constituting multiple layers with purulent effusion. Epicardiectomy as well as pericardiectomy were required to achieve the effective reduction of central venous pressure. Perforation of the gastric conduit into the pericardial cavity was identified and repaired. Histopathology demonstrated thickened pericardium composed of hyalinized stroma, collagenous bundles, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ and Candida tropicalis were identified by culture of the resected tissue.	1
The population structure of @di$ NDM-like @/di$-producing isolates studied by MLST is shown in Table 1. All isolates of @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ complex, except the E. asburiae strain, which were recovered from hospital B1, belonged to ST182. Of note was that the NDM-4-producing isolate of @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ complex that was isolated, in 2012, from the patient previously hospitalized in Sri Lanka (Papagiannitsis et al.,) was also assigned to ST182.	1
The predominant HG in fish, fish-eggs and freshwater samples was @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ HG 3 because 63% (22/37), 28% (16/57) or 80% (16/20) of the strains, respectively, were in HG 3. A. hydrophila HG 2 was also common in fresh fish samples but was not identified in fish-egg samples. HG 7 was common in fish samples studied for fish diseases and in freshwater samples. Strains which were not allotted to any HGs were common (19 of 143 strains). @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ HG 1, A. caviae HG 4, A. veronii subspecies sobria or subspecies veronii HG 8/10 known to be associated with human @di$ diarrhea @/di$ were uncommon in all samples.	1
The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of these biofilms on the microbiological, chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of PDO @di$ Vastedda della valle del Belice @/di$ (@di$ VdB @/di$) cheese, processed traditionally from raw ewe's milk using wooden tools. To this purpose, the experimental cheeses after 15 d of refrigerated storage were examined. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations dominated the microbial community of all samples. The species more frequently identified were @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ among starter LAB and Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Pediococcus pentosaceus among non starter LAB. Culture-independent analysis of microbiota diversity was performed by MiSeq Illumina that identified Streptococcus as major group followed by members of Enterobacteriaceae family, @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$ and Lactobacillus. Generally, the seven tree species did not negatively affect the physicochemical composition of @di$ VdB @/di$ cheeses. Chestnut (both Sicilian and Calabrian) vats produced cheeses with significant lower hue angle (a*/b*) than other wood types. Among chemical parameters, significant variations were registered for aw, primary and secondary lipid oxidation state (significantly lower for the @di$ VdB @/di$ cheeses produced with poplar wood), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).	0
The probiotics Lactobacillus coryniformis MXJ32 and @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ reduced the occurrence of @di$ colonic lesions @/di$ and attenuated the severity of the disease in colon cancer mouse models by enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.	2
The reduction in B.vulgatus and @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ may result in loss of protective benefits of these microbes. @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ produces succinate and secondary bile acids, which alleviate obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Metabolism is emerging as a key regulator of immune function and thus this reduction in @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ could influence immune responses in such a way to promote cancer progression. B.vulgatus inhibits @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ and decreases gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production, which suppresses pro-inflammatory immune responses.	2
The relationship between gut microbiota and @di$ obesity @/di$ has also been widely studied. Ley et al. reported that the diversity of microbiota might be influenced by @di$ obesity @/di$. The amount of @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ has been reported to be dramatically elevated in @di$ obese @/di$ children compared to children with normal weight in India.	1
The relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing bacteria from the genera Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Coprococcus, Akkermansia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Eubacterium was found to be lower in GDM women, @di$ obese @/di$ and T2DM.	2
The relative abundances of Porphyromonadaceae and @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ were higher in the fecal microbiota of the DSS group compared with those of the HB1628 group. Porphyromonadaceae is considered a main pathogen in IBD and is linked to intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation. The role of @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ in IBD is unclear, but a related species within the same genus, Alistipes finegoldii, is a known trigger of intestinal inflammation. In addition, during the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IBD, patients typically suffer not only from gastrointestinal symptoms but also from some mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and stress. A pre-clinical study that transferred the gut microbiota of @di$ colitis @/di$ mice to germ-free mice induced anxiety-like and desperate behaviors, further confirming the active role of the host's gut microbiota in driving behavioral changes through intestinal inflammation.	1
The results of current study shown that the rise of some beneficial bacterium and the decline of the harmful bacterium in probiotics group, suggesting that the intestinal flora structure of the stricken broiler was improved by @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ BS15. Recent literatures have shown that the growth performance of the host can be affected by the intake of exogenous probiotics through changing the gastrointestinal tract flora (Layton et al.; Sanchez et al.). Bacteroidetes is one of the main predominant flora in the GIT of chicken (Lan et al.), which is also considered as the main bacteria to promote the use of carbohydrates (Brown et al.). The proportion of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes can be effective against @di$ obesity @/di$ (Ley et al.; Xin et al.), which is a key indicator in response to the lipid metabolism (Cui et al.). In the present study, the apparent reduction of Bacteroidetes in the jejunum and ileum of injured chicks in SNE group was observed, and the number of Firmicutes did not vary across all of the groups throughout the experimental period, implying the increase of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in SNE chicks. However, this trend was attenuated by supplementation of probiotics, manifesting that the @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ BS15 addition may play a positive effect on lipid metabolism via adjusting the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in the gut to decline the fat deposition.	2
The results of our study showed that Acinetobacter baumannii is the predominant cause of respiratory infections, the most frequent clinical manifestations of Acinetobacter infections are ventilator-associated @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Dima and colleagues also report that the @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species are predominant cause of ventilator-associated @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Moreover, researchers from Poland showed the results similar to our study, reporting a high percentage of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species as a cause of nosocomial infections in the ICU. Exogenous transmission of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ should be considered when infections are endemic and when case rates increase.	1
The strain has excellent fermentation capacity, high robustness and stress tolerance, and also displays excellent performance in fed-batch production on molasses, is tolerant to @di$ dehydration @/di$ and retains high vitality during storage and transport. Using this strain, we have developed the first industrial S. cerevisiae strain that converts D-xylose to ethanol with a yield close to the theoretical maximum yield and with a very high specific rate of fermentation. For that purpose, a recombinant strain was first constructed by chromosomal integration of codon-optimized XylA from @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ in an over-expression gene cassette containing genes of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the D-xylose transporting hexose transporter HXT7.	0
The transparency of zebrafish larvae has made direct visualization of the initiation of the @di$ granuloma @/di$ possible following infection with @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$. Studies based on this model have revealed that the innate immune response is sufficient to initiate the @di$ granuloma @/di$ following infection. Recruitment of additional macrophages mediated, in part, by mycobacterial ESX-1 proteins initiates a cascade of events that leads to the establishment of the @di$ mycobacterial granuloma @/di$. Importantly, recruited macrophages can traffic through the initial @di$ granuloma @/di$ to phagocytose apoptotic infected macrophages and egress to form distal secondary granulomas. Mycobacterial lipids play a key role in establishing the @di$ granuloma @/di$ by limiting macrophage effector functions and promoting the recruitment of additional macrophages to facilitate dissemination. In particular, mycobacterial PDIM can mask TLR-signaling and prevent induction of nitrosative stresses and mycobacterial phenolic glycolipid (PGL) can induce macrophage production of CCL2 to recruit CCR2+ monocytes that permit bacterial dissemination. These studies collectively indicate that the initiation of the @di$ mycobacterial granuloma @/di$ is dependent on recruitment of bacteria-permissive macrophages and monocytes following initial infection and can be mediated by mycobacterial secreted factors and membrane lipids.	1
The use of different species of Pistachio as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-@di$ atherogenic @/di$, hypoglycemia, antitumor and facilitating hepatic function is  known. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the effect of P. atlantica leaf extract (aqueous) on bacterial (S. mutans, S. mitis and @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$.) load in mouth and saliva.	2
The vaginal microbiome of both cohorts was dominated by @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, as reported by previous studies associated with pregnancy. Indeed, lactobacilli are key players in the vagina, protecting women at a reproductive age against the colonization of potential exogenous pathogens, probably through the production of lactic acid and the decrease of pH. As for, @di$ preterm birth @/di$ no significances differences between groups were reported although there was a higher percentage of @di$ preterm birth @/di$ were shown in the IVF group (6.67% vs 17.67%; 0 = 0.203). This result disagrees with a recent meta-analysis concluding that the risk of @di$ PTB @/di$ in singleton pregnancies resulting from IVF/ICSI is significantly greater than that in spontaneously conceived singletons. Given that the aim of our study wasn't to show if @di$ PTB @/di$ is more likely in IVF pregnancies, the design and sample size could explain why differences were not found.	0
Then calculated the random effect size of each marker based on standardized mean differences and selected the 21 biomarkers with the largest effect size, and are associated with @di$ CRC @/di$ in all three datasets or associated with controls in all three datasets (Fig. 6A) and validated on the Japanese dataset (258 @di$ CRC @/di$ cases and 246 healthy controls) and the Austrian dataset (46 @di$ CRC @/di$ cases and 57 healthy controls). The small set of RF-specific markers (21 species) has similar performance compared with the larger set of RF-specific markers (58 species) on the USA, Chinese, and French datasets (cross-validation AUC score range from 0.62 to 0.78 AUC) (Fig. 6B) and cross-validation AUC scores on Austrian and Japanese datasets were 0.66 and 0.61. Among the 21 microbial markers, 14 species have the largest effect size in @di$ CRC @/di$ samples, whereas 7 species have the largest effect size in control samples across the USA, China, and France regions (Random-effect model fit, P < 0.0001). The species associated with @di$ CRC @/di$ include C. symbiosum, F. nucleatum, R. torque, G. morbillorum, S. moorei, P. micra, Clostridium citroniae, and others. In contrast, most of the nonpathogenic microbial species associated with controls include E. eligens, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, E. hallii, Bifidobacterium catenlatum, and others (Fig. 6A). Most of the @di$ CRC @/di$ biomarkers reported in this study are consistent with previous studies, where F. nucleatum reported as an oral pathogen was shown enriched in @di$ CRC @/di$ patients, P. stomatis and S. moorei were reported as enriched in saliva and stool of @di$ CRC @/di$ patients, P. micra, an obligate anaerobe was associated with @di$ CRC @/di$ and @gm$ E. ventriosum @/gm$ was shown to be associated with healthy controls, and B. fragilis was identified as a @di$ CRC @/di$ biomarker in the previous studies.	2
There is also good evidence that certain fermented products (especially by @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$) have a mildly decreasing effect on @di$ hypertension @/di$, probably because of bioactive peptides. SUMMARY: When guiding principles such as balance, variety and moderation are stressed, there is no strong evidence that dairy products increase the risk of coronary heart disease in healthy men of all ages or young and middle-aged healthy women. Human studies should investigate the role of dairy products with respect to sex and age by including classic and novel risk markers of coronary heart disease. Specific fermented milks may be beneficial in the future prevention of @di$ hypertension @/di$.	2
There is recent evidence that probiotics can reduce behaviors associated with stress, anxiety, and @di$ depression @/di$ by improving the role of GABA, a prevalent neurotransmitter in the brain. reported some biochemical and behavioral parameters (including anxiety, sociability, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and tryptophan metabolism) that could be reversed in germ-free mice by re-colonization with a conventional microbiota or probiotic treatment. Moreover, other effects of probiotics on brain functions have been reported., feeding mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, showed changed levels of signaling chemicals in the brain as well as increased numbers of receptors associated with learning, memory and emotional control. In humans, showed how a combination of @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium longum improved health scores designed to assess mental health, and chronically administered in rats, significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviors.	2
There were no treatment effects (P > 0.05) in @di$ weight gain @/di$ from d 1 to 21. Similarly, from d 22 to 42, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in @di$ weight gain @/di$ between treatments; however, @di$ weight gain @/di$ was higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control group. During the total period, @di$ weight gain @/di$ was also similar (P > 0.05) between treatments, but higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control groups except for the 750 and 1250 ppm coriander extract in water, where the @di$ weight gain @/di$ did not differ (P > 0.05) from that of the control. Previous studies have reported the beneficial effects of coriander on broiler performance.. This positive improvement could be attributed to the essential oil, linalool, present in coriander seed. It has been documented that coriander oil possesses antimicrobial properties against selected pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms. The inhibition of harmful intestinal microorganisms by coriander oil will have positive effect on poultry health and performance as seen in this study. Cabuk et al. likewise reported that linalool affected Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, and Clostridium perfringens negatively.	2
There were significant differences in the fecal microbiota collected from older adults with @di$ frailty @/di$ and healthy controls. The relative abundances of Parabacteroides, Akkermansia, Klebsiella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Pyramidobacter, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, and Dysgonomonas were found to be higher in older adults with @di$ frailty @/di$. In contrast, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Prevotella, Megamonas, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, Megasphaera, and Haemophilus were found to be enriched in the healthy controls compared with older adults with @di$ frailty @/di$ (Figures 3B, C).	1
Therefore, Akkermansia regulation is deemed a target to treat the following diseases: Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, coronary atherosclerosis, @di$ obesity @/di$, insulin resistance and alcoholic liver disease. In our study, Akkermansia transplantation was performed to confirm whether Akkermansia was able to ameliorate vascular calcification. Interestingly, Akkermansia supplementation was suggested to relieve vascular calcification. Analysis of gut microbiota diversity showed that orally delivered Akkermansia changed the composition and structure of the microbiota. Akkermansia is a bacterium that degrades mucins, producing acetate, propionate and small nitrogen-containing molecules. Non-mucin-degrading bacteria utilise carbon and nitrogen sources provided by Akkermansia, promoting their own growth and colonisation. It has been reported that cocultured Akkermansia and non-mucin-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Roseburia and Eubacterium hallii, can mutually promote growth and butyrate production. In the present study, it was also found that orally delivered Akkermansia significantly increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, promoted plasma and faecal SCFA levels, reduced the abundance of LPS-producing bacteria and reduced the source of plasma LPS. Research has shown that Akkermansia can prevent high-fat diet-induced dysbiosis by depleting @di$ obesity @/di$-related pathogenic bacteria and enriching health-related gut microbiota constituents.	2
Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate alterations in the gut microbiota, immune responses and metabolites (SCFA production) in a mouse model of DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ after treatment with P. pentosaceus LI05. Mice treated with P. pentosaceus LI05 in the present study showed a significant amelioration of symptoms, including improvements in body weight loss, DAI score, colon length shortening and intestinal permeability. In addition, marked shifts in the compositions of the gut microbiota and metabolites were observed in mouse faecal samples, and the altered taxa might mediate dysbiosis in @di$ colitis @/di$. Intriguingly, the administration of P. pentosaceus LI05 increased the abundance of specific genera, such as Akkermansia and @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$, and helped regulate the gut microbiota, reduce host inflammation and increase SCFA production.	2
Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic properties of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in treating MAFLD in an @di$ obese @/di$ mice model induced by high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diets, which well mimics the humans daily diet and is critical for inducing hepatocyte injury and driving the development of fatty liver-associated disease. Our second aim was to investigate the molecular mode of action of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ by identifying the significant metabolites correlated with MAFLD treatment. This was carried out by performing hepatic metabolomics analysis of the liver samples from @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$-treated mice, in terms of the important pathological pathways leading to MAFLD and by relevant intervention studies in cell models. Our data revealed that mice treated with @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ efficiently increased lipid oxidation and bile acid metabolism, thus maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier and reshaping the gut microbiota composition.	2
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens and @gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$ in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 @di$ edentulous @/di$ subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. Microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of the tongue were taken from all subjects. In addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. All samples were analysed using a bacterial DNA-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and @di$ edentulous @/di$ subjects. When cheek and tongue samples were combined, C. rectus, A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (P<0.05). In dentate subjects, P. intermedia and T. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of @di$ edentulous @/di$ subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.	0
These animals must be from registered establishments under the control of the competent authority, with a system to maintain and to keep up-to-date animal health records, receiving regular animal health visits and not subject to any ban on animal health grounds (including @di$ rabies @/di$). Also, dogs must be marked by universal transponder chips. The same regulations are applied for the transport of dogs within the EU member states and described in the regulation 2020/688. Regarding the health status, dogs must be vaccinated against @di$ rabies @/di$, accompanied by a passport, have a health certificate issued by an official veterinarian and if entering Finland or Malta, be treated against Echinococcus multilocularis. Otherwise, currently there are no other measures in place to prevent the spread of @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ by dogs in the EU. Only very recently, Iceland and now more and more EU countries have added @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ free status as a requirement for import of dogs, while the UK recommends testing, but there are no legal powers to enforce this.	0
These bacterial metabolites have been shown to increase muscle mass in mice by inhibiting @di$ muscle atrophy @/di$. In humans, butyrate metabolism pathways and genetically determined synthesis of butyrate have been associated with lean mass. Interestingly, all the three anabolic bacteria identified in the present study have been shown to produce SCFAs: C. comes produces acetate and butyrate, D. longicatena produces acetate and formate, and @gm$ E. ventriosum @/gm$ produces butyrate.	2
These examinations identified 11 cases of Streptococcus suis, six cases of @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$, one Streptococcus spp. and two cases that remained aetiologically undetermined. One of the S. suis cases had a dual infection with S. suis in the aortic valve lesions and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis in the atrioventricular valve lesions. Renal infarcts were present in eight cases. Focal @di$ encephalitis @/di$ was found in 12 cases, with the number of lesions ranging from one to 11.	0
These include the human-specific pathogen @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$, which also causes enteric fever, and some isolates of S. Dublin, which causes an enteric fever-like disease in humans with high @di$ fever @/di$ and bacteremia but little gastrointestinal disease. Interestingly, Vi capsule expression is not constrained to Salmonella spp. Both the opportunistic human pathogens Citrobacter freundii and Bordetella petrii as well as soil bacteria in the genus Achromobacter have homologs of viaB genes and produce Vi capsule. Unlike Vi capsule-producing Salmonella spp., little is known about regulation of capsule expression in B. petrii and Achromobacter spp., but the genomes of these organisms do not contain a tviA homolog. Although C. freundii regulates its Vi capsule expression via an insertion sequence 1-like element that inserts into a recombinational hotspot in the viaB locus, it does have a tviA homolog called vipR. Alignment of the tviA 5' UTRs from Salmonella spp. as well as the C. freundii vipR 5' UTR sequence revealed conservation of the fourU RNAT motif within all the tviA sequences, whereas C. freundii vipR lacks the fourU RNAT motif (S7 Fig). Interestingly, the @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ and S. Dublin tviA 5' UTR sequences lack the bulging adenine immediately 5' to the SD region in the S. Typhi tviA 5' UTR, which may stabilize the tviA 5' UTR structure, requiring higher temperatures to melt the RNAT and enable translation in these serovars (Figs 2A and S7). However, without experimentally testing the @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ and S.	1
These included a change in leuA, resulting in E108K substitution, which caused @di$ leucine auxotrophy @/di$ and a mutation in rpoB, likely responsible for the rifampicin resistance. Nonsense mutations were detected in PA2735 and PA1939 encoding a DNA methyltransferase and a putative OLD family endonuclease, respectively. Analysis of revertants in these two genes showed that PA2735 is a component of a restriction-modification system, independent of PA1939. Moreover, a 12 kb RPG42 prophage and a novel 108 kb PAPI-1 like integrative conjugative element (ICE) encompassing a mercury resistance operon were identified. The ICEPae1161 was transferred to @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$ cells, where it integrated in the genome and conferred the mercury resistance.	0
This could potentially result in a reduction in the consumption of antibiotics used for treating @di$ diarrhoea @/di$. Today, these @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ outbreaks will, under normal Danish practical conditions, result in antibiotic batch medication, and therefore a diagnostic procedure should be able to identify the non-infectious outbreaks (high herd-level diagnostic specificity) in order to reduce antibiotic consumption. On the other hand, it could result in severe production losses if antibiotic treatment regimes were terminated in herds that were actually suffering from @di$ HP diarrhoea @/di$. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure needed to result in diagnostic test results with a high probability (high herd-level negative predictive value) that the outbreak would be truly LP diarrhoea when a negative test result was obtained. The results of the study demonstrated that it was difficult to select a diagnostic procedure and criteria that would provide acceptable levels of both herd-level sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic procedure that performed best had Hspe =0.80 and Hnpv =0.96. This implies that it will be possible to identify 80% of the LP diarrhoea outbreaks, with a negligible risk of the @di$ HP diarrhoea @/di$ outbreaks being falsely classified. In this diagnostic procedure, the sum of the pathogenic bacterial loads was used without taking the individual bacterial species into consideration. This procedure was considered acceptable, since the majority of the @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ outbreaks involved different combinations of L. intracellularis-, E. coli- and @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$-associated intestinal disease.	1
This is consistent with @di$ diabetic @/di$ subjects being more concerned about food consumption (high cholesterol, carbohydrate, and sodium) and increased risk of complications of @di$ diabetes @/di$. Although Bacteroidetes is well known to be associated with protein/fat diets, a positive correlation with brown rice was found in OB subjects. Whilst we did not specifically identify the species, there is evidence suggesting that an increase in abundance of some Bacteroides strains results from competition with other members for fiber-derived nutrients. With respect to small numbers of subjects used in our study, the positive relationship of abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia and @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$) with fasting glucose levels of different groups (L, OV and T2DM) may not sufficiently explain the association between these bacteria and the presence of glucose.	1
This report highlights the potential virulence of @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ in @di$ infection of the head and neck @/di$ and the need to consider this organism in selected patients.	1
This study also found that @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ and Streptococcus are CC protecting microorganisms, and Erysipelotrichaceae, Coprococcus sp_ART55_1 and Eubacterium siraeum are protective factors for CR. Previous studies have found that the abundance of Streptococcus and Erysipelotrichaceae is significantly higher in adjacent tissues than in tumors, and that abundance in the oral cavity is associated with a reduced risk of @di$ CRC @/di$. But there are also studies showing that Streptococcus and Erysipelotrichaceae are more common in patients with advanced colorectal adenomas or @di$ CRC @/di$. Erysipelotrichaceae was significantly higher in the tumor group of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced @di$ colon cancer @/di$ animal models. Butyrate inhibits the development of @di$ CRC @/di$, and a significant decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria in the intestine, including @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ (Eubacterium siraeum and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$), is generally observed in @di$ CRC @/di$ patients. The abundance of Eubacterium spp. was lower in the advanced colorectal adenoma group than in the healthy control group. At present, there are relatively few studies on these bacteria and @di$ colorectal cancer @/di$ proposed in this study, and more studies and experiments are needed to verify these results and explore the specific mechanisms.	2
This study assessed the characteristics of hospital-acquired @gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$-Acinetobacter baumannii complex @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ (@di$ BSI @/di$). From 2010 to 2017, @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$-A. baumannii complex @di$ BSI @/di$ were investigated. Of 73 cases, 54.8% were associated with Acinetobacter pittii, 39.7% with Acinetobacter baumannii and 5.5% with Acinetobacter nosocomialis. Multi-drug-resistant isolates were significantly higher in A. baumannii @di$ BSI @/di$. Thirty-day mortality was no different between A. baumannii or non-baumannii @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$-A. baumannii complex @di$ BSI @/di$. In contrast with other studies, this study found that most hospital-acquired @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$-A. baumannii complex @di$ BSI @/di$ were associated with non-baumannii @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$-A. baumannii complex species. This study found that these species were important hospital-acquired pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$-A.	1
This study examined the composition of the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profiles in 68 patients with HCC, 33 patients with @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ (@di$ LC @/di$), and 34 healthy individuals (NC) using a combination of metagenome sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (@di$ LC @/di$-MS). The composition of the serum metabolites and the structure of the intestinal microbiota were found to be significantly altered in HCC patients compared to non-HCC patients. LEfSe and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis were used to identify two key species (Odoribacter splanchnicus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$) and five key metabolites (ouabain, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholate, theophylline, and xanthine) associated with HCC, which then were combined to create panels for HCC diagnosis.	1
This study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. Fresh faecal samples were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. FISH was used to enumerate total (EUB338mix) and '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' (ATO291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1), respectively. The '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella intestinalis/Collinsella stercoris, Collinsella tanakaei, Coriobacteriaceae sp. PEAV3-3, Eggerthella lenta, @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$, Olsenella profusa, Olsenella uli and Paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the DGGE profiles of individuals. Colony PCR was used to identify '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated Collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. Eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). Isolates of Collinsella tanakaei, an 'Enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the '@di$ Atopobium cluster @/di$' were also identified in the study.	1
This study not only found an increased prevalence of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in mucosal biopsy samples from adults with UC but also identified DNA from this putative pathogen in one in ten controls. @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ is a common commensal in the oral mucosa and it has been associated with periodontitis. A study by Zhang et al aimed to look at the relative rates of isolation and detection of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from salivary samples of healthy controls and patients with IBD but did not find any significant difference between the two groups (97% vs. 100%). Protein profiling of six of the oral strains were compared with an intestinal strain of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ using SDS-PAGE. Interestingly only one of the six oral strains matched the intestinal strain, suggesting that different strains of the bacteria may exist in the oral cavity with some having the ability to colonise the intestine. The increased detection of this oral commensal in UC may be as a result of defective innate immunity, allowing easier access to an additional ecological niche where the organism may potentially cause disease. This hypothesis is supported by the detection of this pathogen during episodes of @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in immunocompromised adults. Additionally, the finding of this bacterium in the extremes of age groups, who are characterized with poorer immunity, suggests that @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ may be an opportunistic pathogen.	1
Three biomarkers, Collinsella aerofaciens, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ and Dorea formicigenerans, which were more abundant in the @di$ overweight @/di$/obese group, presented positive associations with anthropometric variables: (a) WC exhibited positive associations with the abundance of Collinsella aerofaciens and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$; (b) BMI showed a positive association with @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$; and (c) the body weight was positively associated with Dorea formicigenerans (Figure 3a).	1

Three strains of @gm$ Peptostreptococcus productus @/gm$ were tested for growth at the expense of methoxylated aromatic compounds. Strain M8A-18 (human fecal isolate) was unable to utilize methoxylated aromatic compounds. While the type strain ATCC 27340 (human @di$ septicemia @/di$ isolate) was capable of minimal growth with methoxylated aromatic compounds, ATCC 35244 (sewage sludge isolate) displayed significant growth on methoxylated aromatic compounds.	0
Through this approach, we identified archaeal RNA as the pivotal MAMP of @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ that activates TLR8 and, to a lesser extent, TLR7. Moreover, @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ triggers a so far undescribed TLR8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway in human monocytes that shares elements of canonical and alternative inflammasome activation. Thus, our findings describe in detail the molecular mechanisms by which @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ induces inflammatory responses in human monocytes, which will provide the first steps toward understanding how archaea interact with their host in the gut microbiota and elucidating the potential role of these microorganisms in inflammatory diseases such as @di$ IBD @/di$ or lung hyperresponsiveness.	1
"Thus, the organisms that cause @di$ typhoid and paratyphoid A fever @/di$, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) and S. Paratyphi A, respectively, belong to a large family of Salmonella organisms. There are about 2,000 members or serotypes differentiated by the surface ""O"" and ""H"" antigens found in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagella, respectively, of these bacteria. Serotypes with a common immunodominant ""O"" antigen are grouped together. Thus, S. Typhi belongs to serogroup D in which the common antigens are O9 and O12, while S. Paratyphi A belongs to serogroup A which has O2 and O12. Another member which causes @di$ paratyphoid fever @/di$ but found infrequently and only in certain geographical regions, S. Paratyphi B, belongs to serogroup B (O4 and O12). A third paratyphoid member, @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$, which is also infrequently found and causes a milder disease, belongs to serogroup C (O6 and O7)."	1
Thus, the prospect for the use of selected bacteria or their antigens as a vaccine to interfere with the microbial changes and resulting progression of @di$ periodontal tissue destruction @/di$ has been proposed. As a first step in examining the use of bacterial antigens as immunogens in @di$ periodontitis @/di$, this study characterized the humoral immune response in Macaca fascicularis after systemic immunization with intact Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$. Parental immunization of the nonhuman primate with the intact bacteria resulted in the production of specific and significantly elevated levels of antibodies to P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, with the predominant isotype being immunoglobulin G (IgG). In contrast, the principal response to the nonoral, intestinal bacterium, @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$, was of the IgM isotype. Immunization increased IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody by 14-227 fold to P. gingivalis and 8-108 fold to P. intermedia. The level of serum IgA antibody increased (77-227 fold). The kinetics of the antibody response post-immunization and post-ligation differed with respect to each of the bacteria tested. IgG antibody to P. gingivalis increased through week 16 of the experiment and remained elevated above baseline through week 32. The IgG antibody level to P. intermedia peaked at 4 weeks following the third immunization and decreased post-ligation to near baseline levels by week 16. Characterization of the immune response after active immunization in the nonhuman primate has demonstrated a substantial and specific increase in antibody response which was sustained for several weeks. The insights obtained from these studies should help optimize the potential for immunologic interference with progressing @di$ periodontitis @/di$.	1
Thus, they are often isolated from the oral cavity, for example, in @di$ periodontitis @/di$ or sinusitis. There are six known species of Veillonella: @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$, @gm$ Veillonella alcalescens @/gm$, Veillonella atypica, Veillonella dispar, Acidaminococcus fermentans, and Megasphaera elsdenii. Only @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ and @gm$ V. alcalescens @/gm$ have been isolated from clinical specimens.	1
To achieve the goal of amelioration of diseases related to @di$ leaky gut syndromes @/di$, the administration of probiotics is one of the optimal approaches. Main aims of administration of probiotics may comprise enhancing the integrity of intestinal epithelial layer, increasing in optimal IgA production, modulation of homeostatic bile acids production and secretion, and increase in production of antimicrobial peptides). In general, traditional widely used probiotics such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp., Lactobacillus spp.	2
To explore the effector molecules underlying @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ relieving inflammation through CD206+ macrophages, we performed RNA sequencing in BMDMs after incubated with @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ or PBS for 24 hours. Results showed that 1846 genes in BMDMs were significantly upregulated, while 1845 genes were downregulated after incubated with @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ (Figure S6A). Then we intersected this RNA sequencing results with the macrophage activation gene set (GO:0042116) (Figure 3c). In line of this, 37 genes were significantly up-regulated and 7 genes were down-regulated in BMDMs after treatment with @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ (Figure S6B). The volcano map showed that Il10 was the second up-regulated gene (Figure 3d). IL-10 played a regulatory role in @di$ IBD @/di$. @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ supplementation could increase the secretion of Il-10 in both BMDMs and Raw264.7 cells in vitro by ELISA and western blot assays (Figure 3e). Immunofluorescence detection showed that the content of Il-10 in colitis tissues was increased after @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ treatment (figure 3f). In particular, @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ could increase the expression of Il-10 in CD206+ macrophages in BMDMs (Figure 3g).	2
To further explore whether @di$ PCP @/di$-induced genera are responsible for the improvement of the anti-cancer efficacy of 5-FU, we selected the candidate bacteria for bacteria transplantation. From the 16S sequencing data, we identified two bacteria genera, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus, that displayed significant responses to PCP treatment, alone or in the presence of 5-FU. At the 4-week treatment time point, we observed diminishing OTUs of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Lactobacillus in most experimental groups (Fig. 6A). This phenomenon might be associated with the increased number of polyps in the mice. Based on these data, we selected two bacteria from each genus, the @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ and Lactobacillus johnsonii, to engage in the implantation experiment. The colonization of the implanted bacteria was monitored by PCR with each specific primer sequence. The data showed that both implanted bacteria successfully colonized the recipient ApcMin/+ (Fig. 6C). The data also showed that 5-FU suppressed the growth of @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ and L. johnsonii (Fig. 6C). Moreover, transplantation of @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ and L.	2
To further validate the suspected presence of identical bacterial species across the Parmesan cheese production chain, we focused on the genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ due to the availability of a genus-specific profiling tool based on the Internally Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequence, allowing a very accurate bifidobacterial identification at Phylotype level, i.e., between species and strain level. Sequencing of all CF, MIL, and @di$ PC @/di$ samples resulted in a total of 4,580,699 quality-filtered reads, with an average of 39,832 reads per sample (Supplementary Table 3).	0
To illustrate the microbial and metabolic signature of prediabetes and @di$ diabetes @/di$, we exploit the potential of microbiome and metabolites for classifying prediabetes and @di$ diabetes @/di$ from controls. The strategy of combining classical statistics and multivariate statistics were carried out, and we found the biomarkers distinguishing prediabetes from controls using traditional risk factors, and biomarkers that distinguished @di$ diabetes @/di$ from controls using P value based on one-way ANOVA. Moreover, after 10-fold cross-validation, RF model showed highly promising performance for classifying prediabetes and @di$ diabetes @/di$ from controls (prediabetes vs. controls, @di$ diabetes @/di$ vs. control) ( Figure 3 ). For @di$ diabetes @/di$, compared with models using traditional risk factors (AUC=0.938) or only using microbiome indicators (AUC=0.948), a RF algorithm integrating traditional risk factors with microbiome and metabolites performed better (AUC=0.971). The most informative microbiome features contributing to this classifier were @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Parabacteroides merdae, Ruminococcus lactaris, Bacteroides eggerthii, Prevotella copri, and Fusobacterium varium, and choline was more effective than TMAO for classifying @di$ diabetes @/di$ from controls (P value for Gini coefficient <0.05). To further elucidate whether sex has an effect on the microbial and metabolic signature, we also built models for classifying prediabetes and @di$ diabetes @/di$ from controls by sex ( Figure S2 ). For @di$ diabetes @/di$ in males, the most informative microbiome features contributing to this classifier were @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Fusobacterium varium, Parabacteroides merdae, Ruminococcus lactaris, Prevotella copri and Bacteroides eggerthii., For @di$ diabetes @/di$ in females, the most informative microbiome were Bacteroides eggerthii, Prevotella copri, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Parabacteroides merdae, Fusobacterium varium, as well as Ruminococcus lactaris.	1
To improve the preparedness against exposure to highly pathogenic bacteria and to anticipate the wide variety of bacteria that can cause @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ (@di$ BSIs @/di$), a safe, unbiased and highly accurate identification method was developed. Our liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method can identify highly pathogenic bacteria, their near-neighbors and bacteria that are common causes of @di$ BSIs @/di$ directly from positive blood culture flasks. The developed Peptide-Based Microbe Detection Engine (http://proteome2pathogen.com) relies on a two-step workflow: a genus-level search followed by a species-level search. This strategy enables the rapid identification of microorganisms based on the analyzed proteome. This method was successfully used to identify strains of Bacillus anthracis, Brucella abortus, @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$, Brucella suis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Burkholderia mallei, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis and closely related species from simulated blood culture flasks.	1
To observe whether @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ isolates were pathogenic to fish, we conducted an artificial challenge study under laboratory conditions. All 10 tested @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ isolates produced disease symptoms in artificially infected tilapia (O. niloticus) except for isolate F4S2. In O. niloticus, the first clinical sign appeared within 24 hours followed by the death of fish within 72 hours. Major clinical symptoms observed were corneal opacity combined with uni- or bi-lateral exophthalmia, erosion in tail followed by hemorrhage under pelvic fin and signs of @di$ asphyxiation @/di$ (Fig. 2). Among the @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ isolates, five (F1B1, F2B1, F2S1, F3S2 and FF11), two (F1B3 and F4E2), two (F3B2 and FF12) and one isolate (F4S2) were high, moderate, weak and avirulent, respectively (Fig. 3). We recovered the same bacterial isolates from the abdomen, brain, and tail of artificially challenged fish, and identified them as @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ based on their phenotypic characteristics.	1
To our knowledge, this is the first study where 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has been used to better understand the impact of a prebiotic intervention on GM in @di$ autism @/di$. B-GOS was able to modulate the GM composition in @di$ autistic @/di$ children on unrestricted diets, modulating bifidobacterial changes as well as in other bacterial groups, such as Lachnospiraceae family (Coprococcus spp., @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Oribacterium spp.), known to be butyrate-producing bacteria.	2
To test if lymphocytes played a critical role in @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ mediated protection from @di$ colitis @/di$, WT and RAG1-/- germ-free mice were mono-colonized with @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ for 7 days followed by 6 days exposure to 2% DSS. Despite equal colonization between WT and RAG1-/- mice (Supplementary Figure 9A), @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$ failed to prevent weight loss and gut inflammation as measured by fecal lipocalin in the absence of lymphocytes (Figure 3D).	2

Travelers' @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in Asia has been studied among Peace Corps volunteers in Thailand, Japanese travelers, foreign residents in Bangladesh, guests in hotels, and members of various tour groups. Rates of diarrheal attack of greater than 50% during four- to six-week sojourns were reported for these groups. Among travelers with @di$ diarrhea @/di$, the most commonly isolated pathogen was enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (20%-34%), followed by Salmonella (11%-15%), Shigella (4%-7%), Campylobacter (2%-5%), and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1%-13%). In 9%-22% of diarrheal episodes, multiple pathogens were recovered. Among Japanese travelers, Salmonella was more commonly acquired in the Far East; Shigella and Campylobacter, in the Indian subcontinent; and V. parahaemolyticus, in Southeast Asia. Aeromonas hydrophila and @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ were commonly isolated from ill travelers in Thailand but less frequently from other travelers.	1
Typhoid is an acute illness characterized by high fever, malaise, and @di$ abdominal pain @/di$. @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ causes systemic infection during which the pathogen colonizes the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes, the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and gallbladder. It is estimated that there are more than 20 million typhoid fever cases per year, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths. Although with adequate treatment most patients recover from the acute phase of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ infection, @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ can persist asymptomatically within the gallbladder following clinical recovery. Overall, 10% of those infected will carry @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ within their gallbladder for up to 3 months, while 1 to 3% will continue to harbor @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ for longer than 1 year. Given the host restriction of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$, chronic gallbladder carriage represents a key environmental reservoir of @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ bacteria, enabling typhoid transmission.	1
Understanding these factors is of interest as methanogens, and chiefly @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, have been implicated in @di$ periodontitis @/di$, a disease with major nutritional consequences in certain populations such as elderly people.	1

VanA-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates from @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ in Cuba were genetically characterized. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were assigned to sequence type (ST) 28, closely related to Eastern Europe, while @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ belonged to ST262, ST656 and ST1349, and showed different genetic profiles.	1

We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal @di$ abscesses @/di$ and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal @di$ abscess @/di$ yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms.	1
We ensured that @di$ granuloma @/di$ formation in the zebrafish embryo model occurred via recruitment of uninfected macrophages to single infected ones, as is likely in human tuberculosis. We infected embryos with wild-type (WT) @gm$ Mm @/gm$ into the hindbrain ventricle (Figure S1 available online) and monitored daily the fate of individual macrophages after they had migrated back into deeper brain tissues (Figure 1A). Infection expanded quickly into multiple macrophages (Figure 1A). These @di$ granulomas @/di$ did not form by aggregation of infected macrophages (Figure S2), suggesting that uninfected macrophages were recruited, then infected.	1
We found two additional plaque-associated species (Fournierella massiliensis and @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$) that met nominal statistical significance levels only in women with HIV. However, the associations between these gut bacterial species and carotid @di$ artery plaque @/di$ were generally consistent between women with and without HIV, and no effect modification by HIV serostatus was observed (all P for interaction > 0.05, Table S6).	0
We included human intervention studies that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomised controlled trials (parallel or cross-over), (2) published since 1990, (3) treatment duration of at least 14 days (at which some metabolic effect may occur, yet the short duration may reduce a chance to detect an effect), (4) use of probiotics (following genera: Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Oenococcus, @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$, Propionibacterium and Streptococcus) as key independent variables and (5) reported data on at least one difference between baseline and end of intervention related to the metabolic impairment using search terms: obese/-ity, diabetic/-es, weight, metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerant, glucose tolerant, glucose tolerance, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, impaired fasting glucose, waist circumference, abdominal adiposity, abdominal obesity, central obesity, visceral adipose tissue, visceral fat, visceral adiposity, fat, @di$ fatty liver @/di$, non-alcoholic fatty liver and irrespective of whether the investigators considered the outcome as primary or secondary criteria (see online supplementary file).	0
We performed both metagenomic and 16S rRNA sequencing on the stool samples of three subtypes of dystonia (27 cervical dystonia, 20 @di$ dopa-responsive dystonia @/di$ and 24 myoclonus-dystonia patients) and 25 controls. While microbiome alpha and beta diversity was not different between dystonia patients and controls, dystonia patients had higher abundances of Ruminococcus torques and @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, and a lower abundance of Butyrivibrio crossotus compared to controls.	0

We present a rare case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) infected with @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$. The patient presented with @di$ abdominal pain @/di$ and leukocytosis, without a palpable AAA. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a 3.1 x 3.0 cm infrarenal abdominal aneurysm with an extra-aortic fluid collection. At surgery, an in situ graft was placed. Intraoperative aortic wall cultures grew pansensitive @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$, and blood cultures remained negative. At 9-month follow-up, the patient was doing well without complaints. To our knowledge, this represents only the ninth reported case of an AAA with an aortic wall culture positive for @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$.	1
We present the case of a 49-year-old man with a bicuspid aortic valve who presented to the emergency department with limb weakness and a @di$ fever @/di$. Blood tests revealed a fulminant septic process with @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ bacteraemia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia.	1
We report a case of 65-old- year men, who presented with signs of acute abdomen, due to @di$ biliary peritonitis @/di$ as a complication of an acute acalculouscholecystitis caused by @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$.	1
We tallied all species that were positively or negatively associated with @di$ dental caries @/di$ in saliva and plaque with a p value <= 0.05 (Figure 2). Two studies found no species statistically significantly associated with either @di$ caries @/di$ or oral health, and 4 studies found species significantly associated only with @di$ caries @/di$ and 2 studies found species significantly associated only with oral health. Among the 24 articles reviewed, the most common statistically significant cariogenic species reported were Streptococcus mutans (14/24, 58.3%), Veillonella dispar (6/24, 25%), and @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$ (5/24, 20.8%). When limited to the 8 studies that corrected for multiple comparisons, Streptococcus mutans was associated with @di$ caries @/di$ 4/8 (50%) studies and Veillonella dispar was associated with @di$ caries @/di$ in 3/8 (37.5%).	1
When a stool sample tested positive for @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$, the patient was contacted by telephone by their GP or responsible physician if hospitalized. In a primary interview with the investigator, subjects were asked about their general health, previous medical records, and diarrheic symptoms. At first visit (day 1) the patient met the principal-investigator in an outpatient setting and was asked about the following general symptoms: headache, fatigue, sleeping difficulties, dizziness, itching, sensory disturbances, @di$ joint pain @/di$, back pain, dyspnoea, angina pectoris, and sweating. Hereafter, the patient was randomized to either azithromycin or placebo 500 mg once-daily dose for 3 days for the treatment of diarrhoea and blood (C-reactive Protein (CRP) and leukocytes) and saliva samples were collected. Subsequently, the participants answered daily questionnaires regarding diarrheic symptoms, number of stools per day, clinical symptoms and possible side effects to the medication for as long as symptoms persisted, or a total follow-up period of ten days. On day ten, the patient was contacted by telephone by the principal-investigator and asked about their current status. If patients stated ongoing diarrheic symptoms (i.e. no effect of either azithromycin or placebo) the patient was offered cross-over study treatment (azithromycin or placebo), also double-blinded, for three days, followed by another ten-day follow-up period. A secondary bacteriological endpoint was eradication of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in stool and saliva ten days after primary enrolment, defined as culture negative stool and saliva samples on day ten, using the methods described above.	1
When adult zebrafish are infected with @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$, they generate well-defined TB granulomas accompanied by typical central @di$ necrosis @/di$. In our study, we examined the functional relevance of the 20 AAs during mycobacterial infection and tuberculous granuloma formation in adult zebrafish. From previous studies, we selected effective AA concentrations for adult zebrafish treatments (Table S1), with RFP (50 mg/kg) as the positive control. We observed that only L-Tyr (1 mM) significantly reduced bacterial burden in adults and was not as effective as RFP (Figure 3a). The remaining AAs had no impact on the bacterial burden in adult zebrafish. Furthermore, L-Tyr supplementation markedly decreased high-burden or necrotic granuloma fractions in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$-infected adult zebrafish (Figure 3b-d and Figure S1).	1
When combined, WPI and GA can create an emulsion that protects @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ from @di$ cellular injury @/di$ during spray drying.	2
When samples in the analysis with at least one species with a median value of >=0.5% were included, fewer outliers were identified, with only one @di$ CAS @/di$ sample within the @di$ CAC @/di$ branch, and two @di$ CAC @/di$ within the second branch of the saliva samples. There was clearer separation of the samples, with @di$ CAC @/di$ on the first branch, with high abundance of Streptococcus mutans, compared to the saliva samples. The two saliva samples split into two branch points, with @di$ CFS @/di$ illustrating clustering within the first branch, with higher abundance of Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and Leptotrichia buccalis. Species with a clear low abundance in the majority of saliva samples included Scardovia wiggsiae, Parascardovia denticolens, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$ and Prevotella oris, where these were present at higher abundance in @di$ CAC @/di$.	1
While saline-treated mice had no sign of inflammation, MBS and @gm$ MSS @/gm$ induced dose-dependent histological alterations. At the lowest dose tested (6.25 microg), the inflammatory reaction was seen as multifocal perivascular infiltrates composed of granulocytes with occasional involvement of the vascular wall (@di$ vasculitis @/di$). At that dose, perivascular granulocyte infiltrates were mainly seen with @gm$ MSS @/gm$ (median score of 1.5/5). Mid (25 microg) and high (100 microg) archaea doses caused thickening of the alveolar septa by macrophages, mononuclear cells and type II pneumocytes. Thickening of the alveolar septa was always more severe with @gm$ MSS @/gm$ (scores from 2/5 to 3/5) compared to MBS-treated mice (scores from 0/5 to 1/5). @gm$ MSS @/gm$ also induced more severe peribronchiolar and/or perivascular mononuclear cellular infiltrate compatible with tertiary lymphoid organ formation (perivascular score: 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 for the 6.25, 25 and 100 microg @gm$ MSS @/gm$ doses, respectively). Thus, histological evaluation showed the ability of archaeal species to induce histopathological alterations in lungs with @gm$ MSS @/gm$ inducing more severe responses than MBS.	1
While the mean relative abundances of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ and A. vaginae were similar across study groups except prophylactic antibiotic users, the mean relative abundance of Prevotella and 'other BV-anaerobes' were significantly higher in post- than premenopausal controls and @di$ RUTI @/di$ cases (all comparisons p < 0.05; Supplement-1: Tables S1, S2). Streptococci were the most common Gram-positive uropathobionts across sample types and groups, but were significantly more common in urine and vaginal samples of post- than premenopausal controls and @di$ RUTI @/di$ cases (all comparisons p < 0.05; Supplement-1: Tables S1, S2). This was also the case for the much less relatively abundant Gram-positive uropathobionts Actinotignum schaalii and Aerococcus urinae and the Gram-negative uropathobionts Klebsiella and Pseudomonas. The mean relative abundances of Escherichia/Shigella in urine samples were not significantly different between post- and premenopausal controls (p = 0.737) or @di$ RUTI @/di$ cases (p = 0.979).	0
Within Methanobacteriota, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Candidatus Methanobrevibacter intestini, and the phylogenetically related Methanobrevibacter sp900766745 dominated the archaeome in most of the microbiomes, with the former two species dominating in ESP and ETH cohorts and Methanobrevibacter sp900766745 dominating in @di$ CHN @/di$, SWE and USA. Other species of Methanobacteriaceae, such as Methanosphaera cuniculi and Methanobrevibacter woesei were frequently identified across different archaeomes, in most cases with negligible amounts even though their abundance was higher in some samples (>1 %), especially belonging to the @di$ CHN @/di$ cohort. Within Thermoplasmatota, Methanomassiliicoccus_A MGYG000004312 was frequently identified with higher concentrations, in particular in samples from USA and SWE cohorts. Other species belonging to Methanomassiliicoccaceae or Methanomethylophilaceae were generally found in negligible concentration, except Methanomethylophilus alvi, @gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$ and Methanomethylophilaceae UBA71 sp900767505, that reached a concentration >1 % in the archaeome of few subjects.	0
Within the family Eggerthellaceae, the genus Adlercreutzia did not show an increase, while bacteria of the genus Asaccharobacter, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$, Enterorhabdus, and Paraeggerthella increased in abundance (Figure 3L). In particular, the bacteria species Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Assacharobacter WCA-131-CoC-2, @gm$ Eggerthella YY7918 @/gm$, and Enterorhabdus caecimuris were drivers of this increase (Figure S2C), which have been associated with inflammation and @di$ infection of the gastrointestinal tract @/di$.	1
World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommended intake of a specific dose of vegetable and fruits in daily food to prevent chronic pathologies such as hypertension, @di$ coronary heart problems @/di$, and risk of strokes. The consumers tend to prefer the foods and beverages which is fresh, highly nutritional, health promoting and ready to eat or ready to drink. Lactic acid (LA) fermentation of vegetables and fruits is a common practice to maintain and improve the nutritional and sensory features of food commodities. A great number of potential lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from various traditional naturally fermented foods. Asian traditional fermented foods are generally fermented by LAB such as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. pentosus, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. kimchi, L. fallax, Weissella confusa, W. koreenis, W. cibaria, and @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$, which are considered as the probiotic source of the food practice.	2
Yersiniosis caused by @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ is one of the most reported zoonoses in the EU with pigs being the most important reservoir. In humans, @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ causes gastroenteritis whereas the infection in pigs is asymptomatic. Most patients recover fully but the infection can lead to complications, such as @di$ septicaemia @/di$, reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.	1
aeruginosa @di$ infection @/di$ result in the activation of HRI, with S. flexneri inducing HRI activation leading to initiation of immune signalling as demonstrated by NF-kappaB activation and P. aeruginosa inducing HRI activation leading to increased host cell viability. Interestingly, during monospecies bacterial infection, HRI activation is required for @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ and Listeria monocytogenes to achieve their virulence associated intracellular activities, where a lack of HRI interferes with the pathogens T3SS virulence factors. In contrast, at an organismal level, HRI-deficient mice have been shown to be more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and less able to mount a system-level cytokine response. This suggests potentially different outcomes depending on whether @di$ infection @/di$ is monospecies or polymicrobial in nature, and hence, the exact role of HRI needs further attention. To date, HRI-specific inhibitors have been identified, and PERK inhibitors have already shown promise in combatting neurodegenerative diseases that impact upon the ISR. Greater understanding of the exact role of HRI in bacterial infection is therefore an area that may allow for the targetting of HRI as a novel antimicrobial therapy using inhibitors or activators in an @di$ infection @/di$-specific manner.	1
aeruginosa isolates, the global impact of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ on the P. aeruginosa RNI-responsive transcriptome is unclear. To better understand how @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and nitrite modulate the P. aeruginosa nitrosative stress response, we utilized RNA sequencing to determine how commensal-derived RNI modulate the P. aeruginosa RNI-responsive transcriptome in both an acute non-CF and a chronic CF isolate of P. aeruginosa. In this study, we report that @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ reduces the expression of several denitrification genes in the CF isolate compared to the acute isolate. However, the expression of nitric oxide reductase (norCB) was similarly upregulated in both the chronic and acute isolates, indicating that nitric oxide reductase is an essential component for P. aeruginosa tolerance to RNI. Due to this result, we hypothesized that loss of norCB may trigger @di$ hypersensitivity @/di$ to RNI in an acute isolate. Loss of norC and norB resulted in @di$ hypersensitivity @/di$ to @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$-mediated RNI in the acute isolate. Further, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ alone and with nitrite significantly decreased aconitase (an enzyme readily inactivated by RNI) activity in the acute background in the norB mutant, indicating that norB is critical for the P. aeruginosa nitrosative stress response. Finally, we demonstrate that clinical CF isolates are uniquely sensitive to @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ and nitrite-mediated RNI compared to acute or environmental isolates.	1

The administration of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum was found to be associated with a reduction of overall infections in critically ill patients treated with artificial nutrition by Kecskes et al., McNaught et al. and Klarin et al.. On the contrary, in 2008, Besselink et al. reported on the results of their study performed in 298 patients (mean age 60 years) with severe @di$ acute pancreatitis @/di$, and advised against administration of multispecies probiotic preparations containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium lactis given that higher mortality rates and bowel ischemia were registered among those patients.	0

All Burkholderia spp. possess an Ambler class A Pen beta-lactamase, which confers resistance to beta-lactams. The beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) is in clinical development for the treatment of Acinetobacter infections. In this study, we evaluated SUL-DUR for in vitro and in vivo activity against Burkholderia clinical isolates. We measured MICs of SUL-DUR against BCC and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ (n = 150), B. mallei (n = 30), and B. pseudomallei (n = 28), studied the kinetics of inhibition of the PenA1 beta-lactamase from B. multivorans and the PenI beta-lactamase from B. pseudomallei by durlobactam, tested for blaPenA1 induction by SUL-DUR, and evaluated in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of melioidosis.

Complicating conditions detected before death included malnutrition in 25 cases, pneumonia in 11 cases and @di$ septicemia @/di$ in 8 cases. In all 37 cases the colon showed gross colitis, consisting of mucosal erythema and edema; superficial ulcerations were visible in 15 cases. Microscopically in the colon the lamina propria showed inflammatory cellular infiltration in 27 cases and crypt abscesses were present in 22 cases. In 9 cases each there were colonic glands in the submucosa and branching of colonic crypts, indicating increased regenerative activity of crypt cells. Severe lesions were mucosal denudation and deep ulceration in 15 cases with a pseudomembrane in 7 and pseudopolyposis in 2 of these patients. The most common underlying cause of death was colitis, whereas the most common immediate and associated causes were, respectively, @di$ septicemia @/di$ and pneumonia. These results indicated that fatal childhood shigellosis results from severe colitis, often complicated by @di$ septicemia @/di$ and concomitant malnutrition and pneumonia.	1

The relative abundance ratio of R. faecis was fivefold lower in HESM versus HFD (0.0405, p = .0075) than in HFD versus CON (5.7825, p = .0143). Similarly, @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$ was significantly decreased in the HESM versus HFD group (0.5014, p = .0135) compared with HFD versus CON (1.9611, p = .0011). Additionally, B. hydrogenotrophica decreased from 2.8189 in HFD versus CON (p = .0032) to 0.5484 in HESM versus HFD (p = .0187). In contrast, the @di$ diabetes @/di$-related bacterium, S.	2

Septicemia due to @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ was identified in ten different species of psittacine birds. @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ was also detected frequently from feces of healthy psittacine birds, suggesting that this bacterium is a member of the normal intestinal flora of these birds. In this study, we present the first case of an isolated @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ in wound culture, which was identified in a patient who had traumatic tibia-fibula fracture after open reduction and fixation.	1
faecium has been shown to confer benefits to dogs with acute, uncomplicated @di$ diarrhea @/di$, with a better clinical outcome compared to a placebo. Bybee et al. (2011) have demonstrated the probiotic potential of E. faecium SF68  in preventing and treating @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in cats housed in animal shelters. However, the strain did not have significant effects on kennel stress-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in dogs, which may partially be due to the low prevalence of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in this study. In another study, the administration of a synbiotic containing E. faecium strain NCIMB 10,415 4b1707, plus the prebiotics fructooligosaccharides and gum Arabic, did not significantly alter fecal microbiota richness or diversity in dogs with or without food-responsive enteropathy (FRE). In addition, in dogs with FRE, E. faecium (DSM 10663/NCIMB 10415) E1707 as a single-strain treatment had no effect on the clinical activity score, histology scores, or duodenal and colonic gene expressions associated with specific T-helper lymphocyte lines. Promising preliminary results were obtained with a commercially available preparation containing inactivated cells of @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$, which reduced the number of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ episodes and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ severity in five out of six treated dogs with recurrent episodes of self-limiting @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	2

These include genes associated with the NF-kappaB pathway, ER stress, circadian rhythm, @di$ fibrosis @/di$-, and tumorigenesis.	1
harveyi and @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is noteworthy. In particular, @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is an opportunistic human pathogen, commonly found in warm coastal waters and in the Mediterranean Sea. It can cause severe gastroenteritis from the consumption of raw seafood, as well as @di$ wound infections @/di$ and necrotizing fasciitis, thus posing a health risk to both seafood consumers and fishermen. Infection due to this bacterial species in fish mainly consists of penetration of bacterium to the host tissue, mainly by the chemotactic activity, followed by deployment of the iron sequestering system and eventually damages the fish through extracellular products i.e., haemolysin and protease. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a seafood borne pathogen coming from the marine environment, is responsible for gastroenteritis, sepsis, or @di$ wound infection @/di$ in humans that are infected by eating contaminated raw seafood or @di$ wound-related infections @/di$.	1

Other species, such as H. haemolyticus and @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ have been considered as harmless respiratory tract commensals; however, evidence is accumulating that also strains of these species should be considered as opportunistic pathogens with the potential of causing a wide range of @di$ infections @/di$.	1
jejuni in human campylobacteriosis, research on @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ has largely been neglected. Moreover, the clinical symptoms induced by @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ are considered to be indistinguishable from those following C. jejuni infection. Given that our knowledge of mechanisms underlying @gm$ C. coli @/gm$-host interactions is rather scarce, we here investigated @gm$ C. coli @/gm$-induced campylobacteriosis in an established clinical murine @di$ infection @/di$ model. Our group recently showed that upon microbiota depletion by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, secondary abiotic IL-10-/- mice could not only be stably colonized by C. jejuni following peroral challenge but also presented with key features of acute campylobacteriosis seen in humans, such as wasting and bloody diarrhea within one week. The underlying mechanisms for these severe C. jejuni-induced immunopathological responses mounting in acute ulcerative enterocolitis were the abrogated colonization resistance following microbiota depletion, facilitating the establishment of the pathogen in the host's gastrointestinal tract, and furthermore, the lack of IL-10, enhancing the susceptibility of mice to C. jejuni LOS. Therefore, microbiota-depleted and C. jejuni-infected IL-10-/- mice display pronounced TLR4-dependent LOS-induced innate and adaptive immune responses that are not restricted to the intestinal tract but can also be observed in extra-intestinal, including systemic, compartments. Very recently, we were able to show that TLR4-deficient IL-10-/- mice carrying a human gut microbiota displayed less distinct immune responses upon peroral @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ infection as compared to IL-10-/- counterparts.	1

Determining isolate significance was difficult because most men had been started on presumptive TB treatment before isolate identification (70%). Histologic criteria were considered inappropriate for this high M. tuberculosis incidence population, particularly for patients who had stabilized on presumptive TB treatment.

lactis (107 CFU/g of powder formula) and BMOs (8 g/L of reconstituted formula) in healthy infants (n = 37 in the test formula group; n = 37 in the control group without supplementation) induced a fecal composition close to that observed in breastfed children (n = 39), particularly with a similar amount of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and an intermediate level of Bifidobacterium. Alpha diversity was lower in both the intervention group and breastfed infants than in the control group (significant difference up to 6 weeks, then at an intermediate level for the intervention group at 12 weeks). Moreover, the supplementation induced a microbiota shift toward a Bifidobacterium-dominated fecal microbiota. After 3 and 6 months of supplementation, Bifidobacteria and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ counts were higher in the stool of supplemented infants than in control group or breastfed infants. Stool pH and sIgA were intermediate in the intervention group. However, at 6 and 12 months of life, the proportions of infants who experienced at least one episode of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ or other febrile infection were similar among the three groups (test formula, n = 179; control formula, n = 180; breastfed, n = 59).	2
longum (NK46), @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$, and the mixture SLAB51 seem to be the most promising probiotics for @di$ AD @/di$, as they have shown the most positive outcomes. B. longum is an anaerobic, non-halophilic, gram-positive bacterium that is naturally present in the human GI tract. B. longum is considered safe by the EFSA. Although multiple health benefits have been found upon B. longum administration, such as diarrhea prevention in antibiotic treated patients, and immune stimulation, it is unclear why this probiotic is effective for @di$ AD @/di$ hallmarks in animal studies. A possible rationale is that B. longum (NK46) may stimulate the production of butyrate. Another hypothesis is that B. longum is associated with reduced intestinal inflammation and improved epithelial barrier integrity, and therefore decreases the passage of pro-inflammatory compounds through the BBB and reduces other potential adverse metabolic processes. B. longum is able to decrease gut microbiota LPS production as well as regulate LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in microglial BV-2 cells in @di$ AD @/di$ mice.	2

maltophilia, and @gm$ S. faecium @/gm$) and K. oxytoca B313 showed different effects on the @di$ infection @/di$ of D. antiqua larvae with B. bassiana. Specifically, neither the six bacterial strains nor K. oxytoca B313 affected the survival of axenic D. antiqua larvae (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). However, the six bacterial strains inhibited B. bassiana @di$ infection @/di$ of axenic D. antiqua larvae, while K. oxytoca B313 did not (Fig. 1). We confirmed that the six bacterial strains protect D. antiqua larvae by inhibiting the conidial germination (Fig. S2a) and mycelial growth (Fig. S2b) of B. bassiana, which is consistent with previous reports. Comparison of metabolomic data from the six bacterial strains and K. oxytoca B313 (Fig. 2) indicated that 10 types of metabolites, including glutaric acid, thymine, ethylmalonic acid, hypoxanthine, kynurenic acid, picolinic acid, ketoisocaproic acid, phenyllactic acid, adipic acid, and indoleacetic acid, were produced at different levels among the six bacteria compared to B313. These metabolites may be the bioactive chemicals that protect D. antiqua larvae from entomopathogenic @di$ infection @/di$.	2

Antibody levels to bacteria such as S. sanguis were modified during therapy. This would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be ""@di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$"" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process."	0

In this context, the demonstration that the Nlrc4 inflammasome accounts for restriction of in vivo infection by these species contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms by which host immune responses restrict infections by frequent @di$ pneumonia @/di$-causing bacteria such as L. micdadei and @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$.	1

In addition, Mitsou et al. showed that colonization patterns of A. muciniphila in a Greek adult population were associated with cardiometabolic markers and adiposity. In addition, in metagenomic results, we found that oat consumption could significantly increase the relative abundance of Dialister, @gm$ Butyrivibrio @/gm$, and Paraprevotella and decreased unclassified f-sutterellaceae at the genus level, showing some similarities to other dietary interventions rich in fiber and polyphenols, in which the authors all reported a reduction of TC and LDL-C upon the dietary interventions in healthy subjects and rodent models of metabolic disease.	2

To determine the phylogenetic positions of the clones of these forms within the context of the salmonellae of subspecies I, comparative data for 22 other common serovars were utilized. Except for S. paratyphi A and S. sendai, the analysis revealed no close phylogenetic relationships among clones of different human-adapted serovars, which implies convergence in host adaptation and virulence factors. Clones of S. miami are not allied with those of S. sendai or S. paratyphi A, being, instead, closely related to strains of S. panama. Clones of S. paratyphi B and S. java belong to a large phylogenetic complex that includes clones of S. typhimurium, S. heidelberg, S. saintpaul, and S. muenchen. Most strains of S. paratyphi B belong to a globally distributed clone that is highly polymorphic in biotype, bacteriophage type, and several other characters, whereas strains of S. java represent seven diverse lineages. The flagellar monophasic forms of S. java are genotypically more similar to clones of S. typhimurium than to other clones of S. java or S. paratyphi B. Clones of @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$ are related to those of S. choleraesuis. DNA probing with a segment of the viaB region specific for the Vi capsular antigen genes indicated that the frequent failure of isolates of @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$ to express Vi antigen is almost entirely attributable to regulatory processes rather than to an absence of the structural determinant genes themselves. Two clones of S. typhisuis are related to those of S. choleraesuis and @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$, but a third clone is not.	1

Moreover, Vogt et al., who characterized the taxonomic composition of fecal microbiota from 25 AD patients and found a decreased microbial diversity that is compositionally differed from age and sex matched subjects. Moreover, the genes wide differences were found, with decreased Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium, and increased Bacteroidetes in AD patients and these changes were strongly correlated with Abeta pathology and p-tau protein in the subgroup of patients. Elderly patients had no definitive AD, but had decrease in the abundance of anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ E. rectale and B. fragilis and increase in abundance of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ taxon Escherichia/Shigella with higher level of IL-1beta, CXCL2, NLRP3, and Abeta peptide as compared to healthy controls and subjects with cognitive impairment but had no Abeta pathology.	1

Among these, Faecalibacterim, Butyricimonas, and Alistipes are well-known SCFA-producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory commensal bacteria that play a role in IBD, obesity, appendectomy, and depression. Interestingly, a recently published clinical study reported that O. splanchnicus was a key strain that could promote both metabolism (producing SCFAs) and mucosal immunity (inducing regulatory T cells) and has protective effects against ulcerative colitis. The family Christensenellaceae, reported to be widespread and associated with human health, was depleted in individuals with CD, UC, and @di$ IBS @/di$.	2
subtilis endoglucanase Cel5, @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ exoglucanase Cel48, and C. thermocellum endoglucanase Cel9). Interestingly, similar to C. thermocellum that naturally displays a cellulosome, the recombinant B. subtilis cells exhibited cellulolytic @di$ CEM @/di$ synergy, as the activity of the surface-displayed complex was superior to a purified minicellulosome that contained the same enzymes; the cells degraded RAC and microcrystalline cellulose 2.3- and 4.5-fold better than the isolated complex, respectively. It was proposed that interactions between cells might also contribute to @di$ CEM @/di$ synergy as presumably adjacent cells can assimilate long-chain hydrolysis products before they diffuse into the bulk phase, which prevents product inhibition of the cellulases and cellulosomes.	0
thetaiotaomicron has also been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory properties, attenuating @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$ and reinforcing the intestinal barrier. In fact, @di$ gut inflammation @/di$ has been correlated with a reduction in the abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and other Bacteroides species, reinforcing the importance of a well-balanced gut microbiota composition for human health. In our analyses, B. thetaiotaomicron, like @gm$ R. bicirculans @/gm$, correlated with increases of acetate and butyrate, although it has so far only been described as an acetic acid producer. As mentioned above, this relationship could be explained by the fact that some gut bacteria can produce butyrate from acetate through the action of butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase. Recently, B. thetaiotaomicron has also been investigated for its interaction in co-culture with Phascolarctobacterium faecium. Even though P. faecium abundantly colonizes the human gut, its functional role is still to be determined. This taxon is unlikely to use carbohydrates for its development and rather uses succinate as a substrate, which is abundantly produced by B. thetaiotaomicron. Succinate is a known intermediate of SCFA production in the intestine and the utilization of succinate by P. faecium in co-culture with B. thetaiotaomicron resulted in the production of propionate. However, in our analyses P. faecium rather correlated negatively with acetate. In the case of B. uniformis, we detected a positive correlation only with butyrate, which has also been recently demonstrated by. Moreover, these authors proposed a direct effect on the increase of TRL5 expression. The activation of TLR5 contributed to curbing the spread of the @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cascade from the intestine toward peripheral tissues in obese mice.	2
thompson, @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$, S. enteridis, S. infantis, S. haardt, and S. typhimurium, which was similar to other finding. Isolation of invasive serotypes such as S. typhimurium indicates the public health significance and may pose health hazards, especially if chicken is consumed undercooked or cross-contamination occurs in kitchen during the meal preparation. The dominated serotype was S. thampson, which might be due to cross-contamination during product handling and distribution. Infection with S. thampson causes diarrhea, @di$ nausea @/di$ and vomiting in humans as well as several diseases in immune-compromised individuals.	1
tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, @gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$ and Mycobacterium marinum from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were used as standard control for PCR/REPA. Eight cases of foreign body granuloma, seven normal skin samples from the margin of surgical excisions and 5 cases of @di$ dermatitis @/di$ were used as negative controls, and 4 cases of cutaneous tuberculosis were used as positive controls. Mycobacterial DNA was detected by PCR in 16 of the 20 cases of sarcoidosis. PCR/REPA subtyped 8 of these to M. tuberculosis complex (2 cases), M. avium-intracellulare (4 cases), @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ (2 cases) while the other 8 cases were non-tuberculous mycobacteria.	1
vaginalis bacteremia cases were noted in men with chronic alcohol use, immunosuppression, transurethral prostatectomy, @di$ nephrolithiasis @/di$/urolithiasis, urethral stenting, or stricture. There are still no established guidelines defining the treatment of extra-vaginal Gardnerella infections. However, most reported cases were treated with metronidazole in combination with other antimicrobial agents as penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone. The total duration of antimicrobial treatment for @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$ bacteremia in the setting of urinary tract disease was between 10-14 days in most of the reported cases.	1
