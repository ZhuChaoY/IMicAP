(2005) reported an increase of B cells instead of T cells in gingivitis lesions in an experimental model of @di$ gingivitis @/di$. Mahanonda et al. (2016) found memory B cells in the gums of patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$, suggesting previous activation by periodontal microorganisms. In another study, B cells in response to a bacterium associated with periodontal disease in vivo led to upregulation of RANKL expression. Gemmell et al. (2002) found that BALB/c mice co-infected with @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and P.	1
(FDR=0.042) were significantly enriched in MHO groups, whereas Butyrivibrio crossotus (B.crossotus) (FDR<0.001), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F.prausnitzii) (FDR=0.007), @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ (@gm$ B.cellulosilyticus @/gm$) (FDR=0.005), Eubacterium siraeum (E.siraeum) (FDR<0.001), and Bacteroides massiliensis (FDR=0.024) were significantly enriched in non-@di$ obese @/di$ controls ( Figure 2C ,  Table S5 ). A random forest model was established to identify the top 50 important biomarkers to differentiate MHO from non-@di$ obese @/di$ controls.	2
(R = -0.582) raised the question of whether administration by @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ could inhibit pathogenic Desulfovibrio and Pseudomonas. Indeed, bifidobacterial species, like B. longum, had been reported to be able to successfully treat ulcerative colitis with multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in a man and prevent gut-derived pseudomonas aeruginosa @di$ sepsis @/di$ in mice.	2
(dysentery), Staphylococcus aureus (abscesses, folliculitis, boils, impetigo, wound infections), Streptococcus faecalis (urinary tract infections), Streptococcus mutans (dental caries), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sinusitis), (ear infections, impetigo, puerperal fever, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, sore throat, wound infections), @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ (cholera), Actinomyces pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Nocardia asteroids, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agal., dysgal., uber (mastitis), Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum, T. tonsurans, T. mentagrophytes var.

(for example, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus and @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$) cause vibriosis - infections normally acquired through exposure to sea water or through consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated seafood. Non-cholera bacteria can lead to several clinical manifestations, most commonly mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, with the exception of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, an opportunistic pathogen with a high mortality that causes wound infections that can rapidly lead to @di$ septicaemia @/di$. Treatment for Vibrio spp. infection largely depends on the causative pathogen: for example, rehydration therapy for V. cholerae infection and debridement of infected tissues for @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$-associated wound infections, with antibiotic therapy for severe cholera and systemic infections.	1
0.80) with a decreasing degree of polymerization, which implied that the potential anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ prebiotic effect was enhanced. At the genus level, hydrolyzed TSPs maintained similar roles as native TSP, including promoting beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, and Faecalibacterium) and inhibiting enteropathogenic bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Dorea). Moreover, ETSP1 had additional potential due to abundant Bacteroides vulgatus (LDA = 4.68), and ETSP2 might perform better as related to @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ (LDA = 4.40).	2
1F and 2B), sgRNAs that targeted acetogenesis-related genes, including those that encode formate dehydrogenase, the @di$ W-L @/di$ pathway, hydrogenase, the Rnf complex, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthase, were depleted under all growth conditions as the passage progressed from P1 to P3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Among them, genes encoding methyl branch, carbonyl branch, phosphotransacetylase, and acetate kinase were essential, even under glucose conditions (Fig. 3A). These findings were consistent with the high translation level of hydrogenase, the Rnf complex, ATP synthase, and the @di$ W-L @/di$ pathway under glucose conditions, as previously reported. To confirm heterotrophic growth repression, we constructed two CRISPRi mutants (Fig. 3B), folD and acsB. The growth rate and maximum biomass (OD600) of folD in the methyl-branch and acsB in the carbonyl-branch mutants were significantly decreased under heterotrophic (growth rate, 0.74- to 0.80-fold decrease, P < 0.018; maximum biomass, 0.49- to 0.67-fold decrease, P < 0.004) and autotrophic growth conditions (growth rate, 0.18- to 0.20-fold decrease, P < 0.003; maximum biomass, 0.64- to 0.67-fold decrease, P < 0.008). These data indicated that the @di$ W-L @/di$ pathway significantly contributes to the heterotrophic growth of @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$.	0
2f), @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, Alistipes shahii and Roseburia intestinalis (Fig. 2g) demonstrated significant stroke-induced elevation in abundance. Interestingly, all of these species are relatively novel and were recently (after 2002) first described. P. goldsteinii is a novel anaerobe, recently characterised as pathogen identified in a few studies as a causing agent of @di$ sepsis @/di$ and abdominal abscess. Similarly, @gm$ A. colihominis @/gm$ was first isolated and described in 2004 and implicated as pathogen 2 years later.	1
30/76 (39.5%) neonates with clinical @di$ sepsis @/di$ had a positive PCR result (ConS: n = 24, Streptococcus sp.: n = 2). The two episodes with Streptococcus sp. had a maximum CRP at 4.2 and 4.6 mg/dL, respectively. A polymicrobial @di$ sepsis @/di$ with ConS, E. faecalis, K. oxytoca and @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ was detected in one episode with a maximum CRP at 10.5 mg/dL. A further episode presented with K. pneumonia and E. coli with a CRP of 19.5 mg/dL; two more episodes of clinical @di$ sepsis @/di$ without yield of a causative agent in conventional blood culture but positive PCR signal were caused by E.	1
3A, in BMI groups within the genus level, Dialister, Akkermansia, @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$, and Alistipes exhibited a significant decrease in @di$ AW @/di$ children compared with Lean children. At the species level, Megamonas hypermegale was increased in the @di$ AW @/di$ group, while Akkermansia muciniphila, Dialister invisus, Alistipes putredinis, Bacteroides massiliensis, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were decreased in @di$ AW @/di$ children compared to the Lean group (Fig.	2
4c), the NAE most significantly enriched in PRISM and iHMP @di$ IBD @/di$ subjects (Fig. 2; Supplementary Dataset 2). Abundances of Alistipes and Bacteroides species decreased upon treatment with all NAEs except PEA (Fig. 4c), reflecting our monoculture observations (Fig. 3b; Extended Data 3, 4) and Bacteroidetes depletion in PRISM and iHMP @di$ IBD @/di$ subjects. @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$, also underrepresented in PRISM @di$ IBD @/di$ subjects, was inhibited by AEA, LEA, and NAE-mix in the complex community. In contrast, Escherichia spp. abundances increased with AEA, LEA and NAE-mix, again mirroring our observations in monocultures and @di$ IBD @/di$ patients.	2
@di$ Anorexia @/di$ status was characterized by an altered intestinal microbiota composition, with unbalanced Gram positive/Gram negative relative abundance. The microbiota of AN subjects was enriched in Bacteroidetes and depleted in Firmicutes, thus showing an opposite trend compared with what described in obese subjects. In particular, the relative abundance of the carbohydrate-fermenter Ruminococcus, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Clostridium genera, belonging to Firmicutes, was decreased in AN. This is in agreement with previous data, and supports the significantly lower fecal butyrate concetration assessed in AN subjects. @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp., such as R. faecis, @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$, R.	2
@di$ Bacteremia @/di$ due to Campylobacter spp. is rarely reported, and @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$ is the species most commonly exhibiting vascular tropism, as occurred in this case report describing the diagnosis of C. fetus bacteremia in an infant presenting with respiratory tract infection. A 5-month-old baby, with undiagnosed failure to thrive, presented to the acute care service with a high fever and respiratory symptoms of 2 days duration. The initial clinical and laboratory diagnosis suggested @di$ bacteremia @/di$, but there was difficulty with recovery and identification of the organism from blood. Subsequent laboratory testing confirmed @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ as the etiological agent. @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ isolated from blood culture bottles may give atypical laboratory features, rendering its identification challenging.	1
@di$ CD @/di$ patients were characterised by higher abundances of Eggerthella, Coriobacteriaceae bacterium phi, Dialister succinatiphilus and R. torques which were found, and lower abundances of Bacteroides massiliensis and Butyrivibrio crossotus (phylum: Firmicutes) compared to healthy controls (Figure 2C). MD patients were characterised by higher abundances of P. copri, Ruminococcus gnavus and Megamonas hypermegale, and lower abundances of Bacteroides eggerthii, @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ and Clostridium sp.	2
@di$ Caries @/di$ status and dmft indices were the top two factors in defining the absolute abundance of those selected species, yet factors like age, gender and geographic origin did not influence the bacteria levels significantly. This suggested that even the individuals were from different background, disease status could still discriminate the @di$ S-ECC @/di$ community structures from H groups. Interestingly, in healthy children, there were very strong positive correlations between two of the four targeted strains. In contrast, in children with @di$ S-ECC @/di$, the very strong positive correlation between S. mutans and L. fermentum found in the healthy children was significantly weakened, and the very strong positive correlation between S. mutans and @gm$ P. denticola @/gm$ found in the healthy children was even disappeared. This finding was consistent to our former result that healthy microbiomes were more conversed, while those @di$ caries @/di$ microbiomes were more diversely distributed. For the healthy group, as they were more resembled, so we were able to detect more consistence in the close relationship of those bacterial members among this group. However, for the @di$ caries @/di$ group, a shifted balance of microbiota takes place in the oral environment, where any bacterial members with the ability of acid-producing and acid-resisting could potentially initiate the occurrence of @di$ caries @/di$. This might be a potential explanation for that on the links between the levels of chose bacterial members especially between those acknowledged @di$ caries @/di$-leading bacteria like S. mutans and L. fermentum, S. mutans and P. pallens were weaken or disappeared in the @di$ S-ECC @/di$ group.	1
@di$ Crohn's disease @/di$ and ulcerative colitis are accompanied by seronegative arthritis in about one fifth of the cases. In the present study, cell wall fragments from major residents such as @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$, Coprococcus and Peptostreptococcus species, isolated from the faecal flora of patients with @di$ Crohn's disease @/di$, were tested for properties to induce chronic arthritis in Lewis rats. Cell wall fragments from @gm$ Eubacterium contortum @/gm$ strains Me44 and Me47 were found to induce chronic arthritis; Peptostreptococcus productus strain C 18 cell wall fragments induced acute self-limiting arthritis.	1
@di$ D-Lactic acidosis @/di$: (3) @di$ D-Lactic acidosis @/di$ was reported in a five-year-old girl with SBS receiving Lactomin (L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, Streptococcus faecalis and @gm$ S. faecium @/gm$) suspected to be caused by L. acidophilus, which improved after discontinuation of the probiotics. (4) Ku et al. reported the case of a five-year-old boy with SBS who developed recurrent episodes of @di$ D-Lactic acidosis @/di$ while on treatment with a probiotic capsule containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis, which resolved when enteral feeds were interrupted.	1
@di$ Dental caries @/di$ is initiated by demineralization of the tooth surface due to the action of organic acid formed by dental plaque bacteria, arising from their fermentation of dietary carbohydrates. After fermentable carbohydrate intake, the plaque pH may decrease below the critical pH of 5.5, at which point human enamel undergoes demineralization, within minutes, and may remain acidified for several minutes up to several hours. This rapid acidification may not only cause demineralization of tooth surface but also temporarily inhibit bacterial growth in the oral biofilm. Thus, a high level of inherent acid tolerance appears to be crucial for the cariogenicity of oral microorganisms. When the intracellular pH maintained by @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ under varying external pH conditions was experimentally compared to those of other @di$ caries @/di$-associated oral bacteria, such as Str.	1
@di$ Dental caries @/di$ is one of the most prevalent diseases and affects quality of life also. Streptococcus mutans and @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ are the organisms which are responsible for initiation and progression of it. Natural phytochemicals can be an effective alternative to antibiotics and represent a promising approach in the prevention of @di$ dental caries @/di$ and other oral infection.	1
@di$ Dental caries @/di$ or @di$ tooth decay @/di$ is a common and chronic infectious disease in children and different types of bacteria have been introduced as @di$ caries @/di$-producing microorganisms . In this respect, @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ (@gm$ S. mutans @/gm$) is known as the most important microorganism observed at the onset of decay; however, Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) is the most frequent one affecting progression of @di$ dental caries @/di$ .	1
@di$ Enteric fever @/di$ is a systemic illness caused by Salmonella infection, with S. typhi, @gm$ S. paratyphi @/gm$, and S. enteritidis being the most common serotypes. Humans are the only reservoir for S. typhi, and its predilection for the ileum is due to the fact that organisms enter the body by translocation across specialized Peyer's patch epithelium and then proliferate in the mucosal macrophages. The lesions in bowel and mesenteric lymph nodes are distinctive and mimic Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and Rosai-Dorfman disease as well as infections caused by some non-salmonella bacteria. The four cases presented in this report, two culture-confirmed, all exhibited ileal mucosal hypertrophy caused by a neutrophil-poor monocyte/macrophage-rich hyperplasia. Though diffuse areas were present, much of the lesional proliferation was nodular, representing macrophage infiltration and colonization by the monocytes and macrophages. Immunophenotypic studies, which showed a CD68+, lysozyme+, UCHL-1+, OPD4-, CD4-, s100- profile, were helpful in distinguishing these lesions from other processes, including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and Rosai-Dorfman disease. Although rare in developed countries, @di$ enteric fever @/di$ should be considered in any patient with recent travel to endemic areas and in the context of illness thought to be related to contaminated foods.	1
@di$ Frontal osteomyelitis @/di$ is a rare complication of sinusitis. Common intracranial complications of the @di$ frontal osteomyelitis @/di$ are meningitis, epidural empyema, subdural empyema and brain abscess. We described a case of @di$ frontal osteomyelitis @/di$ with brain abscess caused by @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ with improve after needle aspiration and antibiotics to brain abscess for eight weeks and for chronic @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ for four months.	1
@di$ Hyperactive serine protease @/di$ responses appear to be responsible for increased desquamation of the skin, altered cathelicidin, and inflammation. @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ serine proteases were directly linked to AD severity, and therefore, this dysbiosis was recovered after treatment. Analysis of skin microbiome in our 2 patients also demonstrated low diversity and high @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ loading, suggesting that the microbial landscape of skin may be related to skin immunity and AD.	1
@di$ Hypertension @/di$ is an independent and preventable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, however, little is known about the impact of gut microbiota composition in its development. We carried out comprehensive gut microbiota analysis and targeted metabolomics in a cross-sectional study of 29 non-treated @di$ hypertensive @/di$ (@di$ HT @/di$) and 32 normotensive (NT) subjects. We determined fecal microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial functions by metagenomic analysis. The microbial metabolites analysed were short chain fatty acids (SCFA) both in plasma and feces, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in plasma. The overall bacterial composition and diversity of bacterial community in the two groups were not significantly different. However, Ruminococcaceae NK4A214, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Christensenellaceae_R-7, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$ were found to be significantly enriched in NT group, whereas, Bacteroides coprocola, Bacteroides plebeius and genera of Lachnospiraceae were increased in @di$ HT @/di$ patients. We found a positive correlation between the @di$ HT @/di$-associated species and systolic and diastolic blood pressure after adjusted for measured confounders. SCFA showed antagonistic results in plasma and feces, detecting in @di$ HT @/di$ subjects significant higher levels in feces and lower levels in plasma, which could indicate a less efficient SCFA absorption. Overall, our results present a disease classifier based on microbiota and bacterial metabolites to discriminate @di$ HT @/di$ individuals from NT controls in a first disease grade prior to drug treatment.	2
@di$ IBD @/di$ is associated with well-described extra-intestinal complications, including at environmental interfaces of the skin and oral mucosa. We report an increase in prevalence of vulvovaginal symptoms in @di$ IBD @/di$, but the mechanism of these symptoms is not described. We hypothesized that patient characteristics leading to an impaired host-microbe relationship in the gut in patients with @di$ IBD @/di$ might influence the microbiota in other mucosae, such as the vaginal mucosa. Compared to bacterial communities at other body sites, the diversity of microbial species in the vagina is limited; in many healthy women @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species make up over 90% of the microbial community. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ dominance is associated with favorable reproductive outcomes, including decreased rates of prematurity, vaginitis, genital inflammation, and risk of HIV acquisition.	2
"@di$ Infection @/di$ involving either fever, chills, sore lymph nodes and pus occurred following removal of five third molars, which were treated sufficiently with antibiotics involving phenoxymethylpenicillin 800 mg (Primcillin  - Meda A/@gm$ S; Ballerup @/gm$, Denmark) four times a day and metronidazole 500 mg (Metronidazol ""DAK"" - Takeda Pharma A/S; Hobro, Denmark) two times a day for seven days."	0
@di$ Infections @/di$ may lead to reproductive failure and abortion in animals and a feverish multiorgan disease in humans. Up to now, 12 species were allocated to the genus Brucella (Godfroid et al.,). Six of them, B. melitensis, B. abortus, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$, B.	1
@di$ MHEICT @/di$ versus not: Similar to PHES, no changes in alpha-diversity was seen and PERMANOVA of borderline significance (p = .08; Figure 3) was seen for beta-diversity. On MAAsLin2, most bacterial species in the top 30 were negatively linked to @di$ MHEICT @/di$ with the majority of these belonging to Enterococcus, Veillonella, Clostridia and Ruminococcacae spp. Dakarella massiliensis was the only microbe linked to MHE-ICT in the top 30 (Table 3 and Table S2). Remaining microbes associated with @di$ MHEICT @/di$ were Alistipes ihumii, @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$, Prevotella copri, Eubacterium spp., and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.	2
@di$ Multiple sclerosis @/di$ is a chronic neurological disorder that impairs the central nervous system through swelling and neural tissue damage. Probiotics may play a key role in the rehabilitation of microbial and immune balance in @di$ MS @/di$ subjects. Clinical studies focused on @di$ MS @/di$ treatment with probiotics are comparatively fewer compared to those on other autoimmune disorders. The intervention with probiotic capsules (L. acidophilus, L. casei, @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$, and Lactobacillus fermentum) to 60 @di$ MS @/di$ patients decreased inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and plasma nitric oxide metabolites.	2
@di$ Obesity @/di$ is a major global lifestyle disorder associated with gut microbiota. The health benefits of eggshell membrane (ESM) have been shown in previous reports, particularly as regards gut microbiota composition. Here, we investigated whether ESM improves lipid metabolism and alters gut microbiota in high-fat diet-fed mice. A total of 20 C57BL/6J mice aged 6 weeks were given either a control diet (CON), high-fat diet (HFD), or high-fat diet + 8% ESM powder (HESM) for 20 weeks. ESM supplementation in HFD-fed mice reduced plasma triglycerides (TG) and liver total cholesterol (TC) and upregulated the expression of lipid metabolism genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2. Microbiota analysis showed increased relative abundance of the anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ bacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri, at 4, 12, and 16 weeks and reduced the abundance of inflammation-related Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Roseburia faecis, and @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ at 12 and 20 weeks. ESM-supplemented mice had increased cecal isobutyrate, negatively correlated with B. hydrogenotrophica and Parabacteroides goldsteinii abundance. The results indicate that ESM supplementation in HFD-fed mice reduced plasma TG and liver TC, possibly through alteration of lipid metabolism gene expression and gut microbiota composition, suggesting that ESM may be effective in @di$ obesity @/di$ management.	2
@di$ Obesity @/di$ is related to chronic inflammation. Our data demonstrated that ESM supplementation may attenuate the inflammatory condition, as evidenced by the reduced B. hydrogenotrophica and @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$ abundance at 20 weeks of intervention. Consistent with our findings, high abundance of Blautia has been detected in patients with conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases and inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS; Rigsbee et al., 2012). The abundance of another member of the phylum Firmicutes, Roseburia faecis, decreased in the ESM group, which is consistent with a prospective cohort study in @di$ obese @/di$ postmenopausal women receiving a very low-calorie diet. Furthermore, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ and Roseburia species, which were significantly altered in the present study, have been linked to enhanced production of SCFAs (Aleman et al., 2018).	2
@di$ Odontogenic infections @/di$ are typically of endodontic or periodontal origin. In acute apical abscesses, the most prevalent Prevotella taxa include P. multisaccharivorax, P. intermedia, P. baroniae, and A. tannerae, as well as occasional recoveries of P. oralis and P. nigrescens. Significant variations in the microbiome can be, at least in part, explained by geographic/ethnic differences; for example, P. nigrescens, A. tannerae, and F. nucleatum were more prevalent in endodontic abscess samples from the USA than in those from Brazil. Of the 138 clinical strains isolated from periodontal abscesses, the majority represented Prevotella taxa. Of those, 1/3 were identified as P. intermedia, and around 1/10 as P. nigrescens, P. melaninogenica, @gm$ P. dentalis @/gm$, P. denticola, and P. buccae . Occasional recoveries included P. fusca, P. histicola, P. multiformis, P. oris, P. oulorum, P. pallens, P. salivae, P. veroralis, and A. rava. Recently, the microbiome compositions between abscess pus and the corresponding periodontal pocket (coronally from the abscess) and periodontally healthy gingival crevice samples were compared. Based on the beta-diversity analyses, periodontal abscess pus and the periodontal pocket shared similar compositions. In comparison to the healthy gingival crevice, P. intermedia and P. heparinolytica, together with P. gingivalis, were the predominant findings and significantly more abundant in periodontal abscesses. In 50 German patients hospitalized for severe odontogenic abscesses, the frequency of Prevotella was 17.7% in saliva (collected prior to the abscess incision) and 27.2% in the pus samples, being the most abundant genus in odontogenic abscesses. In spreading @di$ odontogenic infections @/di$, members of the genus Prevotella are common, especially P.	1
@di$ PPMs @/di$ periodically showing the same molecular profile using pulse field gel electrophoresis were considered long-term persistent. Bronchial colonisation was observed in 56 out of 79 follow-up examinations (70.9%) and was mainly due to Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria (n = 47). These @di$ PPMs @/di$ were all related to sputum neutrophilia (p< or =0.05, Chi-squared test), and H. influenzae was related to higher levels of IL-1beta (p = 0.005) and IL-12 (p = 0.01), with a dose-response relationship (Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.38 for IL-1beta (p = 0.001), and of 0.32 for IL-12 (p = 0.006)). @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ was not associated with an identifiable inflammatory response. Long-term persistence of the same strain was observed in 12 examinations (21.4%), mainly due to P. aeruginosa or enterobacteria. A neutrophilic bronchial inflammatory response was associated with a statistically significant decline in FEV(1) during follow-up (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.07-6.62). A load-related relationship to bronchial inflammation in moderate COPD was observed for colonisation by H. influenzae, but not for colonisation by @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$.	0
@di$ Pelvic osteomyelitis @/di$ is unusual in children. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with this infection seen at our institution. From 1998 to 2005, 31 patients with @di$ pelvic osteomyelitis @/di$ were identified: 19 males and 12 females with an age range of 1.5 months to 17 years 9 months. Duration of illness prior to admission ranged from 1 day to 2.5 months. Chief complaints included nonspecific pain, fever, limp, and decreased weight bearing. Microorganisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, and Kingella kingae. Bones involved were acetabulum/ilium (22 patients), ischium (7 patients), and pubis (4 patients); 2 patients had several bones involved. Imaging studies performed included magnetic resonance imaging (21 patients), computed tomography (14 patients), and nuclear bone scan (25 patients). Our study, the largest contemporary series of @di$ pediatric pelvic osteomyelitis @/di$ from one institution, highlights the consequences of prolonged duration of illness and delayed diagnosis.	1
@di$ Periodontitis @/di$ associated species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella nigrescens were exclusively detected in RA and PsA. Mean number (+/- SD) of oral bacterial species in SF were 14.0 (6.8) in the RA (p = 0.001) and 19.4 (7.1) in the PsA group (p < 0.001) compared to 4.0 (1.7) in controls. P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ were exclusively identified in RA and PsA SF.	1
@di$ Periodontitis @/di$ is a bacterial-induced inflammatory disease where teeth progressively lose their supporting tissues. Several population-based studies have shown increased incidence of @di$ periodontitis @/di$ with age starting from 35 years-old with high potential over the age of 65. We hypothesized that the presence of periodontopathic bacteria may affect AAA. We assumed that the infectious factor may increase the local inflammation and consequently the tissue degradation and also the healing process in our model. Therefore we have analysed thoroughly four main @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ (Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ (@gm$ Td @/gm$), Tannerella forsythia (Tf) and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) belonging to the red and orange complexes (Socransky et al.).	1
@di$ Periodontitis @/di$ is a polymicrobial chronic inflammatory disease of tooth-supporting tissues with bacterial etiology affecting all age groups, becoming chronic in a subgroup of older individuals. Periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ are implicated in the development of a number of inflammatory pathologies at remote organ sites, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).	1
@di$ Protein and energy malnutrition @/di$, anemia, being very young and climatic factors (harmattan and rainy seasons) were identified as major risk factors. The three main bacteria identified were Staphylococcus aureus (21 cases), @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ (19 cases) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 cases).	1
@di$ Smoking @/di$ and drinking are the two famous living habits for GC risk, and bile reflux and inflammatory activity are the two pathologic factors driving the progression of nCAG to CAG/GC. Several studies proved that @di$ smoking @/di$ and drinking could alter the gastrointestinal microbiota. found that smoking distinctly altered the duodenal microbiota, but quitters and non-smokers occupied similar duodenal microbiota, suggesting that living habits-induced microbial alteration is plastic and reversible. found that the exposure of cigarette @di$ smoking @/di$ could increase the incidence of colorectal cancer in mice, accompanied with the absence of gut Parabacteroides distasonis and Lactobacillus spp., and the increased Eggerthella lenta was positively related to the fecal taurine deoxycholic acid (TDCA), which could in turn activate the intestinal epithelial MAPK/ERK pathway. Meanwhile, cigarette @di$ smoking @/di$ could reduce the expressive levels of intestinal mucosal junction protein-3 and ZO-1, but increase the serum LPS level, leading to intestinal barrier damage and colorectal cancer. found that the occurrence of alcoholic fatty liver was associated with altered gut microbiota, while found that the long-chain saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid) in Jinhua ham could prevent chronic alcohol-associated liver damage (ALD), and the preventive effect was associated with increased gut Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus. found that @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ could degrade the cumulative nicotine in the intestine, and prevent the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the relationship between @di$ smoking @/di$/drinking and gastric microbiota is still unclear in the occurrence of CAG.	2
@di$ Stroke @/di$ (@di$ ST @/di$), endangering human health due to its high incidence and high mortality, is a global public health problem. There is increasing evidence that there is a link between the gut microbiota (GM) and neuropsychiatric diseases. We aimed to find the GM of @di$ ST @/di$, post-@di$ ST @/di$ cognitive impairment (PSCI), and post-@di$ ST @/di$ affective disorder (PSTD). GM composition was analyzed, followed by GM identification. Alpha diversity estimation showed microbiota diversity in @di$ ST @/di$ patients. Beta diversity analysis showed that the bacterial community structure segregated differently between different groups. At the genus level, @di$ ST @/di$ patients had a significantly higher proportion of @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ and lower content of Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Megamonas. PSCI patients had a significantly higher content of @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$, Bacteroides, and Escherichia-Shigella and a lower proportion of Faecalibacterium compared with patients with @di$ ST @/di$. Patients with PSTD had a significantly higher content of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella and lower content of @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ and Faecalibacterium. Parabacteroides and Lachnospiraceae were associated with Montreal cognitive assessment score of @di$ ST @/di$ patients.	1
@di$ Urinary tract infection @/di$ (@di$ UTI @/di$) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. It is more prevalent among females with an incidence rate 50-fold higher among the 20-50 years age group. There are various clinical manifestations of @di$ UTI @/di$ such as cystitis, pyelonephritis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, chronic and recurrent UTIs; of which cystitis is the most frequent presentation affecting the urinary bladder. The bacteria may further ascend in the urinary tract causing infection of the kidney; if timely management is not done. Majority cases of uncomplicated @di$ UTI @/di$ are community-acquired in origin and caused by uropathogenic   E. coli   (UPEC) and   Klebsiella   spp., constituting approximately 75-95 % of the total cases. The other less prevalent organisms are   Proteus   spp.,   Enterobacter   spp.,   Pseudomonas   spp.,   @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$  ,   Staphylococcus saprophyticus   and   Staphylococcus aureus  . Diagnosis is made based on the presenting symptoms and significant bacteriuria, i.e. >=105 colony forming units of organism on culture. The outcome of @di$ UTI @/di$ may also depend upon the presence of underlying host factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury and urinary catheterization among various others.	1
@di$ Vaginitis @/di$ Plus NuSwab  (LabCorp, NC, USA) is a semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the three most predictive marker organisms in BV, A. vaginae, @gm$ BVAB-2 @/gm$, and Megasphaera-1.	0
@di$ X- @/di$linked CGD results from mutations in the cytochrome b-245 heavy chain catalytic subunit (also known as gp91phox or NOX2 and coded by CYBB), and accounts for approximately 70% of CGD cases, The most common form of autosomal recessive CGD results from mutations in the regulatory protein NCF1 (coded by NCF1 and also known as p47phox), and accounts for 20% of CGD cases. Knocking out Cybb or Ncf1 (the latter referred to as Ncf1-/-) generated mouse models of CGD that showed increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections compared to wild type (wt) mice. Spontaneous bacterial and fungal infections occurred in Ncf1-/- mice, with soft tissue infections by @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ being the most common.	1
@di$ capsici infection @/di$ defined the chemical space of major classes of reprogrammed metabolites as comprising of phenylpropanoids, benzoic acids, glycoalkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids. In the present study, untargeted and targeted metabolomics approaches based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detection (UHPLC-MS) were combined to study the inducible metabolic responses of tomato plants (pre-primed with @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ N04 and Paenibacillus alvei T22) and subsequently challenged with Ph.	2
@gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ is known to be a member of the skin flora. @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$, the species associated with an increased RAS risk, has been isolated from clinical samples in association with bacteremia. R. gnavus is a member of the gut flora. Interestingly, an increase in R. gnavus in the gut flora is associated with Crohn's disease. In the salivary microbiota of RAS patients, the decrease in S. salivarius and the increase in Capnocytophaga sputigena were common to the changes observed in the mucosal microbiota. Capnocytophaga is normally found in the oral cavity but considered as an opportunistic pathogen involved in various infections, including endodontic infections, @di$ emphysema @/di$, and bacteremia. Collectively, these results indicate decreases in the members of healthy core microbiota but increases in rare species in the mucosal and salivary microbiota of RAS patients. Particularly, a decrease in S. salivarius and an increase in @gm$ A. johnsonii @/gm$ in the mucosa were associated with increased RAS risk.	0
@gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ extracellularly produces various virulence factors such as cytolysins, enterotoxins, and proteases. It is thought that these factors act in concert with each other to increase the pathogenicity of @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$. We purified a 65-kDa @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ serine protease (ASP) from the culture supernatant and clarified its crystal structure. The overall structure of ASP is closely related to that of Kex2, a member of the kexin family of subtilases expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We further observed that ASP induces vascular leakage, reduces blood pressure by activating the kallikrein/kinin system, promotes human @di$ plasma coagulation @/di$ via the activation of prothrombin, and causes the formation of pus and edema through the action of anaphylatoxin C5a. ASP thus exerts a variety of effects on biological components and is deeply involved in the pathogenicity of @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ belongs to the group of strictly anaerobic gram-negative cocci. All previously described @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. An A. fermentans strain (RYC-MR95) resistant to penicillin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (amoxicillin and cefotaxime MICs, 64 microgram/ml) was isolated from a human @di$ perianal abscess @/di$.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is a gram-negative coccobacillus, which naturally inhabits water and soil as well as pets, arthropods, and food animals. In humans, it can colonize skin, wounds, respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts as well as oral mucosa, predisposing to pneumonia in the event of aspiration into the lower respiratory tract. Certain @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species account for some healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia, central line-associated @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, and surgical site infections. @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ is one species that is rarely reported to be a human infection. In this study, we presented a case of an isolated @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ in urine culture, which was identified in a patient who had a left nephrostomy tube placement with prior antibiotic use.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species are opportunistic pathogens causing nosocomial infections . Relatively few infections caused by @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. are community-acquired, reported primarily from countries with tropical or subtropical climate, and mainly affected patients with some form of comorbidity or associated with heavy smoking and excess alcohol consumption . Clinical forms of Acinetobacter infections include mainly the respiratory tract, blood-stream infections, peritoneum, urinary tract infection, surgical wounds, @di$ meningitis @/di$, skin and soft tissue infections and eye infections.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. was cultured from eight donkeys (8/14, 57.1%) with vulvar discharge and four donkeys (4/16, 25%) with intrauterine fluid. P. aeruginosa was only cultured from seven donkeys (7/14, 50%) with vulvar discharge. SEZ was isolated from two (2/14, 14.3%) donkeys with purulent vulvar discharge and one donkey (1/16, 6.3%) with fluid in intrauterine. @di$ K. pneumonia @/di$ was cultured from two donkeys (2/16, 12.5%) with intrauterine fluid, while Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated from one donkey with discharge (1/14, 7.1%) and one donkey with fluid (1/16, 6.3%), respectively.	0
@gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ (@gm$ AB @/gm$), a gram-negative bacterium, is commonly present in the environment and can colonize the human intestinal tract and cause extensive infections, such as @di$ pneumonia @/di$, because of the patient's immunosuppressed condition. Lately, multidrug-resistant AB (MDRAB) has become an emerging problem in several hospitals and health settings because of its tendency to accumulate in hospital machinery, in which it can become resistance to antibiotics and difficulty in its eradication. Here, we report an unusual case of MDRAB-induced @di$ pneumonia @/di$ in a patient with RA receiving a TNFI.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ is usually found in the environment and animals, it can occasionally colonize human skin and cause clinical infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or @di$ peritonitis @/di$ associated with peritoneal dialysis.	1
@gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ caused severe disease in a group of Xenopus laevis within 3 weeks of receipt. The primary clinical signs were marked pallor of the skin, petechiation, lethargy, @di$ anorexia @/di$, and edema. The duration of the outbreak was approximately 45 days during which time 21 frogs became sick and 18 died, despite tetracycline therapy. Pale skin, subcutaneous edema and hemorrhages, ascites, and pale livers were seen at necropsy. @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ was isolated from skin, and the same organism was isolated in pure culture from skeletal muscle. Tetracycline treatment via stomach tube was effective if given early in the course of the disease. The outbreak was controlled by removing sick frogs, feeding twice per week, changing the water several hours after feeding, and maintaining the frogs where the ambient temperature was 22 degrees C or lower. The pallor of the skin and general malaise were produced experimentally by crowding normal frogs, changing the water infrequently, and increasing ambient temperatures. Mild disease was reproduced experimentally by subcutaneous injection of @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ into apparently healthy frogs.	1
@gm$ B. producta @/gm$ was described in 1941 and is commonly found in human feces. It has the capacity for rapid growth at the expense of carbon monoxide (CO) through anaerobic digestion. B. ovatus was first reported in 1933 and provides an inherent biosafety feature in the human gut. However, @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ is Gram-positive and B. ovatus is Gram-negative. According to previous studies, human ocular microbiota was characterized to be commonly identified in Gram-positive bacteria, while Acanthamoeba apparently prefer Gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies had demonstrated that amoebae prefer certain species of bacteria as a food source, such as P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens, but not S. epidermidis. It was presumed that the gram-positive cell wall was thick and hard to be digestion for Acanthamoeba. Therefore, the early-stage @di$ keratitis @/di$ isolates harbored abundant Gram-negative bacteria, with B. ovatus suspected as the early food source during initial infection. Notably, the relative abundance of B. ovatus was significantly higher in patients with atopic dermatitis as an immune disorder, whereas @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ had demonstrated prevention of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization.	0
@gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ is a major causative agent of two distinct forms of gastroenteritis diseases linked to food poisoning:emesis and diarrhea:as well as extra-intestinal infections, including @di$ endocarditis @/di$, endophthalmitis, and septicemia.	1
@gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ is capable of producing emesis toxin (ETE) and three enterotoxins, including hemolytic enterotoxin (HBL), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (NHE), and enterotoxin K (EntK), of which HBL and NHE are important enterotoxins that cause @di$ diarrhea @/di$-based food poisoning. There are five virulence genes associated with the production of these enterotoxins: hemolysin BL gene (hbl), non-hemolytic enterotoxin gene (nhe), enterotoxin FM gene (entFM), enterotoxin T gene (becT), and cytotoxin K gene (cytK). HBL requires all three genes positive for hblA, hblC, and hblD to be toxic, while NHE is most toxic when all three genes are positive for nheA, nheB, and nheC. The virulence gene expressing vomitoxin is ces gene, which encodes a heat-resistant toxin that is not easily cleaved. A total of 24 virulence gene carriage patterns of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ were identified, among which the nhe gene had the highest carriage rate of 92.98%, followed by the entFM gene (71.93%), and 70.18% of strains carried both nhe and entFM genes.	1
@gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ was added to the sterile pellet to study the effect of an anaerobic monoclonal abscess (16 rats) or of a biclonal abscess containing both aerobes and anaerobes (32 rats). After inoculation, a peritonitis stage with leucopenia, hypoglycemia, body @di$ weight loss @/di$, and slight fever was followed by the abscess stage with leucocytosis and a slight hyperglycemia. Mild hepatic energy charge deficiency and hepatic lactic acidosis were observed in sterile abscess rats, and slightly enhanced energy charge was seen in monoclonal E. coli abscess rats. The addition of @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ to the sterile pellet, alone or together with E.	1
@gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ showed a greater abundance in PCOS-IR when compared to control-IR. It was found to be specialized in the degradation of xylans with low complexity. Christensenellaceae spp. were shown to have increased relative abundance in the control group. The relative abundance of the Christensenellaceae family has a negative relationship with BMI, LDL, and apolipoprotein B as well as features of metabolic syndrome such as @di$ obesity @/di$ and hypertriglyceridemia, and was positively associated with HDL.	1
@gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ is a genus in the family of Porphyromonadaceae, and is associated with hyperglycemia, @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation in rodents (Le). @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ is also one of the most abundant genera in human feces and can be used to treat vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus faecalis colonization. In addition, it has been reported that @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ from @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ is an intestinal symbiotic bacteria, which can change the tumor microenvironment, reduce regulatory T cells, stimulate the anti-cancer immunomodulator cyclophosphamide (CTL) reaction, and further promote the antitumor efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CTX). In the present study, the relative abundances of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ in HC and LC groups were significantly lower than in the MC group, indicating @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ as one of the most abundant genera in broilers, with its abundance influenced by both heat and cold stresses.	1
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ is frequently isolated from the human intestine, but @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$ is known to be present in the human oral cavity, as well as in the intestine. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ is frequently isolated from active carious lesions and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of dental caries. Possession of an enzyme activity that degrades artificial trypsin substrates, such as benzoylarginine-beta-naphthylamide, has been proposed as a possible virulence factor in the suspected @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$, which is one of the periodontal bacterial isolates, also has this activity. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ belongs to the Bifidobacterium adolescentis group.	1
@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. can be detected in various ecological environments, such as intestines of different vertebrates and invertebrates, dairy products, @di$ dental caries @/di$ and sewage. Considering the increasing application of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. as protective and probiotic cultures , and the fast enlargement of the genus, easy identification tools to discriminate new isolates are essential. Moreover, their correct taxonomic identification is of outmost importance for their use as probiotics . Conventional identification and classification of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species have been based on phenotypic and biochemical features, such as cell morphology, carbohydrate fermentation profiles, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of soluble cellular proteins . In the last years several molecular techniques have been proposed in order to identify bifidobacteria. Most available bifidobacterial identification tools are based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, such as ARDRA , DGGE  and PCR with the use of species-specific primers . However, 16S rDNA of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp.	0
@gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, a recently described anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, was isolated from blood cultures of two patients with @di$ liver abscesses @/di$. These isolates exhibited the expected phenotypic characteristics, and identification was confirmed by cell wall fatty acid analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. This is the first documentation of bacteremia due to @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Brachyspira @/gm$ (@gm$ B.) pilosicoli @/gm$ and B. aalborgi are candidate causal agents of large intestinal spirochetosis. These spirochetes are also related to @di$ adenocarcinoma @/di$, polyps, diarrhea containing blood and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the pathogenesis mechanisms of these agents are not yet fully understood. We are interested in the relationship between the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and intestinal brachyspiral infection. Recently, the presence of brachyspiras was confirmed by histological investigation of patients with intestinal spirochetosis syndrome i.e. @di$ adenocarcinoma @/di$, UC, polyps, diarrhea with blood and septicemia. In addition, the presence of two different genes of the brachyspiral species has been reported on a patient with large intestinal spirochetosis. We therefore attempted and succeeded in simultaneous isolation of both species, @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ and B.	1
@gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ is an anaerobic spirochaete that colonizes the large intestine of humans and various species of animals and birds. The spirochaete is an important enteric pathogen of pigs and poultry, but its pathogenic potential in humans is less clear. In the current study, the occurrence of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ in faecal samples from 766 individuals in two different population groups in Perth, Western Australia, was investigated by selective anaerobic culture. Of 586 individuals who were long-term residents of Perth, including children, elderly patients in care and in hospital and individuals with @di$ gastrointestinal disease @/di$, only one was culture positive. This person had a history of diverticulitis. In comparison, faeces from 17 of 180 (9.4 %) Indonesians who were short- or medium-term visitors to Perth were positive for @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$. The culture-positive individuals had been in the city for between 10 days and 4.5 years (median 5 months). Resampling of subsets of the Indonesians indicated that all negative people remained negative and that some positive individuals remained positive after 5 months. Two individuals had pairs of isolates recovered after 4 and 5 months that had the same PFGE types, whilst another individual had isolates with two different PFGE types that were identified 2 months apart. Individuals who were culture-positive were likely to have been either colonized in Indonesia before arriving in Perth or infected in Perth following contact with other culture-positive Indonesians with whom they socialized. Colonization with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ was not significantly associated with clinical signs at the time the individuals were tested, although faeces with wet-clay consistency were 1.5 times more likely (confidence interval 0.55-4.6) than normal faeces to contain @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$.	0
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ infection is characterized by non-specific symptoms including general body malaise, @di$ anorexia @/di$, fever, back pain, headache, lethargy and many other clinical presentations that often mimic other diseases causing pyrexia such as malaria and typhoid fever. Its ability to survive and multiply within immune cells such as macrophages results into chronic debilitating disease with poor prognosis in most of the cases. In addition, the treatment requires multiple antibiotics for prolonged duration. Despite being important, zoonotic disease data regarding the epidemiology of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ infection among high-risk groups are scarce in developing countries including Tanzania.	1
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ is an intracellular parasitic bacterium causing zoonosis, which is distributed worldwide and mainly characterized by @di$ reproductive disorders @/di$. Erythritol is found in allantoic fluid, chorion, and placenta of aborted animals, preferentially utilized by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ to cause infertility and abortion. However, the erythritol metabolism-defected mutant was unable to function as a vaccine strain due to its residual virulence. Here, we found that erythronate, an oxidative product of erythritol in the host, was also preferentially utilized by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ relying on the function of a deoxyribonucleoside regulator-family transcriptional regulator VdtR. Erythronate utilization activates VdtR regulation of the erythronate metabolic pathway to promote @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ extracellular proliferation, inducing placentitis/abortion in mice. Double mutations on Brucella erythritol and D-erythronate metabolisms significantly reduced bacterial virulence. This study revealed a novel mechanism of Brucella infection-induced abortion, thus providing a new clue for the study of safer @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ attenuated vaccines.	1
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species can cause systemic disease in humans, especially damages to the reproductive system and joints of the individuals. However, the incidence of neurological involvement is rare, with about 2 to 5% of patients involved with the nervous system. Neurobrucellosis (NB) is the most serious complication of brucellosis, which can involve the CNS and the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical presentations of the patients include meningitis, @di$ encephalitis @/di$, meningoencephalitis, radiculitis, myelitis, optic neuritis, and behavioral abnormalities, among which meningitis is the most common presentation accounting for 17 to 74% of NB.	1
@gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$ is the causative agent of brucellosis, which causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant @di$ fever @/di$ in humans. This bacterium infects and proliferates mainly in macrophages and dendritic cells, where it is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Nod-like receptors (NLRs). Our group recently demonstrated the role of AIM2 and NLRP3 in Brucella recognition. Here, we investigated the participation of NLRP12 in innate immune response to @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$. We show that NLRP12 inhibits the early production of IL-12 by bone marrow-derived macrophages upon B. abortus infection. We also observed that NLRP12 suppresses in vitro NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling in response to Brucella. Moreover, we show that NLRP12 modulates caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion in @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infected-macrophages. Furthermore, we show that mice lacking NLRP12 are more resistant in the early stages of B. abortus infection: NLRP12-/- infected-mice have reduced bacterial burdens in the spleens and increased production of IFN-gamma and IL-1beta compared with wild-type controls. In addition, NLRP12 deficiency leads to reduction in granuloma number and size in mouse livers. Altogether, our findings suggest that NLRP12 plays an important role in negatively regulating the early inflammatory responses against @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$, the etiology of bovine brucellosis, is a highly infectious pathogenic bacterial organism that causes infertility, abortion and reproductive failure in cattle (Carvalho-Neta et al., 2010). Brucellosis spreads through contact with aborted foetuses, vaginal fluids, placentae, placental fluids and milk, as well as through congenital and venereal means (Franco et al., 2007). It is one of the major @di$ zoonotic diseases @/di$ of livestock with worldwide occurrence (Pappas et al., 2006) that usually results in huge economic losses due to reproductive problems that include abortion, early calf death, infertility, low milk yield, orchitis, epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis and other problems.	1
@gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$ is a gram-negative coccobacillary bacterium that primarily causes reproductive failure in dogs. The genus @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ comprises 12 recognized species. Of these, B. melitensis, B. abortus, and B. suis are well-known causes of undulant fever and @di$ influenza-like symptoms @/di$ in humans, but B.	1
@gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$ was isolated from the cement or bone surrounding a hip prosthesis after total hip replacement was performed for treatment of hip dysplasia in 2 dogs. Lameness or signs of infection were not evident for 9 and 16 months after surgery. @di$ Osteomyelitis @/di$ surrounding the prostheses was detected radiographically only after the lameness developed.	1
@gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$ is a rough, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile and facultative intracellular bacterium. In rams, the microorganism causes mainly epididymitis, whereas in ewes the lesions are characterized by degeneration and @di$ inflammation @/di$ of the endometrium with focal or diffuse lymphoid infiltrations.	1
@gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$ is a stably rough Gram-negative coccobacillus, not encapsulated, not sporulated, that belongs to the alpha-2-Proteobacteria family. Ovine brucellosis caused by @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ has worldwide distribution in all areas where sheep-raising has economic importance. Infection with @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ is characterized by unilateral @di$ epididymitis @/di$ in males (or bilateral, although less common), testicular degeneration and/or atrophy, that may result in subfertility, causing large economic losses. In ewes, B. ovis infection can lead to abortion or birth of weak offspring, leading to perinatal death. Importantly, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ is not been associated with human infections.	1
@gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ (@gm$ B. suis @/gm$) is the causative agent of porcine brucellosis. Based on preferential infection of different animal hosts, it encompasses five biovars (bv1-5). Biovars 1, 2, and 3 infect domestic pigs, wild boars, and hares, bv 4 is restricted to reindeer and caribou, and bv 5 infects rodents only. Biovar 1 is widely spread in Central and South American pigs, causing several brucellosis outbreaks in pigs, and is linked to zoonotic human infections. Biovars 1 and 3 cause sporadic epidemics in Asia, especially in China. Biovar 4 is endemic to Alaska, Canada, and Northern Russia. It was reported as a rare cause of human disease. On the contrary, biovar 2 is restricted to Europe, where both wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa) and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) are the only recognized wildlife reservoirs of this biovar. Recently, an emerging increase of biovar 2 brucellosis outbreaks in pigs was reported in Europe. These outbreaks mainly were linked to contact of domestic pigs with wildlife reservoirs, import of carrier pigs, or use of infected boar semen. Additionally, spillover infections spread to cattle were reported in several European countries. @gm$ B. suis bv @/gm$ 2 causes bacteremia, abortion, stillbirths, decreased litter size, weak piglets, infertility, and sometimes chronic focal localization as abscess formation in various organs, metritis in females, @di$ orchitis @/di$ in males, and swollen joints with lameness. @gm$ B. suis bv @/gm$ 2 outbreaks have been associated with a high economic impact on the pig industry in Europe.	1
@gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ administration has been shown to alleviate allergic responses, again possibly by the modulation of Tregs (Figure 3). In a mouse model of asthma, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ CGMCC0313.1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and @di$ lung inflammation @/di$ by suppressing the Th2 response and increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10. In asthmatic lungs, mast cells infiltrate the airway and degranulate, releasing inflammatory molecules and proteases that result in tissue swelling. In lungs from mice administered @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$, the number of infiltrating immune cells, level of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), markers of mast cell degranulation, and levels of IgE were all decreased. Similarly, in a food allergy mouse model, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ CGMCC0313.1 treatment resulted in attenuation of allergic reaction, along with an increased measure of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), an indication of increased Treg. Pre - or post-treatment with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ reduced the severity of diarrhea and anaphylaxis, as well as circulating mast cell proteases, IgE, and Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Increased abundance of Tregs in the intestine (mesenteric lymph node) and the associated cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta in the serum were noted. Thus, @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ attenuates the Th2 response-driven allergic reaction and the associated inflammation by mediating the Th2/Treg balance.	2
@gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ @gm$ ATCC 33237 @/gm$ is the type strain of this species and was sequenced to completion. One strain, CCUG 19995, was isolated in 1987 in Sweden from a patient with pyrexia and exanthema. The remaining seven strains (Lasto28.99, Lasto61.99, Lasto64.99, Lasto127.99, Lasto205.94, Lasto220.96, and Lasto393.96) were isolated in South Africa between 1994 and 1999 from patients with dysentery, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, or loose mucoid stools.	1
@gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates obtained from the majority of the patients with IBD (6/8) formed one cluster (Cluster 1). The @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strain (P1CDB1(UNSWCD)) isolated from intestinal biopsies of patient No. 1 with CD, C. concisus strain 13826 (a strain isolated from fecal sample of a patient with @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$) and the oral @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolate obtained from healthy individual No. 3 were also grouped into Cluster 1. All enteric invasive @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ (EICC) strains (see results in Table 2) were grouped into Cluster 1 (Figure 1). Seven of the eight individuals (7/8, 87.5%) whose isolates belonged to Cluster 1 had inflammatory enteric diseases (six patients with IBD and one had @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$), which was significantly higher than the remaining individuals (2/7, 28.6%) (P<0.05). Among the @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates that did not belong to Cluster 1, six isolates were genetically closely related, forming a second cluster (Cluster 2). The oral @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolate obtained from a healthy control (H6O1) was genetically distinct from the other @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ isolates (Figure 1).	1
@gm$ C. eutactus @/gm$ is an obligate anaerobe that and is a constituent of healthy guts but is present at the lowest abundance in the irritable bowel syndrome D subtype. @gm$ C. eutactus @/gm$ leads to the production of butyrate, while Coprococcus species are generally associated with a better quality of life and are depleted in depression. Another obligate anaerobe, D. longicatena, is negatively correlated with markers of dyslipidaemia or @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, indicating its beneficial probiotic effect.	2
@gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ typically enters the blood stream from the gastrointestinal tract in susceptible hosts. Bacteremia is often preceded or accompanied by @di$ diarrhea @/di$, as seen in our case.	1
@gm$ CB @/gm$ can also be used as an adjunct to current therapies. The research of Tian et al. has shown that @gm$ CB @/gm$ reduces adverse events, especially @di$ diarrhea @/di$, caused by chemotherapy for lung cancer. Furthermore, @gm$ CB @/gm$ exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with lapatinib treatment for colon tumors in mice. In ICB therapy, @gm$ CB @/gm$ therapy can enhance the efficacy even in antibiotic-treated patients and is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival.	2
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ can also cause @di$ invasive diseases @/di$, including bacteraemia. We found two cases of bacteraemia due to @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ colonizes the human oral cavity, and some strains can be transferred to the intestine, which play an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), @di$ Barrett's oesophagus @/di$, and gastroenteritis.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ are one of the most common bacteria in bacterial gastroenteritis and @di$ acute enterocolitis @/di$ in humans. However, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host response to C. coli infections. To investigate the influence of genetic changes, we first used PCR to demonstrate the presence of the known virulence genes cadF, virB11, cdtB, cdtC and ceuE in the clinical isolate C. coli 26536, which was isolated from the liver of infected BALB/c mice. Sequence analyses of the cadF, virB11, cdtB and ceuE genes in C. coli 26536 confirmed the stability in these virulence genes during their transmission through the host. We further investigated C. coli infection for the bacterial clearance from the liver and spleen of infected mice, and for their immune response. @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ persisted well in both organs, with better survival in the liver.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ BAA-1457 was also found to upregulate a range of pathways and processes associated with EMT, as well as IGF family signaling in colorectal cancer. Further, the strain isolated from a healthy individual (ATCC 51561) did not appear to upregulate EMT. Notably, studies have found that Campylobacter species are among a polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative bacteria (including Fusobacterium) that are enriched in colorectal cancer patient samples, suggesting that the presence of some types of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains in the gut may have the potential to promote functions associated with carcinogenesis. Moreover, a similar polymicrobial signature comprising Campylobacter and Fusobacterium species is enriched in patients in the early stages of the oesophageal adenocarcinoma cascade (@di$ gastro-oesophageal reflux disease @/di$ and Barrett's oesophagus). Thus, it would be interesting to determine if some @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains can regulate EMT in oesophageal epithelial cells.	1
@gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ and C. coli are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tracts of animals and are regarded as the most frequent causes of acute bacterial enteritis in humans. The main pathways by which humans acquire infection are the consumption of undercooked poultry meat, food cross-contaminated with raw poultry product, water contaminated with @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ from animals or humans, and direct contact with animals or human clinical campylobacteriosis cases. Campylobacteriosis in humans is usually a self-limiting condition involving @di$ diarrhea @/di$, abdominal cramping, and fever of up to 2 weeks' duration. However, neonates, the elderly, and individuals with immune disorders might develop more serious symptoms that necessitate antimicrobial therapy. In such cases, macrolides such as erythromycin are the first choice for treatment, although in many countries the use of ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) is used preferred on an empirical basis. The emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp., combined with the high incidence of Campylobacter infections in humans, is a major concern for public health.	1
@gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ species are spore-forming gram-positive anaerobic bacilli ubiquitous soil organisms often found in the digestive tract of humans . C. perfringens produces an alpha toxin, which is associated with cytoskeletal disruption and resulting vascular leak. The early signs of @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ toxic shock syndrome are nonspecific; they include lethargy, pallor, nausea, vomiting, and pain at the site of infection. The syndrome is notable for the absence of fever. After 48-72 hours of infection, the patients develop refractory hypotension, severe @di$ tachycardia @/di$, extensive peripheral edema, effusions, hemoconcentration, and leukemoid reaction.	1
@gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ (@gm$ CB @/gm$), an endospore-producing probiotic, is a promising product with the stronger resistance to stress (e.g. acid, alkali, high temperature and antibiotics) and the better adaptability to the gastrointestinal environment than other probiotics. The previous reports have indicated that @gm$ CB @/gm$ functions for the regulating energy metabolism, the promoting digestion and absorption, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and also anti-cancer in humans and animals. This microbe can also regulate the intestinal microecological balance in host by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant strains and increasing the colonization of butyrate-producing beneficial bacteria. Butyrate, a main product of @gm$ CB @/gm$ bacteria, plays a key role in repairing intestinal mucosal damage and maintaining the intestinal microecological balance. For example, the @gm$ CB @/gm$ MIYAIRI 588 strain can increase the number of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, protect the mucin layer of the intestinal epithelium by producing lactic acid and butyric acid, and therefore effectively reversing clindamycin-induced @di$ intestinal dysbiosis @/di$. In Japan, the @gm$ CB @/gm$ has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections. Recently, we have obtained a new @gm$ CB strain @/gm$ that derived from the healthy adult pigs. The bacterium is named @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ XKYQRL 2021 (CBX 2021) and it produces spores and has good growth characteristics and stable metabolic function.	2
@gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$:a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus:can consume undigested dietary fibers and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically butyrate and acetate. The administration of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$, both in clinical practice and animal models, have had a beneficial effect on inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal tumor development, as well as cerebral ischemia, and obesity, without serious side effects in Asia  . The protection of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ on liver diseases has also been demonstrated well in animal models, such as the role of modulating TLR signaling pathways in high-fat, diet-induced @di$ liver injury @/di$  , and in relieving the CCl4-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the @di$ liver @/di$ by regulating NF-kappaB, IL-10 and the gut microbiota in mice. It was firmly established that intravenous administration of butyrate protects LPS-induced @di$ liver injury @/di$ by inhibiting the inflammation  . Partially building on this knowledge and inspired by research on the role of @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ dietary supplementation in the disease pathophysiology of the @di$ liver @/di$ and other organs, this study investigated the possibility that @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ dietary supplementation attenuates HIRI in rats.	2
"@gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ is a common soil and enteric bacterium that is infrequently recovered from the vagina. We describe three women in which @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ caused puerperal infection and a distinctive and lethal toxic shock-like syndrome. Patients were less than 1 week post partum and each had a single, limited focus of infection including infection associated with a retained vaginal sponge, a cesarean section operative site, and endometritis. Each patient had a distinctive course characterized by sudden onset of clinical @di$ shock @/di$ marked by severe and unrelenting hypotension associated with marked, generalized tissue edema and ""third spacing"" with increased hematocrit, presence of marked leukemoid reaction with total neutrophil counts of 84,000/mm3, 66,000/mm3, and 93,600/mm3, absence of rash or fever, limited or no myonecrosis, and a rapid and uniformly lethal course. Hypoalbuminemia was also noted. Similar findings were noted in prior isolated reports of @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$-mediated postpartum or surgical infection. Treatment of animals with @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ or closely related C. difficile toxins produces similar findings. We suggest that localized infection with toxin-producing strains of @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$ can produce a rapidly lethal toxic shock-like syndrome."	1
@gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ is a rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, peritrichous, facultative anaerobic Gram-negative foodborne pathogen, belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family (Stephan et al.,). @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ is occasionally detected in meat, vegetables, cereals and dairy (Beuchat et al.,). In particular, powdered infant formula has been linked with many C. sakazakii infections, according to an epidemiological report (Yan et al.,). @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ contamination more frequently causes infection in infants or adults with lowered immunity, suffering from @di$ bacteremia @/di$, meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis or other diseases, and a lethality rate of more than 50% has been reported (Ye et al.,).	1
@gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ is an emerging foodborne pathogen, causing life-threatening forms of neonatal meningitis, sepsis, and NEC in newborn and premature infants, with a fatality rate of 40% to 80%. In addition to its high-fatality rate, it may also result in severe neurological sequelae such as quadriplegia, @di$ hydrocephalus @/di$ and retarded neural development in survivors. The environmental source of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ is not evidently understood; however, the epidemiological studies implicate reconstituted powdered infant formula (PIF) as the possible source of transmission. Survival of bacteria in such a dry environment largely depends on the osmotic and/or dry stress resistance of the bacteria. Our laboratory has previously reported the prevalence of @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ among different food and environmental commodities. The isolates expressed different virulent factors such as hemolytic and chitinase activity along with the presence of genes encoding for hemolysin, outer membrane protein (ompA), @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ plasminogen activator (cpa) and ferric ion transporter protein (eitA).	1
@gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ is an opportunistic pathogen known to cause acute @di$ meningitis @/di$ and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. It has been isolated from a wide range of food and environmental samples, and has been linked to outbreaks associated with powdered infant formula. This study was carried out to assess variations in growth conditions (temperature, pH, and sugar supplement) and to establish how these changes impact phenotypic characteristics for successful recovery and identification of @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$, particularly for routine surveillance purposes. A total of six @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ isolates were tested to evaluate the above growth conditions, including three ATCC @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ reference and three environmental isolates obtained from regulatory sample screening. Although only slight changes in colony-forming units were observed across the pH range and the sugars tested, the morphology was significantly impacted by changes in these growth factors. Incubation between 30 and 50  C resulted in growth after 24 h, and the growth was slower at ambient temperature and colony formation was most robust at 30  C. Results of this study suggest that 30  C may be suitable for recovery of some @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ strains, and minor variations in growth conditions can alter colony morphology and appearance. Expression of unique biological characteristics based on phenotypic observations may be beneficial for differentiating various @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ strains.	1
@gm$ E. coli @/gm$ displays a peculiar genome plasticity that enables the flow of genes in and out of the cell, generating high variability of the gene content among lineages that include resistance and virulence genes. Within this species, extraintestinal pathogenic @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ (ExPEC) is a versatile pathotype that typically causes urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, sepsis, pneumonia, and @di$ meningitis @/di$.	1
@gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ is an organism seldom reported to cause human infections. Here, we report a case of a biliary tract infection in a female patient with cholangiocarcinoma caused by @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$. CASE: A 56-year-old female presented with fever and abdominal pain. Bile aspirated during the ERCP was received in our laboratory. The gram stain of the bile sample revealed abundant polymorphonuclear leucocytes along with gram-positive diplococci. The organism failed to grow on MacConkey agar. On blood agar, non-hemolytic colonies grew. The organism was identified as @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ by MALDI-TOF MS. The antibiotic susceptibility performed using VITEK2 revealed it to be resistant to high-level gentamicin and susceptible to all remaining drugs. She was successfully treated with oral ciprofloxacin for the infection. DISCUSSION: Bile is colonized with bacteria due to obstruction in the biliary tree, leading to @di$ cholangitis @/di$. This causes bacterial proliferation and translocation of bacteria into the systemic circulation. Our case was resistant to high-level gentamicin, while all previously reported cases were susceptible. The resistant isolates of @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ being isolated from cattle and their surroundings amidst the rampant use of antibiotics in livestock can pose a difficult situation for humans. Thus, there should be regulations on antibiotic usage in livestock. Cases like these should be reported and recognized for their potential to cause outbreaks if they remain unreported. CONCLUSION: Thus, @gm$ E.hirae @/gm$, when encountered, should not be ignored but considered a pathogen and reported.	1
@gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ is an anaerobic, non-spore-forming gram-positive bacillus that is among the natural members of the gut microbiota. Previous studies have shown that Th17 activation may have effects on related inflammatory diseases, familial Mediterranean fever, some infections, and @di$ autoimmune diseases @/di$. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis were found to be higher in the Behcet's disease group than in the Eggerthella control group at the genus level. In our study, a significant increase was observed in the MIS-C group at both the genus (@gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$) and species levels (@gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$). Considering autoimmunity and the Th17 pathway in the pathogenesis of MIS-C, our findings suggest that an increase in @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ may be associated with the pathogenesis.	1
@gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ was first described by Arnold Eggerth in 1935, which was originally named @gm$ Eubacterium lentum @/gm$. @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ is a normal bacterium that can colonize the human gut, female reproductive tract, oral cavity, and prostate gland. Due to the nature of strictly anaerobic and slow growth, @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ is difficult to culture and identify. Although, until recently, several microbial identification techniques, particularly mass spectrometry, were used to identify bacteria, an increasing number of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ infections in humans have been reported, referring to bloodstream infection, liver abscess, bacterial vaginosis and @di$ meningitis @/di$. However, a unified standard treatment and its pathogenic mechanism have not yet been recognized. Here, we report cases of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ bacteremia cured by ceftizoxime and review the existing recent literature. This article aims to add to existing data for the timely diagnosis and treatment of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ bacteremia.	1
@gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ is a genus of facultative Gram-negative anaerobes that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. These opportunistic pathogens commonly target immunocompromised hosts, who are implanted with IMD or on mechanical ventilation. The genus has been implicated in a wide spectrum of nosocomial infections, namely urinary and respiratory tract infections. Subsequently, patients with a prolonged hospital stay, especially those in ICU are at increased risk of contracting associated infections. Given the ubiquitous nature of @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$, infections can be acquired from both endogenous and exogenous source. However, most nosocomial infections are contracted endogenously from previously colonised patients who have received prior antibiotic therapy. Among the different species of @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$, @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$ and E. cloacae are the two most frequently encountered pathogens in patients; although the former species has been speculated to belong to the Klebsiella genus. E. cloacae, especially, currently accounts for 4%-5% of all nosocomial bacteraemia, pneumoniae and @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$. Due to the species diversity of the genus itself, antimicrobial susceptibility varies widely within @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$, however, both E. cloacae and @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$ are almost uniformly resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin and other beta-lactam drugs, among others. Both species have demonstrated the intrinsic ability to form biofilm, however, due to their relative prevalence among the @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ genus, biofilm production has predominantly been studied in E.	1
@gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ is a gram negative bacillus that is ubiquitous as a contaminant and a pathogen in adult, paediatric, and neonatal ICUs. Its transmission is almost exclusively nosocomial with community acquired infection reported rarely. We report a case of community acquired, rapidly progressive @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ @di$ meningo-encephalitis @/di$ in a neonate. A three-week-old term infant presented from home, having been discharged from hospital within two days of delivery. She rapidly progressed to multi-organ dysfunction. Initial CT of her brain showed evidence of severe hypoxic changes and herniation of the frontal lobes through the anterior fontanelle. Care was withdrawn 72 hours after admission. Post mortem examination confirmed @gm$ E.cloacae @/gm$ @di$ meningo-encephalitis @/di$ as a cause of her death. The baby had not been in a critical care environment at any time before admission, making it highly likely to have been a community acquired infection. Transmission of the organism may have been vertical as maternal transmission with intestinal colonization of neonates with @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ has previously been reported. This case confirms that infection with @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ should be included in the differential diagnosis of any severely ill neonate presenting from the community, and antimicrobial therapy should be optimized accordingly.	1
@gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ causes @di$ erysipelas @/di$ in swine and is considered a reemerging disease contributing substantially to economic losses in the swine industry. Since an attenuated live vaccine was commercialized in 1974 in Japan, outbreaks of acute septicemia or subacute urticaria of @di$ erysipelas @/di$ have decreased dramatically. In contrast, a chronic form of @di$ erysipelas @/di$ found during meat inspections in slaughterhouses has been increasing.	1
@gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ septicemia, associated with an increased mortality of captive psittacines in a mixed-species aviary, was diagnosed by histopathology, Gram staining, bacterial culture and sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Over a period of 23 days with no premonitory signs, 2 rainbow lorikeets and an eclectus parrot died. Of these birds, one lorikeet and the eclectus were submitted for necropsy. The main pathologic findings were thrombosis (2/2), bacterial embolism/thromboembolism (2/2), necrotizing hepatitis (2/2), necrohemorrhagic myocarditis (1/2), fibrinohemorrhagic and heterophilic visceral coelomitis (1/2), submandibular necrosuppurative dermatitis with necrotizing @di$ vasculitis @/di$ and bacterial and fungal thromboembolism (1/2), and locally extensive rhabdomyonecrosis with bacterial embolism (1/2). Intralesional bacteria were positive by Gram staining and immunohistochemistry in both cases. @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ was isolated by routine bacterial culture from the liver of the lorikeet, which was also positive by real-time PCR.	1
@gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$, Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus australis, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium oral taxon 096 were positive in DCHD vs. CHD, DCHD vs. @di$ DM @/di$, and CHD vs. NM but negative in @di$ DM @/di$ vs. NM (Fig. 2C). These species can serve as a distinctive microbial consortium associated with DCHD, and the presence of diabetes can further affect these microbiota (Fig. 2E). The abundance of @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ increased in the oral cavity of patients with DCHD, while the abundance of R.	1
@gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$, an anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium, located in the intermediate layers of mature subgingival biofilms, is associated with periodontitis and colorectal cancer. Histological studies have revealed that macrophages induced by @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ aggravate the progression of @di$ colitis @/di$ and are also related with complications of pregnancy, the synthesis of LPS being important to be considered among its pathogenicity factors. Furthermore, it has been observed that @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ shows a synergy with the presence of P. gingivalis favoring the loss of alveolar bone. Both microorganisms increased the gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4. However, when analyzing the relationship between periodontitis and arthritis in mice, in which a mixture of P. gingivalis, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomintans was inoculated, less loss of alveolar bone was observed than when mice were inoculated with P. gingivalis alone, and oral inoculation with @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ or A.	1
@gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ and Atopobium vaginae are especially known to be associated with BV. Although BV is a benign pathology, we report a septic shock caused by @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ and Atopobium vaginae after a total hysterectomy with adnexectomy due to @di$ leiomyosarcoma @/di$.	0
@gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$ is an anaerobic, gram-variable bacterium primarily found in vaginal microflora of women. Previous reports of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ cultured in men are few and have primarily been limited to the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.2-4 Few reports of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ causing severe infections have been reported in the literature, including septicemia7 and two cases of @di$ perinephric abscess.8,9 @/di$ There has been one previously reported case of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ causing pulmonary complications that occurred in a male alcohol abuser. In our case review, we aim to demonstrate an unusual source of a pulmonary infection and highlight the importance of proper microbial isolation to guide treatment. Our patient is a young male who presented following multiple gunshot wounds including one to his head causing an intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and a dural sinus thrombosis. His hospital course was complicated by a decline in neurological status treated with a craniotomy and external drain placement and multiple pulmonary infections. During his fever work-ups, he found to have @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ on mini-bronchoalveolar lavage and was subsequently treated with metronidazole. After treating his G. vaginalis pneumonia and other infectious sources, namely Haemaphilus influenzae and coagulase-negative staphylococcus pneumonias, his fevers and leukocytosis resolved and he was successfully discharged to a rehabilitation facility for neurologic recovery. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ isolated from a pulmonary culture and the first in a previously healthy, immunocompetent young male outside of the urinary tract.	1
@gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$, which belongs to the HACEK (Haemophilus ssp, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) group, is a rare cause of subacute endocarditis and may lead to ischemic stroke. A 65-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with rheumatic valve disease was submitted to surgical mitral valve repair in 1996. Physical examination did not reveal any murmurs; physical examination of the lungs and abdomen was normal. The patient was admitted to hospital with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and fever. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an approximately 8-mm filamentous image with chaotic motion in the ventricular face of the anterior mitral valve leaflet compatible with vegetation. Treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamicin was initiated. @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ grew in five blood culture samples. Along the hospital stay, the patient's level of consciousness decreased, and she was diagnosed with ischemic stroke of cardioembolic etiology. The patient developed @di$ septic shock @/di$ refractory to the prescribed treatment and died 12 days after admission. Even though the patient started being treated for endocarditis before the infectious agent was identified, the prompt use of antimicrobials hindered the growth of @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ and made its isolation difficult.	1
@gm$ L. gasseri @/gm$ also has probiotic characteristics. Based on the results of other studies, it can be inferred that the changes in intestinal microbiota might be because of E. faecium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. E. faecium could significantly reduce the number of Clostridium spp. in feces as a result of oral feeding to 12 healthy house dogs. In another study, @di$ diarrhea @/di$ was significantly reduced in cats living in animal shelters by feeding E.	2
@gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ may be biologically active after heat treatment, although knowledge of the molecular mechanisms is lacking. Joo et al. observed that macrophages treated with LPS in the presence of HI-@gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ significantly decrease the productions of IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha compared with LPS alone. Additionally, another report showed that heat killed @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ paracacei KW3110 induces dectin-2 gene expression in macrophages and activates macrophages to produce IL-10, which may be related to the characteristic carbohydrate chain of L.actobacillus paracacei KW3110. Oral administration of HI-@gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ significantly inhibits the production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increases the production of IL-10 and CD206 in 2,3,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mice by suppressing LPS-induced nuclear factor kappa-B activation. In our study, we found HI-@gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ treatment also significantly decreased the proportions of total macrophages and increased the proportions IL-10+ M2 macrophages in the liver. However, relatively little research has focused on @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ cell membrane. We reason the cell surface architecture of @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ may mediate toll-like receptor 2-dependent extracellular regulated protein kinases activation to alleviate SILI and regulate macrophages response. Further study will address whether the specific structure of @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ cell membrane is potentially therapeutically useful for sepsis and whether the immune response is associated with this effect.	2
@gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ is a catalase-negative gram-positive bacterium that is used in the dairy industry as a starter in cheese fermentation. Because it rarely causes infectious disease in humans, there are only a few reports of @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$-associated infection in immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with native valve endocarditis, osteomyelitis, @di$ spondylitis @/di$, and liver abscess. In addition, to date, only 4 cases of @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$-associated PD peritonitis have been reported: L. cremoris-associated PD peritonitis in Belgium, @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ in Turkey, L. cremoris in Canada, and L. garvieae in Taiwan. In Korea, consumption of dairy products has increased recently reflecting rising incomes and Westernized diets; therefore, there may be an increased risk of @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$-associated infectious disease, especially in immune-deficient patients. In our case, the patient frequently ate and handled butter without washing his hands before dressing his exit site and handling the peritoneal dialysate. Therefore, contamination during exchange was a possible route of infection. Owing to the presence of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in this case, we also considered intra-abdominal disease and transluminal contamination. Although the abdominal computed tomography scan showed no obvious causes of the intra-abdominal lesions except peritonitis, invisible lesions such as micro-perforations are a possible source of transmission, because @gm$ Lactococcus @/gm$, along with other Enterobacteriaceae, are part of the normal gastrointestinal tract flora.	1
"@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ bacteria are widely known for their beneficial health effects and their use as probiotics. Despite several studies reporting a higher abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ to be associated with diverse positive factors like sleep and self-judgment, no direct correlation of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ abundance and affective disorder could be identified. Family Streptococcaceae and genus Streptococcus showed a positive correlation with @di$ depression @/di$ and lower quality of life scores. For example, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus Group A infections are known to potentially cause Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders (Associated with Streptococcal Infections, ""PANDAS""), which are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome and the nervous system. Although not fully understood, it demonstrates that Streptococcus infections can lead to an autoimmune response, severe brain alterations, disturbed neurotransmitters, and can cause psychiatric symptoms like obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, anxiety, and sometimes even @di$ depression @/di$. Of the included studies, four reported an elevation of Streptococcaceae (or OTUs within this family) and Streptococcus in MDD and BD. Additionally, investigating a large cohort, Valles-Colomer et al. found a negative association between Streptococcus and body pain, but no direct association with @di$ depression @/di$, maybe due to the cohort representing the general population and not being limited to specifically MDD or BD subjects."	0
@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ is acidogenic bacteria that cause @di$ dental caries @/di$. Children and adults suffer from pain, structural damage to their teeth, and eventual tooth loss due to the loss of mineralized tissues. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ is the most common bacteria that cause periodontal diseases and cause inflammation, and infection. An arsenal of redox potentials is found in plant extracts. NPs with defined sizes can be produced by biogenic synthesis using phytochemical compounds as stabilizers. Propolis is used in traditional medicine for its biological properties. The antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties of propolis are noteworthy. Propolis exhibits antiproliferative and antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. It depends on the region, climate, and extraction season. Because propolis contains polyphenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, it can produce gold NPs. The cost of manufacturing metallic NPs can be reduced by capping and reducing metallic NPs with biological components. Since they do not require excessive pressure or energy, they are environmentally friendly and energy-efficient. NPs can be manufactured from medicinal plants. Allium sativum, Aleo vera, and Punica granatum have been used to synthesize copper NPs. This research aimed to synthesize the CuO NPs using propolis extracts and evaluate their antibacterial and cytotoxicity on @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ and HEK-293 cells, respectively.	1
@gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ is a homofermentative Gram-positive bacterium used as a starter culture in a wide variety of fermented food products. Its small genome size, the availability of tightly regulated promoter systems, mild proteolytic activity and generally-regarded-as-safe status make it an ideal host for the production, secretion and delivery of peptides directly to the intestine. Recombinant interleukin 10-producing @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ has been shown to protect against @di$ colitis @/di$ in mouse models and is now being tested in a phase 2a clinical trial in patients with Crohn's disease, indicating the potential of recombinant bacterial strains in the treatment of human disease.	2
@gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$ and its other members belong to the family Streptococcaceae, and they are used in different industries for meat preservation, starters, and flavoring purposes. There are many studies on the isolation and antimicrobial features of probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. However, few studies correlate the probiotic effect on neurological inflammation. Therefore, this study aims to focus on the probiotic potential of @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$ and its role in the modulation of neuroinflammation. It has recently been reported that Lactococcus lactis displayed a significant positive impact in an LPS-induced depression-like model in mice, alleviated depressive and @di$ anxiety @/di$ symptoms in mice, attenuated acute psychological stress in healthy Japanese men, and prevented the migration of cells into the spinal cord in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	2
@gm$ Legionella @/gm$ is a well-known cause of @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionnaires' disease include myocarditis, neurological involvement (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), and multiorgan failure. Legionnaires' disease has been reported together with several types of skin lesions such as maculopapular rash, petechial rash, erythema with focal blister, cellulitis, pustules, abscesses, and subcutaneous masses. Various species of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$, including L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. cincinnatiensis, L. maceachernii, and L. feeleii, cause skin/soft tissue infection, mostly among immunocompromised patients with @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Primary cutaneous infection is a rare distinctive feature of direct inoculation of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ into skin and soft tissue, which occurs as cellulitis necrotizing fasciitis, as a postoperative complication. The diagnosis of legionellosis can be challenging in the absence of @di$ pneumonia @/di$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of panniculitis due to @gm$ Legionella @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$ is a Gram-negative bacterium found in natural and man-made water systems where it replicates within amoebas and ciliates. In humans, once inside the lungs, @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ replicates in alveolar macrophages and causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe @di$ pneumonia @/di$. The Icm/Dot type IVb secretion system is a major virulence factor required for intracellular multiplication. The Icm/Dot system allows the secretion of effectors into the cytoplasm of the host cell. These effectors modify host cell vesicular trafficking and prevent maturation of the phagosome. The innate immune response is crucial in restricting @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ proliferation. TNF-alpha is one of the major cytokines involved in this process as it renders macrophages more resistant to L. pneumophila infection and induces apoptosis of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$-infected macrophages. Tail-specific proteases (Tsp) are involved in tolerating thermal stress and in virulence. We have previously characterized the Tsp encoded by @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$, showing that it is important for surviving thermal stress and for infection of amoeba when a temperature change occurs during infection.	1
@gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$ is a motile gram-negative bacterium that is the cause of a severe form of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ called Legionnaires' disease. Virulence of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ depends on its capacity to replicate inside host macrophages. @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ utilizes a type IV secretion system (encoded by the dot/icm genes) to inject effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells. The secreted effector proteins (more than 30 of which have now been identified) direct the host cell to create a unique intracellular vacuole in which @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ can thrive and multiply.	1
@gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$, which causes community-acquired pneumonia that requires hospitalization, is an opportunistic pathogen that is omnipresent in aquatic environments in which it replicates in free-living amoebae. @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ pneumonia is strongly associated with high morbidity. Moreover, legionellosis is consistently reported as one of the top three most identified respiratory pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia, along with the hospital-acquired @di$ pneumonia @/di$.	1
@gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ are Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci, that belong to the family Lactobacillaceae. They are primarily known to be resistant to glycopeptides including vancomycin. The @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ species have been recently identified to cause serious infections, including bacteremia, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, liver and lung abscesses, @di$ peritonitis @/di$, and intra-abdominal infections. Reported cases of infections caused by the @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ species are limited in the literature.	1

@gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ can cause lung disease, local cutaneous disease, @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, joint infections and ocular disease.	1
@gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$, which is capable of utilizing lactic acid in the rumen, is believed to be responsible for rumen health maintenace. In the present study, although @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ administration did not significantly affect rumen score and liver score, it reduced the risk of livestock experiencing @di$ liver abscess @/di$ and the incidence of diarrhoea and bloat. This reduced risk of @di$ liver abscess @/di$ reflects a mutually beneficial rumen fermentation between @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ and rumen microbes. Furthermore, Miller et al stated that livestock given commercial probiotic @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ Lacticpro experienced a decrease in the incidence and severity of @di$ liver abscess @/di$, which indicated that @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ was effective in preventing acidosis in cattle. Meanwhile, the number of cattle that experienced diarrhoea and bloat were lower following the @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ supplementation. Administration of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ strain NCIMB 41125 was able to reduce morbidity or livestock experiencing health problems.	2
@gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ belongs to the group photochromogens, and is a slow-growing acid-fast bacillus, being the second most common NTM infection in the United States after Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). These organisms are generally isolated from treated water sources such as tap water, swimming pools and fish tanks, but have also been isolated from natural water sources as well. Cases in the US have most commonly been encountered in the southern and central regions of the country. The infection is acquired through the aerosol route, whereas most other NTM have also been reported to be acquired through inoculation or ingestion as well. Infections by @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ have been associated with heavy smoking and alcohol abuse. Other risk factors include @di$ COPD @/di$, previous gastrectomy, immunocompromised status, or a history of prior pulmonary TB. In patients with HIV, the incidence of M. kansasii infection rises with a CD4 count of <50/mm3. Clinically, @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ can affect multiple organs and systems, either individually or with disseminated disease. Pulmonary disease is the most common presentation of M. kansasii infection. It is usually seen in the form of chronic pulmonary cavitary lesions typically affecting the upper lobes of the lungs. Symptoms of pulmonary @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ typically resembles that of tuberculosis, often leading to misdiagnosis.	1
@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with @di$ brain and muscular abscesses @/di$.	1
@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, @di$ periodontitis @/di$ and peri-implantitis.	1

@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (@di$ anorexia @/di$, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and @di$ obesity @/di$) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
@gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ is a waterborne @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ that commonly infects fish and amphibians worldwide, but transmission to humans can occasionally occur, typically as a granulomatous skin infection following minor hand trauma. Infection involving the lungs is very rare. We herein describe a case of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$-associated pneumonia and pneumothorax. In August 2008, an 81-year-old man was admitted to a hospital for detailed examination of weight loss and an abnormal shadow on chest imaging. Based on a sputum test, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis caused by @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ was diagnosed. At that time, the blood chemistry revealed no respiratory symptoms or inflammatory findings, and the patient was treated on an outpatient basis with erythromycin and an expectorant. In late November 2008, sputum and coughing were observed. Furthermore, the patient developed a @di$ fever @/di$ and chest pain that increased while breathing and he visited the emergency outpatient unit of our hospital on December 1. Hypoxemia, bilateral pneumonia, and right pneumothorax were observed, and a chest tube was inserted into the right thoracic cavity. Results of an acid-fast bacteria smear from the sputum and pleural effusion were positive, and @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ was identified on culture. The patient was diagnosed as having a lung infection complicated by pneumothorax caused by @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ (MTB) is a pathogen that infects and kills millions yearly. The @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$'s cell wall glycolipid trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) has been used historically to model MTB induced inflammation and granuloma formation. Alterations to the model can significantly influence the induced pathology. One such method incorporates intraperitoneal pre-exposure, after which the intravenous injection of TDM generates pathological damage effectively mimicking the @di$ hypercoagulation @/di$, thrombus formation, and tissue remodeling apparent in lungs of infected individuals. The purpose of these experiments is to examine the histological inflammation involved in the TDM mouse model that induces development of the hemorrhagic response. TDM induced lungs of C57BL/6 mice to undergo granulomatous inflammation. Further histological examination of the peak response demonstrated tissue remodeling consistent with @di$ hypercoagulation @/di$. The observed vascular occlusion indicates that obstruction likely occurs due to subendothelial localized activity leading to restriction of blood vessel lumens. Trichrome staining revealed that associated damage in the @di$ hypercoagulation @/di$ model is consistent with intra endothelial cell accumulation of innate cells, bordered by collagen deposition in the underlying parenchyma. Overall, the @di$ hypercoagulation @/di$ model represents a comparative pathological instrument for understanding mechanisms underlying development of hemorrhage and vascular occlusion seen during MTB infection.	1
@gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ appears to have been the cause of respiratory disease in poultry since at least 1981, although its biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic position were not determined until the early 1990's. It is a global pathogen and has been isolated not only from turkeys and chickens but also a variety of other domesticated and wild birds, including chukar partridges, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, gulls, ostriches, partridges, pheasants, pigeons, quail, rooks, and falcons. A typing scheme based on the reaction of monospecific antisera with heat-extracted antigens has so far discriminated 18 serotypes of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$, designated as A through R, although not all isolates are typeable. The most common clinical signs of disease related to @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ are pneumonia, tracheitis, airsacculitis, @di$ sinusitis @/di$, and pericarditis.	1
@gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$(ORT) causes @di$ respiratory infections @/di$, such as airsacculitis and pneumonia, in birds all over the world.	1
@gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ produces valeric acid, an SCFA. Valeric acid has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms implicated in a variety of disorders such as cancer, colitis, and @di$ cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases @/di$. In this study, @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ showed a positive relationship with fiber consumption (Table 3).	2
@gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ is an anaerobic, commensal bacteria of the human colon that utilizes oxalate as its sole energy source. Controlled diet studies have shown that colonized individuals, estimated between 38-77% of the world's population, excrete significantly less oxalate than non-colonized individuals. Furthermore, lack of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ colonization has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for both @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$ and recurrent calcium oxalate stone disease but has not been studied as a therapy in the bariatric population. Our group has previously reported elevations in fecal fat and urinary oxalate in an obese rodent model of RYGB. We hypothesized that @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ colonization could reverse RYGB-associated @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$ and examined the effect of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ colonization on urinary oxalate excretion and intestinal oxalate transport in this established hyperoxaluric model.	2
@gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ can infect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Most of the reported @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$-related infections occurred in immunocompetent adults with several comorbidities, as shown in Table 4. A few cases were reported in immunocompromised adults. Gani et al. reported bacteremia in a patient with resistant HIV/AIDS. Huang et al. reported meningitis in a patient with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and buccal cancer. Gupta et al. previously reported a wound infection in a patient with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a prolonged history of asthma and intermittent corticosteroid use. Our patient had a 10-year history of prostate cancer with bone metastases and was receiving treatment with abiraterone 1000 mg daily with an injection every three months and prednisone 5 mg daily. His immune system might be compromised due to his prostate cancer and treatment. It can be argued that @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ caused an opportunistic @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$ in our immunocompromised patient.	1
@gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is a fastidious, anaerobic, gram-positive coccus that is found in healthy human oral and gastrointestinal flora. Previous studies have reported that @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is involved in @di$ lung abscesses @/di$, iliopsoas abscesses, gastric carcinogenesis and infections of the periodontal area, soft tissue, bone and joints. Currently, based on metagenomic or 16S RNA sequencing analysis, numerous studies have revealed the relationship between @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ and CRC. By analyzing the 16S rRNA gene sequence data of 509 fecal samples from ethnically different cohorts, including those from China and Austria, Yu et al observed that the detection rate and abundance of @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ were significantly higher in patients with CRC compared with controls, and these results were further validated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 309 subjects. By analyzing the metagenomics sequencing results from 778 (including 386 samples from patients with CRC and 392 controls) and 969 (meta-analysis of five publicly available databases and two new cohorts with validation of the findings of two additional cohorts) stool samples, two research groups discovered that CRC-related microbial markers, including @gm$ P. micra @/gm$, could be consistently detected among different populations, regardless of the detection techniques, diet, geographical environment, genetics and other factors. These results demonstrate that @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ has an important relationship with CRC, and may be involved in the development of CRC.	1
@gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is an anaerobic Gram-positive coccus and its diagnosis is often challenging because it is difficult to culture. Furthermore, its pathogenicity has not been studied extensively. A previous study reported that the strong proteolytic activity of @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ could be important in @di$ abscess @/di$ development. @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ forms hydrogen sulfide, which is cytotoxic, from glutathione, a tripeptide involved in intracellular defense against reactive oxygen metabolites.	1
@gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ converts food into nutrients and promote mineral utilization. To the best of our knowledge, phytic acid is harmful to mineral bioavailability. Moreover, sourdough-derived @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ B3 and B11 and chicken intestine-derived @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ CFR R38 and R35 were able to degrade phytate and promote mineral bioavailability. Similarly, from among 60 strains of LAB from cereal- and pulse-based fermented mixtures, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ CFR R123 not only significantly improved the availability of calcium but also reduced cholesterol and beta-galactosidase levels. @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ CFR R123 degraded 43% of phytate in one hour in an experiment designed by Raghavendra et al.. These phytate-degrading @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ have potential as nutritive food additives. In the model of grass carp sausages, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ GY23 showed a proteolytic profile that was different from that of other LAB. With high proteolysis ability, Malaysian food-derived @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ UP-2 could produce 15 extracellular amino acids (AAs) for body nutrition or biological functions. Isolated from tempeh-fermented soybean cake, @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ TL-3 was confirmed to have the highest threonine and methionine production among LAB. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that has been reported to ameliorate diabetes, @di$ hypertension @/di$, and even cancer development. There are several kinds of LAB that produce GABA, and @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ HN8, which was collected from Thai fermented pork sausage, is one such LAB. Moreover, one strain of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ in Assam produced dextran, which is nonpoisonous and bioactive.	2
@gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$ (@gm$ P. micra @/gm$) is a member of GPAC normally found in the oral cavity, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and the female genitourinary tract. Originally known as @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$, the organism was reclassified as @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ in 2006. @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is one of the bacterial species most frequently isolated from infected root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ has also been implicated in meningitis, @di$ cervical and brain abscess @/di$, infective endocarditis (IE), and spondylodiscitis. Recently, Badri et al. demonstrated that @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ was one of the most commonly isolated GPAC species and characteristics of Parvimonas spp. bacteremia (mostly @gm$ P. micra @/gm$) were discussed. However, due to historical difficulties with laboratory identification, there is a paucity of published data about the clinical characteristics or mortality due to bloodstream infection by @gm$ P. micra @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$ is a Gram-positive obligate anaerobe from the largely uncharacterized Tissierellia class of the Firmicutes phylum. Initially grouped within the Peptostreptococcus genus, a taxonomic reclassification revealed its distinction within the Firmicutes. @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is a common constituent of the microbiomes from multiple mucosal sites in the body, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and female urogenital tract. Epidemiological studies implicate @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ as a major human pathobiont. For example, it is both an exceptionally common and highly enriched species in numerous studies of different mucosal inflammatory diseases. In addition, @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ is among the most common sources of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) sepsis. It is also one of the most abundant species in numerous types of systemic @di$ abscesses @/di$, and it exhibits a surprisingly strong association with a variety of malignant tumors. In fact, @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ has even been proposed as a discriminating biomarker for colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and oral cancer. In the oral cavity, @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ exists as a low-abundance species during oral health but is highly enriched in periodontitis lesions and infected root canals and is especially prevalent in polymicrobial @di$ odontogenic abscesses @/di$.	1
@gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$ is a known commensal bacterium of the human oral flora and gastrointestinal tract. It is an obligate anaerobe, identified in 1933 as @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$. It was reclassified in 1999 as Mircomonas micros, and then in 2006 as @gm$ P. micra @/gm$. @di$ Infections @/di$ with @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ outside of the oral cavity are uncommon. Some case reports have isolated @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ from spinal abscesses, while others have found @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ as causative agents of meningitis, septic arthritis, chest wall abscess, spondylodiscitis, empyema, endocarditis, and brain abscess. A thorough literature search revealed no reports of hepatic infections with @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ in current literature.	1
@gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ is another probiotic species that belongs to family Lactobacillaceae. Several strains of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ has been extensively used for food preservation and also they displayed remarkable probiotic properties including an antimicrobial activity and regulation of @di$ inflammation @/di$ in animals.	2
@gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ synthesizes propionate from sugars and protects the colonic mucosa, reduces the effects of @di$ colitis @/di$, and increases the risk of colon cancer.	2
@gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ is a facultative, anaerobic, gram-negative rod that was recently classified in the family Enterobacteriaceae and is the only oxidase-positive member of this family. Similar to many Enterobacteriaceae species, @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ is found in a wide range of hosts, including cats, cows, dogs, pigs, and monkeys. In humans, @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ has been implicated in gastrointestinal infections, and the organism has also been shown to cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$, sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, keratitis, and other non-diarrheal diseases. In a recent extensive review of illnesses caused by @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$, little information was presented about the prevalence of P. shigelloides infections in China. We recently observed an association between @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ and infections involving gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal illnesses. Here, we provide a local perspective on the diseases caused by @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ in southeast China.	1
@gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ is a facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae, which also contains Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, and Klebsiella. It has been shown to cause gastroenteritis and diarrhea; severe disease can manifest as invasive colitis similar to shigellosis or voluminous secretory diarrhea. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, @di$ nausea @/di$, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea, and dehydration. The pathophysiology of infection with @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ remains unknown, although cytotoxin and enterotoxin-mediated damage has been proposed, and is still under investigation. A case of PMC, presenting with six months of bloody diarrhea, and attributed to @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ has been reported; the patient was treated with oral tetracycline after multiple positive stool cultures and improved rapidly.	1
@gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ is an oxidase-positive, anaerobic gram negative bacillus bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family which normally reside in soil and fresh water environments including the Great Lakes. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ is also distributed among warm- and cold-blooded animals like dogs and seafood. Its method of @di$ infection @/di$ is contamination of the gastrointestinal tract via consumption of raw fish or water-contaminated foods.	1
"@gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, previously classified in the genus Bacteroides, was a genus of an obligate anaerobic gram-negative rod-shape bacterium. They are classified as ""black pigmented bacteria"" as they form shiny and smooth colonies with grey, light brown or black color on blood agar plate. Although they generally have a limited ability to ferment amino acid and require hemin and menadione to grow, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is a versatile genus which has been observed in various niches, such as oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, urogenital tract, rumen and human feces. Many @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ taxa from oral cavity are potential/opportunistic pathogens. Gomes et al have shown that @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp is associated with pain and swelling and 'wet' canal of @di$ oral diseases @/di$. Besides, Prevotella intermdedia, Prevotella dentalis, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$, Prevotella meleninogenica are known to be pathogenic under a wide range of situations and invade into the host tissues."	1
@gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ is a widespread Gram-negative water and soil bacterium, which is, in addition, one of the most important opportunistic human pathogens causing severe infections in immunocompromised persons, such as burn wound, catheter and urinary tract infections or chronic pneumonia in @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ (CF) patients. Due to a large arsenal of intrinsic resistance mechanisms such as a low outer membrane permeability, the expression of antibiotic cleaving enzymes, and the existence of multidrug efflux pump systems, @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ is inherently resistant to various commonly used antibiotics.	1
@gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$ was first described in 1963 and belongs to fluorescent group of Pseudomonas. This microorganism is mainly recovered from rice seed samples, rice, and petroleum fields and oil brine and from the gills of some mollusks. These bacilli are an uncommon pseudomonal opportunistic pathogen causing very rare infection in human population. Until now, only two infections have been documented in humans: an isolate causing @di$ meningitis @/di$ in a 2-year-old girl after placement of a cerebral shunt system and an isolate causing bacteremia in a 56-year-old man who suffered a trauma. In our knowledge, we are describing the third case of infection by @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ in a patient with a trauma due to a traffic accident.	1
@gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ is a gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that rarely causes disease in humans. Documented infections can be severe with varying etiologies, often requiring intensive care. We describe a rare case of bacteremia with @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ in an elderly male, with a comprehensive review of the literature. An 81-year-old Caucasian male presented with bilateral lower leg erythema and drainage but was afebrile. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. Labs showed @di$ leukocytosis @/di$ and a blood culture was obtained revealing @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$. The pathogen was susceptible to all antibiotics tested and he was successfully treated on cefepime inpatient and a two-week course of ciprofloxacin on discharge. Our case and literature review presents a successful treatment of a rare cause of bacteremia likely stemming from a soft tissue nidus. @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ has a favorable susceptibility profile and the antibiotics preferred differ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a more common pathogen.	1
@gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ is a representative Roseburia species. Modification in Roseburia abundance may affect various metabolic pathways and is associated with several diseases, including IBS, ulcerative colitis, @di$ obesity @/di$, type 2 diabetes, nervous system disorders, and allergies. Diets that are high in fermentable carbohydrates increase the relative abundance of Roseburia, which are capable of degrading polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and sugars, indicating that fermentable carbohydrates might elevate the intestinal melatonin through increasing the abundance of Roseburia. Roseburia is characterized by SCFAs production, which can affect the intestinal epithelial barrier and regulate the function of innate immune cells through anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous study suggested that gavage of @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ prevented stressed rats from developing visceral hypersensitivity and increased the propionate and butyrate levels in cecal contents. In this study, SCFAs levels were measured in the intestinal contents after @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ treatment; thus, we found that propionate and butyrate levels significantly increased in both the cecum and colon (Figure 1).	2
@gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ is a gram-negative, capsulate, aerobic, and nonmotile bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriacae. Three species of @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$, initially classified as Klebsiella, exist, R. electrica, R. planticola, and R. terrigena. These bacteria have been isolated from aquatic environments, fish, and ticks, where it can produce histamine because of histidine decarboxylase enzyme and can contaminate food, especially not well conserved fish and pork. Histamine toxicity produces symptoms that include flushing of skin, headache, @di$ pruritus @/di$, and abdominal cramping. This rare but emergent bacterium can cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. For instance, human infections caused by @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ are rare but can be responsible for bacteraemia, especially in patient with malignancies and immunodeficiencies. Furthermore, @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ is responsible for urinary, bile tract, tracheal, bronchial, and lungs infections in patients with immunodeficiency. The majority of cases reported in the literature are community acquired infections, especially nosocomial. Neonatal sepsis is rare; however, it can be severe if not treated, as well as septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint. In a case report after an early but temporary response to the antibiotic therapy, this bacterium leads to a complete demolition of the articulation. @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ not only expresses beta-lactamase, which provides resistance to commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics but can also acquire genes for multi-drug resistance.	1
@gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ is one of the three species of @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$. The present case report describes a two-year-old child who had complaints of discomfort and @di$ fever @/di$, and @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ in his urinary culture.	1
@gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ was previously considered to be a rare opportunistic pathogen, which has not attracted enough attention from pediatricians. Currently, there are only few reports on children infected with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ all over the world, and none of the articles have ever provided a summary of the clinical characteristics of children infected with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. In our study, we reported five cases from an 1800-bed teaching hospital in southwest China, which is the largest number of children identified with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ to date. For the first time, together with the nine cases of @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ reported by others, we have summarized the clinical characteristics of the 14 cases infected with the bacteria in children. Unlike adults, children are mainly infected with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ through the blood stream rather than biliary, respiratory, or urinary tracts. Secondly, most of the newborns infected with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ also develop @di$ skin flushing @/di$ and systemic erythema, mainly due to the presence of histamine-like substances in @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$ is a butyrate producer whose abundance has been related to weight loss and a reduced @di$ glucose intolerance @/di$ in mice.	2
@gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ is a pathogenic species, the predominant microorganism in patients with @di$ aerobic vaginitis @/di$. Successful binding of these bacteria to extracellular matrix proteins, like fibronectin, fibrinogen and laminin plays an important role in their pathogenesis. The sag haemolysin of @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ has been described to initiate vaginal epithelial cell lysis.	1
@gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ is a normal microflora of the human gastrointestinal system; however, it is considered one of the most important public health concerns, and a major cause of bloody diarrhoea and HUS (@gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1) in humans. The serotype 1 of this organism is closely related to Escherichia coli serotype O157: H7, regarding the fact that both of these organisms can secret Stxs. Foodborne outbreaks caused by @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 are highly associated with the consumption of undercooked processed foods and vegetable salads. HUS is the only disease caused by S. dysenteriae type 1 infection, and the typical symptoms of this disease are @di$ renal failure @/di$, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. The fatality rate of this disease is 35%. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 adheres to the human colonic mucin and attaches to the epithelial cells by using the same mechanisms and virulence factor genes employed by other species. After attachment and adherence, Stxs are secreted by this organism. In addition to the presence of Stxs encoding genes, there are some minor differences between the virulence factors of @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 and other species of Shigella bacteria. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 uses type 2 secretion system (T2SS) as an effector delivery system to inject protein effectors into the host cell. This needle-like structure is encoded and expressed by gsp (A-O) genes in @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 also uses a specific heme uptake system as a protective virulence factor encoded by Shu genes. This mechanism mediates the direct binding of heme-containing proteins and the secretion of hemophores to provide iron for the organism during the pathogenesis and survival processes. This mechanism also protects the DNA of @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 from heme-mediated oxidative damage.	1
@gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ will infect the hard tissues of the teeth by fermentation and result in acid products. @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ have some characteristics such as the ability to attach to the enamel surface, produce metabolicity, and the ability to form biofilms producing extracellular polysaccharides substabce (EPS) and these properties support the occurrence of @di$ dental caries @/di$.	1
@gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ bacteriuria is rare and requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Prolonged shedding of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ in the urine can be seen after a @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$ (@di$ UTI @/di$) in patients with nephrolithiasis or urinary tract abnormalities, mandating long-term antibiotic therapy with a surgical opinion for source control.	1
@gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ species: A total of 19/260 (7.3%) @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ species were isolated from children with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$. Of these, 2(10.5%) Salmonella typhi, 3(15.8%) @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi A @/gm$ and 14(73.7%) @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ species were isolated.	1
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ (S. Choleraesuis) mainly causes swine paratyphoid in weaners younger than 4 months old, and can also cause food-borne diseases in humans. Septicemia is the typical acute clinical syndrome leading to death of piglets. However, most infected animals develop chronic infections characterized by @di$ wasting syndromes @/di$, such as malaise, anorexia, pyrexia, dyspnea, and pneumonia.	1

@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ (S. Choleraesuis), a highly invasive serovar among non-typhoidal Salmonella, usually causes @di$ sepsis @/di$ or extra-intestinal focal infections in humans.	1
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ is a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of infecting and replicating monocytes and macrophages. In swine, S. Choleraesuis invades the intestinal epithelium, produces enterocolitis, and colonizes the ileocecal lymph nodes (ICLN) and has the unique ability to disseminate to systemic sites, causing sepsis. A frequently affected organ is the lung, where the blood-borne infection with Salmonella manifests as interstitial pneumonia. Notably, in field cases, coinfection of swine with S. Choleraesuis and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been associated with more severe disease, including septicemic salmonellosis and severe @di$ pneumonia @/di$.	1
@gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ is an enteric pathogen of swine, producing septicemia, @di$ enterocolitis @/di$, pneumonia, and hepatitis. The initial molecular events at the site of Salmonella infection are hypothesized to be critical in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses; however, the acute immune response elicited by porcine intestinal tissues is not well understood. To address this need, we employed explants of jejunal Peyer's patch (JPP) mucosa from pigs to examine @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-induced immune responses under controlled conditions as well as to overcome limitations of whole animal approaches. JPP explants mounted in Ussing chambers maintained normal histological structure for 2 h and stable short-circuit current and electrical conductance for 2.5 h. After ex vivo luminal exposure to Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis, JPP responded with an increase in mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-8, but not TNFalpha. Increased IL-1beta and IL-8 expression were dependent on efficient @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ adhesion and internalization, whereas mutant @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ did not induce inflammatory cytokine expression. Commensal enteric bacteria, present in some experiments, also did not induce inflammatory cytokine expression. These findings indicate that @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ uptake by Peyer's patch is important in the induction of an innate response involving expression of IL-1beta and IL-8, and that ex vivo intestinal immune tissue explants provide an intact tissue model that will facilitate investigation of mucosal immunity in swine.	1

@gm$ Shigella @/gm$ are Gram-negative pathogenic enterobacteria that cause severe dysentery with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$, fever and stomach cramps. Humans are the main reservoir of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ and transmission occurs mainly through contaminated food or water via the faecal-oral route. The four subgroups Shigella flexneri, @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii exhibit differences in global distribution; while S. flexneri is the main pathogenic agent in childhood @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ affects the adult population of economically developed countries.	1
@gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species have been one of the most common causes of acute diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand. The incidence of shigellosis increased steadily from 1984 to 1988. The majority of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species isolated from specimens from patients with acute diarrhea in Bangkok in 1988 were resistant to both ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$ was the most commonly isolated organism and had the highest rate of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and tetracycline. The antimicrobial agents of choice for the treatment of shigellosis have been changed from ampicillin to TMP-SMZ and recently to the fluoroquinolones. We conducted a controlled study of norfloxacin that revealed its efficacy for eradication of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ species from the stool of both adults and children. The fluoroquinolones shorten the course of diarrhea, reduce the shedding of the organism, and prevent the spread of @di$ infection @/di$.	1
@gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$ belonging to the B subgroup of the genus is a well-known pathogen for primates, chiefly responsible for morbidity and mortality in colonized monkeys. Bloody diarrhea and mucus discharge is often accompanied with abdominal pain, tenesmus, @di$ fever @/di$, anorexia, weight loss and dehydration.	1
@gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$ remains a significant human pathogen due to high morbidity among children < 5 years in developing countries. One of the key features of Shigella infection is the ability of the bacterium to initiate actin tail polymerisation to disseminate into neighbouring cells. Dynamin II is associated with the old pole of the bacteria that is associated with F-actin tail formation. Dynamin II inhibition with dynasore as well as siRNA knockdown significantly reduced Shigella cell to cell spreading in vitro. The ocular mouse Sereny model was used to determine if dynasore could delay the progression of Shigella infection in vivo. While dynasore did not reduce ocular inflammation, it did provide significant protection against @di$ weight loss @/di$. Therefore dynasore's effects in vivo are unlikely to be related to the inhibition of cell spreading observed in vitro. We found that dynasore decreased @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$-induced HeLa cell death in vitro which may explain the protective effect observed in vivo.	1
@gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$ is an avirulent, coagulase-negative member of the staphylococci with the highest G+C content, and is commonly used as a starter culture for fermented sausages. The genome of @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$, an organism often regarded as an ancient and genetically simple species, generally has a lack of mobile genetic elements, especially in comparison with the other staphylococci. In contrast, Staphylococcus epidermidis is a coagulase-negative, opportunistic pathogen that is found as a part of the normal human flora of the skin and nares. S. epidermidis infections often occur through indwelling devices such as catheters, but are rarely life threatening or invasive. Staphylococcus aureus, also a normal part of the human flora, is a coagulase-positive member of the staphylococci, and is one of the leading causes of human infectious disease and death. S. aureus causes a wide variety of infections, ranging from minor @di$ cellulitis @/di$ to life-threatening sepsis, and is capable of infecting all organ systems.	0
@gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, a major pathogen of dental caries, can cause @di$ infective endocarditis @/di$ after invading the bloodstream. Recently, intravenous administration of specific @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ strains was shown to aggravate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a mouse model fed a high-fat diet. Here, we investigated the mechanism of this aggravation in a NASH mouse model by focusing on the @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ cell surface collagen-binding protein (Cnm) and the 190-kDa protein antigen (PA). Mice that were intravenously administered a @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ strain with a defect in Cnm (TW871CND) or PA (TW871PD) did not show clinical or histopathological signs of NASH aggravation, in contrast to those administered the parent strain TW871. The immunochemical analyses demonstrated higher levels of interferon-gamma and metallothionein expression in the TW871 group than in the TW871CND and TW871PD groups. Analysis of bacterial affinity to cultured hepatic cells in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids revealed that the incorporation rate of TW871 was significantly higher than those of TW871CND and TW871PD. Together, our results suggest that Cnm and PA are important cell surface proteins for the NASH aggravation caused by @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ adhesion and affinity for hepatic cells.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ (the pneumococcus) is a dominant cause of childhood illness and death worldwide. It has been estimated to cause ~800,000 deaths in children aged under 5 y annually, most due to @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and most in low-income countries.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ is a common cause of bacterial infections of the respiratory system, middle ear infection, @di$ bacteremia @/di$, meningitis, and pneumonia, especially in children. Due to the lack of information about the frequency and resistance of @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ to antibiotics, the present study was performed to determine the frequency of carriers of @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ and its microbial resistance in children.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ is a major cause of serious bacterial infections including meningitis, @di$ septicemia @/di$ and pneumonia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is a major swine pathogen responsible for @di$ septicemia @/di$, meningitis and other diseases in swine that often result in severe economic losses to the porcine industry. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is also an emerging zoonotic agent. Two outbreaks of human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ disease occurred in China in 1998 and 2005, affecting hundreds of people and killing more than forty. Relatively recent reports found that this pathogen is the first and second-most commonly reported cause of adult streptococcal meningitis in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively. On the other hand, in European countries, human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ disease has never been associated with large outbreaks, and has mostly affected workers in the swine industry. Relatively very few cases of human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ disease have been reported in North America. Most cases of animal and human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infection are caused by serotype 2 strains. Interestingly, the percentage of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotype 2 strains recovered from diseased pigs has historically been lower in North America than in other parts of the world.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is a major swine pathogen that causes severe diseases in pigs, inducing meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and endocarditis. Furthermore, @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is a zoonotic human pathogen affecting those in close contact with infected pigs or pig products. Several outbreaks in Southeast Asia highlighted its danger to public health. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotype 2 (SS2) is the most prevalent in human infections and is relatively well studied. However, little is known about other serotypes, such as @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotype 5 (SS5), which have arisen over recent decades. There have been four reported cases of human SS5 infections since 2011 around the world, including a patient with spontaneous @di$ bacterial peritonitis @/di$ in Thailand, a pig farmer with septic arthritis in Sweden, a pig farmer in United States with Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and a patient with bacteremia in Japan. Despite the low number of reported human cases, studying the occurrence and transmission of SS5 is important in light of the severity of the infections and the danger of the rise in antibiotic resistance. The abuse of antibiotics in multiple fields, including aquaculture and the food industry, and the genetic variation of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ via acquiring and transferring of genes, has resulted in an unprecedented rise of the antibiotic resistance phenomenon. Thus, it is critically important to better understand the characteristics of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ from both pathogenic and antibiotic-resistance perspectives.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is a pathogen of pigs that can cause infections in humans who are in close contact with infected animals and/or contaminated pork-derived products, as well as those who have consumed raw pork products. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ can cause @di$ meningitis @/di$, septicemia, endocarditis, and arthritis in humans. Human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ cases have been reported in most countries of Western Europe, North and South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan, and several other East and Southeast Asian countries, particularly China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Indeed, @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ has been shown to be responsible for thousands of human cases, of which 90.2% were in Asia, 8.5% in Europe, and 1.3% in other parts of the world.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is an emerging zoonotic human pathogen, which is a causative agent of @di$ invasive infections @/di$ in people who are in close contact with @di$ infected @/di$ pigs or contaminated pork products. It is associated with severe systemic infections, most commonly meningitis and sepsis, which may lead to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Serotype 2 is the most prevalent type in S. suis infections in humans. We have reported a case of a very rapidly proceeding fatal human S. suis infection in a splenectomized, but otherwise immunocompetent patient in Hungary. We would like to highlight the attention for this pathogen for the risk group patients, not only pig breeders, veterinarians, abattoir workers, meat processing and transport workers, butchers and cooks, that those persons who are immunocompromised including those with spleen removed, persons with diabetes mellitus, cancer and alcoholism, are also at greater risk of @di$ infection @/di$.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ is one of the most common Gram-positive cocci that usually colonizes the upper respiratory tract of pigs and can cause respiratory and systemic diseases, particularly in the postweaning period. In addition, it is also a serious zoonotic infection, causing @di$ meningitis @/di$ and toxic shock-like syndrome.	1
@gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. cholerae are serious human pathogens. V. cholerae probably has the greatest impact on human health, causing the acute @di$ diarrheal disease @/di$ cholera that can result in epidemics. It is a very persistent bacterium that can survive on a variety of vectors, including zooplankton and cyanobacteria. V. parahaemolyticus and @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ are food-borne pathogens associated with the ingestion of raw seafood. V. anguillarum, V. salmonicida, and @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ are important fish pathogens and are widespread in aquaculture settings, where conditions seem to enhance their virulence.	1
@gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ is a Gram-negative bacterium and the etiologic agent of the severe human diarrheal disease cholera. Cholera affects millions of individuals yearly, and causes over 100,000 deaths per year. The voluminous watery diarrhea and vomiting characteristic of cholera can rapidly lead to severe dehydration, @di$ hypovolemic shock @/di$, and death if left untreated, with case-fatality rates in excess of 50%.	1
@gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ has been associated with human diseases such as gastroenteritis, ear infections and severe cholera-like diarrhea; with symptoms such as diarrhea, nauseas, @di$ vomiting @/di$, abdominal pain and sometimes fever. This bacterium has been isolated from a large variety of seafood, such as oysters, turtle eggs, shrimp, crabs, snails, lobsters, and fish, as well in water samples, sediment and plants. Similar to other Vibrio species, @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ has two circular chromosomes of different size, a larger (ca. 3.0 Mb) chromosome and a smaller (ca. 1.5 Mb) chromosome. The genes required for growth and viability are in the larger chromosome, while the genes for adaptation to environmental change are in the smaller. Also, multiple virulence factors had been detected in both chromosomes, combinations of which regulated the pathogenic potential. The genetic diversity of Vibrio species, including @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, isolated form different sources has been documented. It has also been reported that @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ could represent the genetic reservoir of virulence genes for other Vibrio species or to be recipients of gene transfers.	1
@gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ is the causative agent of @di$ ascites disease @/di$ in fish. The heat-labile hemolytic toxin designated VMH is an immunoprotective antigen of @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ is a gram-negative halophilic bacterial species, first identified in 1950. Various serotypes of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ have been confirmed to be opportunistically pathogenic to humans, causing acute or subacute gastroenteritis accompanied with @di$ dehydration @/di$, chills, and fever, irrespective of age or gender. Primary symptoms can easily progress to severe @di$ dehydration @/di$, causing shock and other concomitant complications, which can even result in the death of immunocompromised patients, if not treated in a timely manner. Due to its wide existence in marine and terrestrial environments, @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ causes foodborne diseases worldwide. It is the only marine bacterium among the top five foodborne pathogens causing human infection. Although this bacterium was normally known to cause infections locally, since the past two decades, there have been reports of transcontinental distribution of certain @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ strains. There has been an increase in the number of clinical cases of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ infection, and sporadic or epidemic cases have been reported in some regions that were once considered unsuitable for the growth of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$, such as South America and Northern Europe. This suggests that @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ is continuously evolving and is developing into a more serious pathogen.	1
@gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$, the etiological agent of gastroenteritis, is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium mostly found in marine and estuarine habitats. Human infections occurs through the consumption of contaminated poorly cooked or raw seafood with clinical manifestations like diarrhea, nausea, @di$ vomiting @/di$ and abdominal cramping. @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ strains can also cause skin infection and septicemia if the bacterium enters into open wounds. @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ has been recognized as a leading cause of seafood associated gastroenteritis.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a Gram-negative halophile that thrives in warm marine and estuarine environments worldwide. @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ produces toxins and enzymes, including capsular polysaccharides, metalloproteases, lipopolysaccharides, and cytolysin. These toxins and enzymes cause extensive tissue damage and play a major role in the development of sepsis. @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ causes foodborne disease and wound infections. Primary septicemia caused by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is characterized by bacteremia without any obvious focus of infection and usually presents with a sudden onset of fever and chills, often accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and @di$ pain in the @/di$ extremities within 7 days after the ingestion of contaminated seafood. Within the first 24 h after the onset of illness, secondary cutaneous lesions such as cellulitis, ecchymosis proceeding to hemorrhagic bullae begin to appear on the extremities. This primary septicemia is the most lethal infection caused by V. vulnificus, with an average mortality rate exceeding 50%. In addition to septicemia, serious wound infection can be produced by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a Gram-negative, curved, obligate halophilic marine bacterium that exclusively exists in coastal seawaters. Previous studies revealed that @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is one of the most dangerous foodborne zoonotic pathogens for human beings. However, it remains unknown whether marine mammals can be infected by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$. In May 2016, a captive spotted seal (Phoca largha) died due to @di$ septicemia @/di$ induced by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$. Upon post-mortem examination, @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ was isolated, identified, and named as BJ-PH01. Further analysis showed that BJ-PH01 belongs to biotype 1 and the Clinical genotype. Furthermore, we performed an epidemiological investigation of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ in six aquariums in northern China. As a result, @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ was successfully isolated from all investigated aquariums. The positive rates ranged from 20% to 100% in each investigated aquarium. During the investigation, 12 strains of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ were isolated, and all 12 isolates were classified into biotype 1. Eleven of the 12 isolates belonged to the Clinical genotype, and one isolate belonged to the Environmental genotype. All 12 isolated @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ strains showed limited antibiotic resistance. Overall, our work demonstrated that @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is frequently distributed in aquariums, thus constituting a threat to captive marine mammals and to public health.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a gram-negative bacterium capable of producing @di$ septicemic infections @/di$ in eels and immunocompromised humans.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a natural inhabitant of estuarine waters. The three known biotypes include (i) most human pathogens, (ii) primarily eel pathogens, and (iii) pathogens associated with fish and with human @di$ wound infections @/di$ in Israel. Despite the frequently lethal consequences of V. vulnificus infections, the growth rates of the various biotypes and their response to environmental changes are not well characterized. We compared the specific growth rates (mu) of a representative of each biotype by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis in a defined medium under varied pH, temperature, and salinity. Growth rates based on culturable concentrations were always higher than those based on qPCR estimates; however, both enumeration methods yielded comparable results on the influence of environmental factors on growth rates. Temperature (25 C, 30 C, 37 C), pH (7.0, 8.0), and salinity (5 to 40%) all had significant effects on the mu of each biotype. Temperature had the greatest effect on the mu of biotype 1 (CMCP6), whereas salinity had the greatest effect on the mu of biotypes 2 (ATCC 33147) and 3 (302/99). The biotypes' growth rates varied significantly; biotype 1 grew most rapidly, while biotype 3 grew most slowly. The highest growth rates were achieved at 37 C, pH 7.0, and salinities of 15 to 30% (mu = 4.0, 2.9, and 2.4 generations h(-1) for biotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Other strains of the biotypes yielded comparable results, suggesting that the physiological responses of the biotypes are differentially affected by parameters that are highly variable both in estuarine environments and between the free-living and pathogen states of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$.	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ produces a variety of secreted virulence factors to cause severe life-threatening gastrointestinal and wound infections, most commonly from the consumption of contaminated seafood or swimming with an exposed wound. The primary @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ virulence factor associated with @di$ sepsis @/di$ and subsequent death is the composite Multifunctional-Autoprocessing Repeats-in-Toxin (MARTX) toxin encoded by the rtxA1 gene .	1
@gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$, a marine bacterium, is of concern in Taiwan because it causes wound infections and @di$ sepsis @/di$ with a high mortality rate every year. To examine for @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, 13 samples of seawater or oysters were collected from nine sites in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan. Seventy-seven strains of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ were isolated from 11 samples. Among these environmental isolates, 72 (91%) were indole-positive, a characteristic of biotype 1. The remaining five strains although indole-negative, a characteristic previously found exclusively in biotype 2 strains, were all ornithine decarboxylase- and mannitol-positive, which has never been reported for biotype 2 strains. Based on the overall biochemical reactions obtained using a commercial identification system, these indole-negative strains appeared to be more like biotype 1. Fifty-seven ribotypes were identified among these isolates, indicating the great genetic divergence in this species. Of the 30 environmental isolates tested, 17 (56.7%) exhibited virulence comparable to the clinical isolates in the mouse, implying that a high proportion of the @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ strains in the marine environments might be pathogenic to humans.	1
@gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ and Yersinia enterocolitica are ubiquitous pathogens with wildlife and domestic animal reservoirs. Outbreaks of 'non-plague' yersiniosis in man and non-human primates are reported frequently (including zoological specimens and research breeding colonies) and are usually characterized by enteritis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and occasionally organ abscessation. In people, non-septic reactive arthritis is a common sequela to yersiniosis. However, there have been rare reports in people of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis because of active systemic infection with @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$. Osteomyelitis has also been reported rarely in historical yersiniosis outbreaks in farmed turkeys in England and the USA. This paper reports the first case of osteomyelitis caused by systemic infection with @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ O:1 in a non-human primate, a captive ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). The lemur had a short clinical history of hyporexia and @di$ weight loss @/di$ with reduction in mobility, especially of the left hindlimb.	1
@gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ is a rare pathogen that causes yersiniosis, a foodborne disease that has become more prevalent in recent years. Yersiniosis commonly causes gastrointestinal symptoms; however, bacteremia can be the primary clinical finding. Here, we report the case of an 83-year-old man who presented with fever and fatigue and was diagnosed with Y. pseudotuberculosis bacteremia. Gastrointestinal findings were absent at the time of admission. His condition was complicated by @di$ rhabdomyolysis @/di$, which was self-limiting and resolved spontaneously. This case reveals that fever may be the only clinical sign of invasive yersiniosis and that it can be complicated by @di$ rhabdomyolysis @/di$. Clinicians should consider @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ as a potential causative pathogen in patients with a fever of unknown origin and @di$ rhabdomyolysis @/di$.	1
@gm$ jejuni @/gm$ is the leading bacterial cause of foodborne gastroenteritis in developed countries, primarily because of its ability to colonize the ceca of chickens and to survive in the food chain by attaching to undercooked chicken meat. C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ readily colonizes the gastrointestinal tracts of a wide variety of wild and domestic birds and other animals. Infections in poultry are usually asymptomatic, while human infection can cause significant inflammation, fever, headache, chill, abdominal pain, @di$ nausea @/di$, and diarrhea, occasionally progressing to the autoimmune neuropathies, including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ is also implicated in the development of irritable bowel disease. Disease phenotypes, including diarrhea, are less severe in developing countries than in developed countries. In addition, in developing countries, campylobacteriosis is more frequent among children than adults, suggesting that immunity to @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ might be naturally acquired as children become adults.	1
A 2018 study highlighted the anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ effect of a formulation with L. Rhamnosus, B. lactis and @gm$ B. longum @/gm$. In a very recent 2020 study, the authors report that the administration of @gm$ Bifidobacterium Longum @/gm$ BB536 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 improves the symptoms and severity of IBS, restores intestinal permeability, and the microbiota.	2
A 52-year-old woman with a 3-week history of fever and @di$ cough @/di$ was diagnosed as having bacterial endocarditis with vegetation and severe mitral valve insufficiency by echocardiography. Blood culture revealed @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$.	1
A 65-year-old woman who underwent kidney transplantation six months prior presented to our emergency room with progressive @di$ paraparesis @/di$. She had been diagnosed with drug-susceptible miliary TB and had undergone two weeks of treatment with anti-TB medication. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a spinal intramedullary mass and multiple intracranial nodules. The etiology of the lesions was confirmed as @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$.	1
A 73-year-old woman presented with fever, @di$ jaundice @/di$, hepatomegaly and cellulitis. Microorganisms isolated from both skin lesion and blood were biochemically and serologically identified as @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$, biotype 4, serotype 3 and lysotype 9b.	1
A 75-year-old man was admitted because of a fever, severe abdominal pain and @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$. He was negative for anti-HIV antibodies. He had been in close contact with a dog earlier. Abdominal computed tomography detected severe wall-thickening and fat-stranding of the entire colon accompanied by portal venous gas. A smear examination of his stool showed many Gram-negative spiral rods, suggesting intestinal spirochetosis. A polymerase chain reaction assay using stool samples detected an amplified band specific for @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$.	1
A Chinese study reported a prevalence of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ in only 6.3% (4/64) of examined @di$ UC @/di$ samples. Our data confirm that the bacteria are not common in the colonic mucosa of patients with @di$ UC @/di$, as we detected it in less than 2% (1/56) of the @di$ UC @/di$ samples. The single positive sample was obtained from a patient suffering from @di$ UC @/di$ at a highly active state, which could mean that @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ had been attracted by the active inflammation of this area, or @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ had induced the active inflammation.	1
A Gram-negative, motile, oxidase-positive, and facultatively anaerobic rod, @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, these bacteria might also be discovered in temperate and cold climates' freshwater habitats. Over the past several years, the gastrointestinal sickness associated with @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ has garnered growing attention, particularly in children, the elderly, and those with impaired immune systems. It has also been linked to travel-related @di$ diarrhea @/di$ andpolluted water, normally from consuming raw or undercooked crabs and shellfish. For a long time, @gm$ Plesiomonas @/gm$ was considered a part of the Vibrionaceae family; however, it has now been reclassified as an Enterobacteriaceae member. Aeromonas and @gm$ Plesiomonas @/gm$ are both members of the Vibrionaceae family, which typically inhabits the aquatic environment. Freshwater and estuary habitats are home to the lone known species of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$. When it enters the body by water or food, it can produce mild watery @di$ diarrhea @/di$ to more severe dysentery-like @di$ diarrhea @/di$, which can be acute or chronic and vary from mild to moderate to severe. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ has several characteristics with other pathogenic vibrios, such as disease symptoms and enrichment medium.	1
A bacterial strain, designated WCA-9-b2T, was isolated from the caecal content of an 18-week-old @di$ obese @/di$ C57BL/6NTac male mouse. According to phenotypic analyses, the isolate was rod-shaped, strictly anaerobic, spore-forming, non-motile and Gram-stain-positive, under the conditions tested. Colonies were irregular and non-pigmented. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the isolate belonged to the order Clostridiales with Dorea longicatena ATCC 27755T (94.9 % sequence identity), Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149T (94.8%) and Clostridium scindens ATCC 35704T (94.3%) being the closest relatives. Whole genome sequencing showed an average nucleotide identity <74.23 %, average amino acid identity <64.52-74.67 % and percentage of conserved proteins values <50 % against the nine closest relatives (@gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$, Ruminococcus gnavus, C.	0
A bacteriological study of isolates from the oral cavity of patients with @di$ Kawasaki disease @/di$ (@di$ KD @/di$), age-matched non-@di$ KD @/di$ patients and healthy children, showed that over half the @di$ KD @/di$ and control isolates had gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci. About 50% of these organisms were identified as viridans streptococci by means of an API Strep 20 kit. Further identification by fluorometric DNA-DNA hybridisation demonstrated that the predominant species were S. oralis and @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, each of which accounted for 25% of the isolates of viridans streptococci; 40% of viridans strains were unidentifiable; and S. sanguis and S. parasanguis were minor components. Studies in vivo showed that insertion of culture supernates of most of the viridans streptococci increased capillary permeability and induced redness with swelling and occasional bleeding in rabbit skin. One-third of @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ strains and one-fifth of the unidentified strains caused aggregation of human blood platelets, whereas S. oralis and other strains had no such effect. The distribution of extracellular lipoteichoic acids and glucan produced in the presence of sucrose was also examined. There were no significant differences in the recovery rate of viridans streptococci forming these biologically active extracellular products between @di$ KD @/di$ and control groups.	0
A case of @di$ septicaemia @/di$ caused by @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ is described. The role played by pediococci, and other vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, in disease states is examined. We suggest that in immunocompromised patients these organisms act as opportunist pathogens. This would appear to be the first reported case of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ @di$ septicaemia @/di$.	1
A case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and @di$ brain abscess @/di$ is described. A CT scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A culture from a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and Staphylococcus simulans. From the pus of the @di$ brain abscess @/di$ we also isolated numerous @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and some Prevotella buccae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. No aerobes were present. The patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. The antimicrobial therapy included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. The result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. This is the first documentation of isolation of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ in chronic otitis media and in @di$ brain abscess @/di$.	1
A cross-sectional study of 41 children aged 4-17 years with @di$ alopecia areata @/di$ and 41 of their siblings without @di$ alopecia areata @/di$ was conducted. A total of 51% had the Severity of Alopecia Tool scores in the range of 0-25%, 12% had scores between 26% and 49%, and 36% had scores between 75% and 100%. The fecal microbiome was characterized using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A comparison of alpha and beta diversity yielded a small but statistically significant difference on the basis of Jaccard distance, which measures species presence and absence between samples. However, a follow-up analysis did not reveal the particular species that were present more often in one group. The relative abundance of one species, @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$, was decreased in patients with @di$ alopecia areata @/di$ relative to that in their sibling controls. An analysis of gene ortholog abundance identified 20 orthologs that were different between groups, including spore germination genes and genes for metal transportation. The associations reported in this study support a view of pediatric @di$ alopecia areata @/di$ as a systemic disease that has effects on hair but also leads to internal changes, including differences in the gut microbiome.	2
A defect in the human gene encoding succinyl-CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase causes a metabolic disease which leads to severe @di$ ketoacidosis @/di$, thus reflecting the importance of this family of enzymes. All CoA-transferases share a common mechanism in which the CoA moiety is transferred from a donor (e.g. acetyl CoA) to an acceptor, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, whereby acetate is formed. The transfer has been described by a ping-pong mechanism in which CoA is bound to the active-site residue of the enzyme as a covalent thiol ester intermediate. We describe here the crystal structure of glutaconate CoA-transferase (GCT) from the strictly anaerobic bacterium @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$.	0
A field isolate of @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$, the aetiological agent of porcine intestinal spirochaetosis, was inoculated by stomach tube into six 6-week-old pigs. All animals developed loose to watery faeces and were killed successively on days 8, 14 or 17 post-inoculation (day 17 being the end of the study). Mild mucosal reddening and flecks of pus characterized the gross lesions, while diffuse, catarrhal @di$ colitis @/di$ was revealed microscopically in all animals. Intestinal spirochaetosis with moderate to densely packed end-attached @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ organisms was revealed extensively on the mucosal surface of the large intestines by light microscopy and fluorescent in situ hybridization. This study is the first to report extensive intestinal spirochaetosis in pigs challenged with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$.	1
A great number of studies have revealed that @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ and Verrucomicrobia are very rare or not detected in the digestive tract of dogs. Some reasons might be inadequate sequence depth, the primers, 16S rRNA probes, or the reference sequence database. This was also demonstrated by the very low relative abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in fecal samples from healthy and @di$ obese @/di$ beagles in our study.	0
A growing body of evidence indicates that host genetic factors are involved in susceptibility to a variety of bacterial pathogens, including meningococci, @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ , and leprosy. Similar evidence also exists for genetic susceptibility to S. aureus. For example, higher rates of invasive S. aureus infection have been described in ethnically distinct populations, including Australian Aborigines, New Zealand Maori, and Canadian Native Americans. Using a murine S. aureus @di$ sepsis @/di$ model, Ahn et al.	1
A high concentration of acetic acid may prevent the synthesis of fat, which may contribute to @di$ obesity @/di$. Propionic acid can be absorbed in the colon and further positively influence liver function and cholesterol metabolism. Butyric acid can serve as an energy source for colonic epithelium. Furthermore, it can control growth and apoptosis of both epithelial and immune cells and inhibit colitis and colonic cancers. Overall, these results demonstrated that the series of long-chain IMOs obtained from @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ strain AP-1 can promote the growth of beneficial probiotic bacteria and enhance the production of SCFAs, such as acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid.	2
A higher diversity of bacterial strains was obtained from @di$ diabetic @/di$ mice compared with non-@di$ diabetic @/di$ mice (Figures 4C and 4D). Cultivated strains included species from the Firmicutes (@gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ spp., Bacillus spp.) and from Proteobacteria (Escherichia sp., Enterobacter spp.) phyla, commonly present in the human skin environment. It has been reported that @di$ diabetic @/di$ patients have increased bacterial diversity, in which decreased @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ spp.	2
A large variety of bacteria, including potentially pathogenic bacteria like Brucella sp., @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$, Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. Those bacteria were associated with bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, myocarditis and @di$ septicemia @/di$.	1
"A literature search was performed on PubMed using the terms ""@gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$"" and ""@gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ infection."" The query returned 14 case reports of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$-related infections in humans. Additional case reports were identified by cross-referencing previously discovered case reports. A total of 20 cases of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$-related infections were documented. Seven were from Asia (Taiwan, Singapore, and India), three were from Europe (Denmark, France, and Portugal), two were from the Middle East (Israel and Turkey), four were from North America (USA), and two were from South America (Argentina. @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ can cause various infections, including infective endocarditis, @di$ meningitis @/di$, skin and soft tissue infections (burn wound infections, leg wound infections, and spondylodiscitis), peritonitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia. Ours is the fifth case report of P. mendocina infection in the United States and the first documented case of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ urinary tract infection. A systematic literature review by Ioannou and Vougiouklakis in 2020 demonstrated that previous cases of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ had low mortality. No deaths directly attributed to @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$ were reported."	1

A non-significant decrease in @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ from 7 2 to 5 3 % was observed in the healthy group which could be due to already high levels at baseline. Other studies have observed depleted @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ in irritable bowel syndrome patients compared with healthy control subjects. It has been demonstrated that the effect of baseline concentrations of a bacterial group may have a substantial bearing on the magnitude of effect observed in response to a dietary intervention. @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ abundance was significantly elevated (3 6 %) in the FC group after a 4-week period of supplementation with the gold kiwifruit-based Livaux . @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ is one of the more populous species in the human gastrointestinal tract, being typically observed at over 5 % of the total proportion of the colonic microbiota of healthy adults, in agreement with abundance data presented in this study. Members of the Firmicutes phylum, @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ are commensal inhabitants of the human large bowel, with demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. One study found that @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ was able to utilise pectin and uronic acids as substrates for growth and both are known constituents of kiwifruit. Green and gold kiwifruit have been shown to exhibit differences in digestibility, leading to altered soluble and insoluble fibre compositions reaching the large bowel, which may be why differences were observed in the effect of green and gold kiwifruit fibre in this study. Low amounts of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ have been associated with a range of intestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, @di$ atopy @/di$, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These consistent observations show that a depleted concentration of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ is an undesirable endpoint and therefore any treatment that can selectively stimulate its proliferation in situ is likely to be a promising intervention strategy.	2
A novel bacterium was characterized from appendiceal tissues samples from children with appendicitis and in 2 cases of perirectal and @di$ brain abscesses @/di$ associated with other anaerobes. With routine tests, this organism resembled members of the Bacteroides fragilis group; however, the cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-C15:0 and production of brown pigment on media containing hemolyzed blood suggested that the organism was most closely related to the genus Porphyromonas. However, 16S rDNA sequence comparison showed highest sequence relatedness with B. putredinis, and the reclassification of B. putredinis in a novel genus, Alistipes, and the classification of the novel bacterium as @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ were proposed. A. putredinis was characterized in the indigenous flora of the human gut. The natural habitat of @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ is unknown but is probably the same.	0
A panel of fifty gut bacterial strains was screened for their ability to reduce pro-inflammatory IL-6 secretion in U373 @di$ glioblastoma astrocytoma @/di$ cells. Parabacteroides distasonis MRx0005 and @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ MRx0029 had the strongest capacity to reduce IL-6 secretion in vitro.	2
A previous 16S rRNA sequencing study demonstrated that the depletion of Blautia was pronounced in the gut microbiota of @di$ obese @/di$ children, especially in those with insulin resistance. The relative abundance of Blautia was inversely associated with the visceral fat area, which is a risk factor strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. Correspondingly, a randomized controlled-feeding trial revealed that a lower-fat diet was associated with an increased abundance of Blautia . In our study, we found that @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$, which was reclassified as @gm$ Blautia obeum @/gm$ comb. nov in 2015, was negatively related to the composite endpoint of ACS patients through the mediation of PLP1969 (nervonic acid) and PLP1689 (docosanamide). Nervonic acid (HMDB0002368) is a long chain unsaturated fatty acid that is enriched in sphingomyelin. Docosanamide (HMDB0000583) is a carboxylic acid amide derivative of fatty acids. The biosynthesis of both metabolites remains to be illustrated. Except for endogenous synthesis and food, it has been reported that bacterial production could be a source of nervonic acid. In terms of biological function, @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$ (ASV452) was found to be strongly correlated with the pathway of methanogenesis from acetate predicted by PICRUSt2. In addition, @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$ has been reported as a propionate producer.	2
A previous study showed that there is a reduced abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in obese humans. Interestingly, others discovered that @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ was less abundant in the intestinal microbiota of both genetic and diet-induced obese and diabetic mice. @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ spp. abundance was markedly increased in HFD-fed mice treated with berberine. @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ treatment was shown to reverse metabolic disorders induced by high-fat diets, including fat-mass gain, @di$ metabolic endotoxemia @/di$, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). The administration of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ was also shown to increase the intestinal levels of endocannabinoids that control inflammation, the gut barrier, and the secretion of peptides in the gut. Increased levels of colonization by @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ were also shown to induce the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors and apolipoprotein E in the hepatocytes of CREBH-null mice (C57BL/6J). This facilitated the uptake of intermediate-density lipoprotein via the mediation of apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E, thus leading to the increased clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants, chylomicron remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins, from general circulation. The oral administration of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ also improved hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress and metabolic inflammation in CREBH-null mice.	2
A previous study, using the dextran sulfate sodium-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ (DSS-@di$ colitis @/di$) rat model, has demonstrated that resveratrol treatment (1 mg/kg/day for 25 days) provides beneficial effects on the colon, including altering the expression of inflammation-associated genes, protecting the colonic mucosa architecture, and modulating intracellular signaling such as NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In addition, resveratrol administration can also restore normal intestinal microbiota in bacterial composition under DSS treatment. These include some anti-inflammatory gut microbiota, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. More recently, Wellman et al. reported that aged mice with deletion of Sirtuin1 in the intestinal epithelium (SIRT1 iKO mice) exhibited a reduced abundance of Bacilli, particularly @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$. Compared to wild-type DSS-@di$ colitis @/di$ mice, aged SIRT1 iKO mice experienced enhanced rectal bleeding, increased colonic shortening, and elevated colonic crypt erosion after DSS challenge.	2
A previously healthy 39-year-old woman had a short, febrile illness that culminated in severe, acute renal failure in association with features of the @di$ nephrotic syndrome @/di$. @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$ was isolated from her blood and stool.	1
A previously uncharacterized genus Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium was largely depleted in @di$ obese @/di$ cat gut microbiota (from 0.383% to <0.001%, FDR = 0.012), which was the most decreased species in the @di$ obese @/di$ cat microbiome. Similarly, the abundance of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ dropped from 0.078% in normal cats to <0.001% in @di$ obese @/di$ cats. We validated the dramatic decreases in both Erysipelotrichaceae and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ by qPCR. Moreover, the increased abundance of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ was proved to be associated with successful weight loss in the Mayo Clinic study.	2
A recipient of a renal homograft developed disseminated infection caused by @gm$ Mycobacterium kansaii @/gm$. He initially presented with cellulitis and @di$ abscesses @/di$ in one foot, and was thought to have a pyogenic bacterial infection.	1
A role for intestinal archaea in the @di$ dysbiosis @/di$-asthma paradigm was recently suggested by a study in a subset of 472 children from the KOALA birth cohort in the Netherlands. The presence of @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ in stool samples from 6- to 10-year-old children has been associated in a dose-dependent manner with a reduced risk of being diagnosed with asthma . This effect was independent of parental asthma status. Only 8.3% of samples tested in this study were positive for @gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$, however, and certain archaeal proteins have actually been proposed to have pro-inflammatory or allergenic properties. Thus, more cohort studies and mechanistic studies into the immunomodulatory effects of gut archaea in the context of asthma are needed. As in the case of the other microbial communities discussed in this review, the microbial and immune context within which disrupted archaeal communities occur likely determine the ultimate immunological consequences for the host. Furthermore, as the human lung microbiota in childhood and adults continues to be characterized, the role of lung archaea in the @di$ dysbiosis @/di$-asthma paradigm will need to be determined.	2
A septic screen test was performed that would determine that @gm$ Streptococcus pasteurianus @/gm$ was present in a blood culture (BC), which was not valued. About three months later, she was hospitalized. In the first 24 hours of admission, the septic screen test was repeated and @gm$ Streptococcus pasteurianus @/gm$ was isolated in BC. @di$ Splenic infarctions @/di$ and transthoracic echocardiography suggested probable endocarditis, which was confirmed with transesophageal echocardiography.	1
A similar situation has also occurred in Europe, where in 2017, seven member states of the European Union reported 27 @di$ waterborne @/di$ outbreaks caused by different microorganisms, including calicivirus (norovirus), @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, Cryptosporidium, hepatitis virus, 'Viruses other than hepatitis A virus and Calicivirus, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, parasites (other than Cryptosporidium and Trichinella) and unknown agents. Between January 2011 and December 2016, 381 @di$ waterborne @/di$ outbreaks due to parasitic protozoa (e.g., Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp.) were reported worldwide.	1
A study in diabetic mice identified beneficial effects of supplementation with @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ in ischemia/reperfusion-induced @di$ brain injury @/di$ after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Treatment with @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ decreased neuronal injury and improved the cognitive functions.	2
A sub-group analysis of the patients with UC was performed which found no definite relationship between extent of disease and the prevalence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ and specifically C. concisus. There was a significantly lower prevalence of all Campylobacters in subjects with severe colitis (50%) as opposed to moderate colitis (87.5%), but no such difference was noted with the prevalence of C. concisus infection. The obvious corollary to this finding is that our study did not have the power to detect differences between the various sub-groups of UC. This finding appears to be against the obvious premise that a greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. Contrary to this finding, a greater prevalence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species was noted in histologically inflamed biopsies as opposed to normal biopsy samples taken from UC patients. One can surmise that there can be regional changes in mucosal bacterial species, in this case @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, that may trigger an @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cascade which then leads to ulceration and loss of the epithelial surface that harbours these organisms. This would paradoxically lead to reduced identification of the pathogen in the most severe phases of active disease. Future studies should also be conducted on non-IBD @di$ inflammatory @/di$ colonic diseases to ensure that the presence of the bacteria is not merely a superinfection of inflamed tissue.	1
A total of 19 @di$ overweight @/di$/obese participants were assigned to 20%-40% reduced calories low-carbohydrate high-fat diet for four weeks. Protein and fat content in the composed diet was 1.5 times higher compared to that in the average diet of the normal weight reference group, while carbohydrate content was 2 times lower. Food consumption data were obtained from the assigned meals. Microbial composition was analyzed before and after WLD intervention from two sequential samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. During WLD, body mass index (BMI) was reduced on average 2.5 +- 0.6 kg/m2 and stool frequency was normalized. The assigned diet induced significant changes in fecal microbiota. The abundance of bile-resistant bacteria (Alistipes, Odoribacter splanchnicus), @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$, Butyricimonas, and Enterobacteriaceae increased.	0
A total of 4,910 Northern European descendants were enrolled in the @di$ Dental Atherosclerosis @/di$ Risk in Communities (DARIC) Cohort as described. Blood was collected as described for genotyping for ~2.5 million markers. GCF was collected at 4 gingival sampling areas from the mesio-buccal region of each first molar from each individual and stored for further analysis of IL-1beta levels. Plaque samples were collected from the subgingival mesio-buccal site of the maxillary right first molar, and stored for further DNA whole chromosomal checkerboard for the 8 periodontal pathogens. Periodontal measurements (n=4,766) in all teeth at 6 sites per tooth were collected and included number of missing teeth, gingival index (GI), plaque index (@gm$ PI @/gm$), probing depths (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP).	0
A total of 43 species were inversely correlated with glycemic, @di$ atherogenic @/di$ and/obesity risk factors (p < 0.05), including most species enriched in the Reference group (Figure 7). A total of 18 gut microbial species were positively correlated with 3,8-dihydroxy-urolithin-derivatives (p < 0.05). Out of 10 gut microbial species enriched in the Reference group, four species (B. dorei, C. eutactus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$) were positively correlated with 3,8-dihydroxy-urolithin derivatives (p < 0.05), but none of the PreDM-IR enriched species were correlated with 3,8-dihydroxy-urolithin (Figure 7).	2
A total of 58 bacterial isolates including @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (@gm$ ORT @/gm$) (n = 22), Gallibacterium anatis biovar haemolytica (n = 19) and Avibacterium endocarditidis (n = 17) were investigated. @gm$ ORT @/gm$ is an emerging @di$ respiratory pathogen @/di$.	1
A total of 75 peptides were found in @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ LH-2 CFSM, 19 of these peptides have previously been associated with several categories of bioactivity (ACE-inhibitory, opioid, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities). For L. acidophilus La-5 CFSM, a total of 15 peptides were sequenced, 5 of these peptides have previously been reported with ACE-inhibitory, antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-@di$ caries @/di$ activities.	2
A total of 79 @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ strains isolated from diseased pigs on non-related farms in Canada were used in this study (Additional file 1). All strains have been isolated from primary affected organs of clinically diseased pigs, including brain (meningitis; n = 18), heart (endocarditis; n = 18), multiple organs (septicemia; n = 14), pleura (@di$ polyserositis @/di$; n = 9), lungs (pneumonia; n = 9) and joints (arthritis; n = 1). For a very few isolates, the information was not available, but they were all recovered from diseased animals with a primary diagnosis of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infection. All isolates were serotyped using the coagglutination test. Chromosomal DNA was prepared from all strains as previously described. The species identity of the 79 strains was determined to be @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ by amplification of the 16S rRNA, recN, gdh, and thrA genes.	1
A variety of studies have highlighted the association of gut microbiota (GM) with endocrine diseases, such as @di$ obesity @/di$, which is commonly associated with ICPP. However, the relationship between GM and ICPP remains unexplored. Feces samples were collected from 25 girls with ICPP (ICPP group) and 23 healthy girls (Control group). We applied 16S rDNA sequencing to compare the GM between two groups. The ICPP group had higher GM diversity and was enriched for several GM species, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus callidus, @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$, Roseburia inulinivorans, Coprococcus eutactus, Clostridium leptum, and Clostridium lactatifermentans, which are known to be associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ and are related to the production of short-chain fatty acids.	1
AAC is believed to have a more fulminate course, frequently associated with gangrene, @di$ perforation @/di$, and abscess, as well as significantly higher morbidity and mortality especially in older patient. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential because ischemia may progress rapidly to gangrene and @di$ perforation @/di$. If an operation was performed within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms, severe complications would be reduced. We report a case of 65-old- year men, who presented with signs of acute abdomen, due to biliary peritonitis as a complication of an acute acalculouscholecystitis caused by @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$.	1
AIM: A randomized-controlled clinical pilot trial was designed to evaluate photodynamic therapy (PDT) for its bactericidal potential and clinical effect in the treatment of @di$ periodontitis @/di$. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-eight subjects with chronic periodontitis were included. Each subject exhibited at least three active periodontal pockets 5mm or deeper, bleeding on probing and the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Subjects were randomly assigned to a control group treated by subgingival ultrasound only or to a study group additionally treated by PDT. Baseline clinical values of gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depths and clinical attachment levels were recorded and re-evaluated 90 days later. Pathogen screening for P. gingivalis, @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ and Treponema denticola was conducted at baseline as well as 10, 42 and 90 days after treatment. RESULTS: P. gingivalis was significantly reduced in both groups (laser group: p=0.020; control group: p=0.042). No significant reductions of @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ and T.	1
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic combination in the treatment of @di$ gingivitis @/di$ and to assess its impact on the subgingival microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in @di$ gingivitis @/di$ subjects during 6 weeks. Test treatment consisted of the administration of two oral tablets per day containing the probiotic strains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$; the control group received the same tablets but without live bacteria. The main outcome variable was the changes in gingival index (GI). Subgingival samples were collected and analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for five putative periodontal pathogens. Outcome variables were compared between and within groups, and multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients (29 tests, 30 placebos) were included in the analysis. Both treatment groups experienced a statistically significant improvement in mean GI (p < .0001), but no differences between treatment groups were found for any clinical index. A significantly higher reduction in the number of sites with higher GI scores (GI = 3 at baseline) was observed in the test group. In subgingival samples, a significant reduction in T. forsythia was significant only in the test group (p < .008). CONCLUSIONS: The use of probiotic tablets containing L. plantarum, L. brevis and @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ did not lead to significant changes in mean GI; although a significant reduction occurred in the number of sites with severe inflammation.	2
AIMS/BACKGROUND: We attempted to measure the generation of superoxide anion, examine its site of release and determine its pathological role in @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$-lipopolysaccharide-induced @di$ liver injury @/di$ in the rat. METHODS: The @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$-pretreated (16 mg/kg i.v.) rat liver was perfused with buffer containing lipopolysaccharide (2.5 microg/ml). Chemiluminescence enhanced with Cypridina luciferin analog, MCLA, and reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium were used for detecting superoxide anion. Leakage of enzymes and release of cytokines into the perfusate, and histological specimens were also examined. RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence peaked at 30 min of lipopolysaccharide infusion and blue formazan precipitate was histochemically deposited mainly on hepatic macrophages. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) activity in the perfusate, as a marker of sinusoidal endothelial cell injury, reached its maximum at 50 min and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, as a marker of hepatocyte injury, reached a plateau at 90 min. Simultaneous treatment with superoxide dismutase and deferoxamine mesylate significantly suppressed the leakage of PNP and AST. Release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and growth-related oncogene/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 lagged behind PNP leakage. Light microscopy showed destruction of the sinusoids followed by hepatocyte necrosis. Electron microscopy revealed adherence of hepatic macrophages to sinusoidal endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that superoxide anion released from hepatic macrophages may induce sinusoidal endothelial cell injury via interaction with iron in the @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$-lipopolysaccharide-treated liver.	1
AIMS: Colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$. We investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of Bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 Chinese @di$ lactose-intolerant @/di$ subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides group in faeces as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. The number of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. With PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ and B. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. The degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in @di$ lactose-intolerant @/di$ subjects. The changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$.	2
AIMS: To determine whether dosing with bacteriocin-producing @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ following an antimicrobial mouthwash effects a change in oral malodour parameters and in the composition of the oral microbiota of subjects with @di$ halitosis @/di$. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects with @di$ halitosis @/di$ undertook a 3-day regimen of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouth rinsing, followed at intervals by the use of lozenges containing either S. salivarius K12 or placebo. Assessment of the subjects' volatile sulphur compound (VSC) levels 1 week after treatment initiation showed that 85% of the K12-treated group and 30% of the placebo group had substantial (>100 ppb) reductions. The bacterial composition of the saliva was monitored by culture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Changes in the PCR-DGGE profiles occurred in most subjects following K12 treatment. In vitro testing showed that S. salivarius K12 suppressed the growth of black-pigmented bacteria in saliva samples and also in various reference strains of bacteria implicated in @di$ halitosis @/di$. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of bacteriocin-producing @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ after an oral antimicrobial mouthwash reduces oral VSC levels. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The outcome of this preliminary study indicates that the replacement of bacteria implicated in @di$ halitosis @/di$ by colonization with competitive bacteria such as S. salivarius K12 may provide an effective strategy to reduce the severity of @di$ halitosis @/di$.	2
According to Balcells et al., flavonoid supplementation may improve rumen fermentation and reduce the incidence of @di$ rumen acidosis @/di$. The present study confirmed this activity of CAL flavonoids (2.21 g/kg DM) by demonstrating increased pH values in the lamb rumen. It should be realized that the CAL contained three types of BAC with distinct activities: flavonoids, diterpenes and phenolic acids but the mechanism described above is typical for flavonoids. Such flavonoid activity partially explains the findings of the present study on the increased number of lactate-consuming microorganisms (e.g., @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$).	2
According to Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp. account for 9% of total foodborne illnesses, 15% of hospitalizations and 0.1% of deaths from foodborne illnesses each year. In immunocompetent patients, C. jejuni infection typically manifests as a self-limiting acute gastroenteritis characterized by severe watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea, fever, nausea, and @di$ vomiting @/di$.	1
According to our previous study, @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ is also the predominant species (70.8%; 208/294) cultured from infant foods. @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ is the major species mainly related to neonatal infections. In this study, the two MDR @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ isolates belonged to ST4 and ST40. ST4 is a predominant sequence type in Cronobacter clinical isolates cultured from specimens of neonate and infant with symptoms of meningitis, @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This sequence type was also the predominant sequence type among Cronobacter isolates from PIF, while ST40 was commonly cultured from the environment, including multiple food processing facilities, and PIF, with only one isolate from a clinical case reported. Up to May 2022, the Cronobacter database of PubMLST had 3,424 sequences deposited, belonging to 94 STs, among which 425 sequences were from clinical isolates, with ST4 as the most predominant (27.1%; 115/425) sequence type. Regarding the 65 ST40 isolates in PubMLST, 19 (29.2%; 19/65) were from the environment and 4 (6.2%; 4/65) from clinical samples. Therefore, these two MDR @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ isolates would have the potential to cause clinical infections once infants consumed food contaminated by them.	1
According to the IDF (International @di$ Diabetes @/di$ Federation) @di$ Diabetes @/di$ Atlas (9th edition, 2019), ~463 million adults aged between 20 and 79 years have @di$ diabetes @/di$, and it will increase to 700 million by 2045. Among these, 374 million people will have the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes (https://www.idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-@di$ diabetes @/di$/facts-figures.html). There is a significant role of the gut microbiota in managing Type 2 diabetes. Previous reports suggested that members of the genera Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia reduced T2D, whereas, Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus, and @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ had a positive association with T2D. XOS derived from rice husk reduced insulin resistance and signaling and enhanced glucose uptake by altering the gut microbiota and mitigating endotoxemia. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) is known as the major glucose-transporting protein that promotes glucose uptake into the skeletal muscles and also controls glucose homeostasis in the body. XOS administration decreased the expression of GLUT-4 and transferred it from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane by Akt (protein kinase B) activation through phosphorylation. Prediabetic adults had a higher percentage of Howardella, Enterorhabdus, and Slackia populations in their stools. XOS treatment increased the abundance of positively associated microflora species such as @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$.	1
According to the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program for @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ (data collected from 45 nations including China between 1997 and 2016), the MIC90 of colistin for P. aeruginosa (7,107 isolates), A. baumannii or @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$ (3,124 isolates) and Enterobacteriaceae (54,476 isolates) was 2, 2, and >4 mg/L, respectively.	0
According to the results of IHC with the PAB antibody, granulomatous inflammation in @di$ sarcoidosis @/di$ patients may be caused by intracellular @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ proliferation at sites with latent infection (Figure 5). In @di$ sarcoid @/di$ lymph nodes, many PAB-reactive @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ are bound with immunoglobulins in sinus macrophages, whereas those in paracortical granuloma cells are mostly free from immunoglobulins. The difference between @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ with or without immunoglobulins suggests that @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$-derived insoluble immune complexes are formed extracellularly after intracellular proliferation and phagocytosed in sinus macrophages, some of which may escape local phagocytosis and spread via the lymphatic system and bloodstream.	1
Accumulating literature proves thatthere are close relationships between microorganisms and @di$ cardiovascular diseases @/di$. For example, bacteria from the mouth and intestine were found in atherosclerotic plaques, and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was correlated with lipid markers in patients with atherosclerosis.	1
Actin measurement based deriving the load of host cells which calculated to be (x-: 1.04E + 05, sigma: 2,33E + 05) in the @di$ peri-implantitis @/di$ samples and (x-: 4.86E + 04, sigma: 1,23E + 05) in the control specimen for positive sample. Methanogen DNA was detected in 19/28 (67%) control samples with an average number of cells of (x-: 1.42E + 04, sigma: 4.94E + 04) and in 17/30 (60%) in the @di$ peri-implantitis @/di$ sample with an average number of cells of (x-: 8.03E + 05, sigma: 2,53E + 06). The mean load ratio of @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ or M. massiliense in the @di$ peri-implantitis @/di$ samples was not significantly different than in the control samples (P = 0.48 and P = 0.4, respectively).	0
Acute pelvic irradiation of mice induced intestinal damage and inflammation, which resulted in loss of tight junctions, eventually leading to translocation of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes and @di$ dysbiosis @/di$. Radiation-induced @di$ dysbiosis @/di$ can aggravate intestinal inflammation, which was shown by an increased expression of IL-1beta. Members of the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Porhyromonadaceae families could be identified as markers of @di$ dysbiosis @/di$. Gamma irradiation of mice led to increased proportions of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, but reduced proportions of Barnesiella, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Oscillibacter, Pseudoflavonifractor and Mucispirillum in the large intestine. In the small intestine, irradiation led to an increase in Corynebacterium and decrease in @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$.	1
Acute- and convalescent-phase sera from 18 Thai patients and convalescent-phase sera from two Israeli patients and one Bangladeshi patient with Shigella dysenteriae 1 (Shiga) dysentery were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies that bind @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Shiga holotoxin, or two synthetic peptides representing epitopes from the B subunit of Shiga toxin. Paired sera from 24 Maryland adults with Shigella flexneri 2a or Shigella sonnei @di$ diarrhea @/di$ served as negative controls. Of the 16 paired Thai serum samples tested for immunoglobulin G LPS antibody, 10 had greater than or equal to 4-fold rises (the two subjects with the highest convalescent-phase titers exhibited toxin-neutralizing activity); acute-phase specimens from four of the remaining six individuals already had elevated Shiga LPS titers in their acute specimens ranging from 1:800 to 1:12,800. Similarly, convalescent-phase sera from the two Israeli patients and the Bangladeshi patient revealed LPS titers of 1:800 to 1:3,200. In contrast, none of the Maryland volunteers with S. flexneri or S. sonnei @di$ diarrhea @/di$ manifested rises in Shiga anti-LPS (P less than 0.00001 versus 10 of 16 Thai patients).	1
Additionally, @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ combined with rosuvastatin ameliorates imbalances in the intestinal microbiota, liver fibrosis, and liver functional defects in patients with NAFLD. Studies have also shown that Bifidobacterium longum infantis has health-promoting effects, such as reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration in intestinal epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells. One study effectively applied lactulose with or without rifaximin to prevent @di$ hepatic encephalopathy @/di$, which was verified by a multi-center randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.	2
Additionally, Kashar H with @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ was found to have good flavor whereas the other cheeses CM and C were found non-aromatic. On the next analysis day, cheese H was still identified as aromatic, but the numerical flavor scores of all samples tended to be closer to each other. On the other hand, storage time was an important factor in the flavor and texture of sample CM, while H and C remained more stable. According to the flavor scores, the flavor composition of CM_18 in Fig. 3 was less favored than the flavor compositions of the other products. However, in general, the flavor compounds given in Fig. 3 were appreciated by the panelists at their current concentrations during storage. Evaluation of the three samples revealed that their textures differed on day 40, but on day 72 the difference was no longer significant. During the storage period, the sandy texture was found in CM and C, while sample H with @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ was identified as typical, elastic fresh @di$ Kashar cheese @/di$.	0
Additionally, numerous studies have shown that @di$ non-alcoholic fatty liver disease @/di$ (@di$ NAFLD @/di$) is commonly observed in patients with T2DM. However, whether @di$ NAFLD @/di$ is a cause or consequence of the diabetic pathology remains a source of debate. Thus, this relationship is bidirectional, since T2DM substantially predicts the development of these metabolic disorders. Therefore, the @di$ NAFLD @/di$ status, hyperlipidemia and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism status were not collected to predict the risk of T2DM in the present study. : According to previous studies, 10 bacteria including Veillonellaceae, Clostridium leptum, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus and Eubacterium rectale were associated with T2DM. The abundance of Bacteroides was significantly lower in the T2DM group, which is consistent with a previous study in animals, which revealed that after administration of metformin, the relative abundance of Bacteroides was increased in mice and rats treated with metformin. @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ was more abundant in the control group in the present study, which is similar to a study which showed that the abundance of @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ was increased in patients after diabetic remission, achieved by both laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Interestingly, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ was significantly higher in both control female and male subgroups than in the T2DM female subgroup. Moreover, @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ was significantly higher in the control younger age subgroup than in the T2DM older age subgroup.	2
Additionally, several microorganisms were reported to be reduced in obese people such as Akkermansia muciniphila, @gm$ Anaerotruncus colihominis @/gm$, Butyrivibrio crossotus, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Alistipes, and Barnesiella. Furthermore, reduction of Oxalobacter formigenes species were linked to kidney stone formation. Another important example is the microbial dysbiosis that has been linked to several manifestations observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ patients.	0
Additionally, the abundances of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella species, Eikenella corrodens, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$, and Campylobacter rectus are increased in deep periodontal pockets and implicated as possible @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$.	1
Additionally, the increased presence of Bacteriodetes in FMT-treated piglets at 35 days of age may have also provided benefits to piglets; a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in healthy pigs after weaning compared with those that developed @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ has been observed. Additionally, control animals had a higher relative abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ at 24 days of age, which may explain the improvements in average daily gain observed at this age. Previous studies have documented @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ to have a positive correlation with body weight. However, by 35 days of age, no difference in average daily gain was observed between treatments, while @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ remained more abundant in control animals. Interestingly, the donor faeces contained large amounts of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, therefore the opposite would have been expected. Treponema, a potentially pathogenic bacteria which is associated with swine dysentery was present in higher amounts in control piglets at 35 days of age, which may have reduced the benefits of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$.	2
Additionally, this study demonstrated increased abundance of Bacteroides in general and @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ specifically in children with SpA. This organism has frequently been reported as abundant in pediatric @di$ arthritis @/di$, including) but not limited to SpA, while the opposite is observed in adults with SpA.	1
Additionally, we have found that SDD significantly decreases @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. abundance, despite the fact that colistin and tobramycin have no in vitro activity against @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. Some @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp. have immunomodulatory properties and play an important role in shaping the immune system and immune homeostasis. Previous studies have characterized the interspecies interaction between Gram-negative bacteria and streptococci. Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to promote streptococcal colonization in the airway of @di$ Cystic fibrosis @/di$ patients, and to promote streptococcal biofilm formation.	1
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy directed to the lungs, in particular for treatment of @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ (@di$ CF @/di$). In animal models of lung gene transfer, neutralizing antibodies in serum made in response to vector exposure have been associated with a partial to complete block to repeat transduction by vectors with the same capsid type, thus transduction by AAV vectors might be inefficient in humans previously exposed to the same AAV type. AAV type 2 (AAV2) has been used in clinical trials of lung gene transfer, but AAV5 and @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$ have been shown to mediate more efficient transduction in rodent lungs and in cultured human airway epithelia compared with that of AAV2. Here we have measured neutralizing antibodies against AAV type 2, 5, and 6 vectors in serum from children and adults with @di$ CF @/di$, and from normal adults. About 30% of adults were seropositive for AAV2, 20-30% were seropositive for AAV6, and 10-20% were seropositive for AAV5. @di$ CF @/di$ children were seropositive for AAV type 2, 5, or 6 at rates of 4-15%. All individuals seropositive for AAV6 were also seropositive for AAV2, and the AAV6 titer was low compared with the AAV2 titer. AAV5-positive sera were lower both in titers and rates than those seen for @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$. The results indicate that AAV type 2, 5 or 6 exposure is low in @di$ CF @/di$ and control populations and even lower in @di$ CF @/di$ children.	0
Administration of DFMs also has an important role in early life cattle; if @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$ is administered early in life, it can reduce the incidence of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (caused by E.	2
Administration of both polyphenols together prevented body @di$ weight gain @/di$ and reduced serum insulin levels. Moreover, individual supplementation of trans-resveratrol and quercetin effectively reduced serum insulin levels and insulin resistance. Quercetin supplementation generated a great impact on gut microbiota composition at different taxonomic levels, attenuating Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and inhibiting the growth of bacterial species previously associated to diet-induced obesity (Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacillus, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$).	2
Administration of myo-inositol is associated with positive impacts in term of cardiovascular risk factors and @di$ diabetes @/di$ incidence, notably through improvement of insulin sensitivity, in various pathological conditions such as childhood obesity, gestational diabetes, or polycystic ovary syndrome. Moreover, A. muciniphila was strongly positively correlated with myo-inositol in a depressive rat model exhibiting reduced intestinal amount of the bacterium. Notably, two bacteria (Dysosmobacter welbionis and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$) recently identified as potentially beneficial against obesity and @di$ diabetes @/di$ and also linked to higher thermogenesis, were shown to use myo-inositol to produce butyrate or propionate.	2
After 2-4 days, several colony of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pg, Actinobacillus @gm$ prevotella @/gm$, and the other Gram-negative bacteria would grow on that particular area. On the next step, the dominant pathogenic bacteria on the subgingival plaque, such as Pg, Treponema denticola, Tanerella forsythensis, Aa, F nucleatum, and Eikenella corodens, would grow on that plaque. This periodontal disease is an @di$ inflammation @/di$ reaction as a body blockade of bacterial invasion.	1
After 6-month therapy, the abundance of Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, and Escherichia was reduced, while the abundance of Bacteroides, Megasphaera, Roseburia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium was increased when compared with the CG group (Figure 2(b), P < 0.05). On the other hand, COS consumption increased the probiotic species Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Phascolarctobacterium. The results suggest that COS consumption can inhibit the abundance of harmful bacteria and increase the abundance or species of probiotics in @di$ CHD @/di$ patients.	2
After 6-month therapy, the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, and Escherichia was reduced, while the abundance of Bacteroides, @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, Roseburia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium was increased when compared with the CG group (Figure 2(b), P < 0.05). On the other hand, COS consumption increased the probiotic species Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Phascolarctobacterium. The results suggest that COS consumption can inhibit the abundance of harmful bacteria and increase the abundance or species of probiotics in @di$ CHD @/di$ patients.	2
After @di$ weight loss @/di$, reduction of albuminuria/proteinuria is almost consistently seen; small studies documented retardation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss after bariatric surgery; reduction of blood pressure (BP) is less consistent. It has been known for a long time that the frequency of oxalate stones is increased after bariatric surgery. The main renal threat of hyperoxaluria is renal oxalosis, often irreversible, causing persisting renal failure. The causes are reduced oxalate binding by calcium due to saponification of calcium causing fat malabsorption, increased permeability for oxalate because of increased permeability of colon mucosa triggered by increased bile salts and reduced colonization of the colon by @gm$ oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$.	1
After adjusting for covariates (age, sex, BMI), high PA patients had differences in the beta diversity compared to low PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ patients and healthy volunteers, indicating compositional differences in their microbiota (Fig. 1b). Additionally, high PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ patients had lower alpha diversity, indicating decreased species richness and evenness compared to low PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ and healthy volunteers (Fig. 1c). No major taxonomy shifts were observed at higher phylogenetic levels (phylum and class) with one family different from high PA in both healthy and low PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$: Rikenellaceae (Fig. 1d, extended fig. 1a). However, between all three groups, 14 unique bacterial species were found to be differentially abundant (q<0.1, Fig. 1e, colored red). Eleven taxa correlated with low PA status, with the top three species being @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$, Rumincoccus bromii, and Subdoligranulum (Fig 1f; correlation plots for additional differentially abundant taxa with q<0.1 are shown in extended fig. 1, b and c). When only high PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ and healthy samples were compared, 9 differentially abundant taxa were identified, of which 3 were in higher abundance in healthy individuals (Fig. 1g). Interestingly, @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ was universally absent in high PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ patients but comprises ~5.0% of the proportional gut taxa in healthy volunteers. @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ was also the only taxa that differentiated the high and low PA PI-@di$ IBS @/di$ groups. A random forest machine learning algorithm with Boruta features identified six bacteria as important predictors of PA status: @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$, Bacteroides ovatus, Collinsella aerofaciens, Clostridium bolteae, Dorea formicigenerans and Ruminococcus obeum (Fig.	2
After excluding species with relative abundances of less than 0.01%, the HCC, @di$ LC @/di$, and NC groups contained 2, 9, and 30 species, respectively ( Figure 3 ). Odoribacter splanchnicus and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$ were species-level potential biomarkers for the detection of HCC.	0
After the administration of @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains, the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased significantly (P < 0.05), i.e., 4-21-fold and 1-37-fold, respectively, compared with those in the negative control group. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are considered to be important intestinal beneficial microorganisms that can regulate gastrointestinal function and enhance human immunity. A significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroides was also observed following treatment with the four @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains, with a 24.13-89.34% decrease compared with the negative control group. The authors of another study reported that Bacteroides inhabited the human intestines and might cause endogenous infections when the body's immune function was disrupted or the flora was unbalanced due to the use of antibiotics. The relative abundances of Blautia and several genera from Erysipelotrichaceae and Lachnospiraceae further decreased when the @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ strains were administered. Enterobacteriaceae contains a variety of intestinal pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella, which are closely associated with intestinal diseases (including @di$ bacterial diarrhea @/di$, gastroenteritis, and dysentery).	2
After transplantation, @di$ diarrhea @/di$ may be caused by infectious agents, drug-specific effects, metabolic conditions, or mechanical complications of surgery. Determining the cause helps to determine whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy and the duration of treatment. In this study we aimed to determine the causes of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in kidney or liver recipients. Fifty-two @di$ diarrhea @/di$ episodes among 43 solid organ recipients were evaluated. The cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ was detected in 43 patients (82.6%). Infectious etiologies accounted for 33 out of the 43 episodes (76.7%) in which a specific cause was determined: Giardia lamblia in 9, Cryptosporidium parvum in 7, cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 6, Clostridium difficile in 3, Campylobacter jejuni in 2, Shigella sonnei in 2, @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ in 1, rotavirus in 1, Entamoeba histolytica in 1, and Blastocystis hominis in 1. Non-infectious etiologies were found for 10 episodes (23.3%): mycophenolate mofetil-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in 5, antibiotic-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in 2, colchicine-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in 2, and laxative drug-associated in 1. Non-infectious etiologies seem to be relatively common causes of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ among transplant recipients. Therapy was adjusted in 5 patients because of mycophenolate mofetil-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$. CMV and C. parvum, which are seldom seen in the normal population, were frequent causes of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in this group. Evaluating the transplant recipients for non-infectious causes of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ is important in prompt diagnosis and treatment.	1
All @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ serogroups can cause gastrointestinal infections after an incubation period of 12-50 h, after which time individuals experience watery diarrhea in conjunction with fever, fatigue, malaise, and abdominal cramps (Table 1). Although dysentery can be caused by all four @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ serogroups, S. dysenteriae type 1 is the most frequent cause of epidemic dysentery and is associated with a particularly severe form of the illness that may be accompanied by other complications including @di$ HUS @/di$.	1
All four types of Shigella can cause shigellosis, but @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ is the most common bacterial preparation used for shigellosis. The traditional hosts of this pathogen are limited to primates; however, the range of hosts has been extended to many animals in recent decades. The symptoms of shigellosis in humans include diarrhea (100 %), headache (100 %), @di$ fever @/di$ (100 %), nausea (99 %), abdominal cramping (97 %), vomiting (95 %), and bloody stools (51 %); however, the symptoms in animals are unclear.	1
All mice showed @di$ weight loss @/di$ and hematochezia, and several had diarrhea after the DSS treatment. According to the weight curve, DSS treatment led to a peak decrease in body weight on days 10 and 11, followed by a gradual return to baseline levels. After 2 weeks of @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ administration, no significant difference was observed between control and @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$-treated mice in the treated group. In the pretreated group, from days 31 to 34, the DSS-induced decrease in body weight was significantly less in mice treated with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ compared with the control groups (Figure 2A, 2B). Clinical symptoms were also assessed using CAS. Compared with the control groups, the mice treated with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ showed better-formed stools with less evident blood in both the treated and the pretreated groups. After exposure to DSS, the CAS curve notably increased on day 4 and then gradually decreased on day 9 after reaching its peak. After treatment with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$, the CASs for mice in both the treated and the pretreated groups were significantly decreased compared with the values for the control mice with colitis (P<0.05). Particularly, mice pretreated with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ exhibited a more significant decrease in CAS compared with the control group (P=0.000) (Figure 2C, 2D).	2
"All possible combinations for the searches included one of the following keywords related to @di$ IBD @/di$: ""@gm$ Fusobacterium @/gm$,"" ""Faecalibacterium,"" ""Escherichia coli,"" or ""Crohn's disease.""."	0
Also, Akkermansia bacteria (Verrucomicrobia, Verrucomicrobiae, Verrucomicrobiales, Akkermansiaceae, and Akkermansia) were significantly associated with @di$ TG @/di$ (r = -0.266). Additionally, Bifidobacterium_adolescentis bacteria (Actinomycetia, Bifidobacteriales, Bifidobacteriaceae, and Bifidobacterium) were significantly associated with TG (r = 0.424), Chol (r = 0.363), and LDL-C (r = 0.372). Moreover, taxonomic composition of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the Clostridia and Bacteroidia, showed a significant association with glucose and lipid metabolism. Specifically, Coprococcus comes bacteria (Clostridia, Eubacteriales, Lachnospiraceae, and Coprococcus) were significantly associated with Glu (r = -0.472); Roseburia_inulinivorans and Roseburia_intestinalis bacteria (Clostridia, Eubacteriales, Lachnospiraceae, and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$) were significantly associated with body fat percentage (r = 0.277), HB (r = -0.297), and HbA1c (r = -0.302); and Parabacteroides_merdae bacteria (Bacteroidia, Bacteroidales, Tannerellaceae, and Parabacteroides) were significantly associated with HB (r = -0.231), HbA1c (r = -0.267).	2
Although @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ constitutes a proportion of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal and genital tracts, and the oral cavity, it has been reported that S. anginosus infection could be closely associated with @di$ abscesses @/di$ at various body sites, infective endocarditis, and upper gastrointestinal cancers. The colonization in an acidic environment due to the aciduricity of @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ could be the etiology of the systemic infection of the bacteria. To elucidate the aciduricity and acid tolerance mechanisms of the microbe, we examined the viability and growth of @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ under acidic conditions. The viabilities of S. anginosus NCTC 10713 and Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 at pH 4.0 showed as being markedly higher than those of Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 49456; however, the viability was partially inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an H+-ATPase inhibitor, suggesting that H+-ATPase could play a role in the viability of @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ under acidic conditions. In addition, S. anginosus NCTC 10713 could grow at pH 5.0 and showed a marked arginine deiminase (ADI) activity, unlike its DeltaarcA mutant, deficient in the gene encoding ADI, and other streptococcal species, which indicated that ADI could also be associated with aciduricity. These results suggest that @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ has significant aciduric properties, which can be attributed to these enzyme activities.	1
Although anaerobic @di$ bacteremias @/di$ are uncommon in oncohematologic patients, nevertheless they have been considered an emergent problem in the last few years. @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus commonly present in the oral cavity and in the respiratory and genito-urinary tracts. Over a 10-year period 18 episodes of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ @di$ bacteremia @/di$ in patients with hematological malignances (15 leukemias and 3 lymphomas) have been observed in our Department of Hematology. Predisposing factors included oropharyngeal mucositis and severe neutropenia owing to intensive chemotherapy. In our experience no septic shock occurred and the outcome of @di$ bacteremias @/di$ caused by @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ was favorable.	1
Although approximately 700 bacterial species exist in the oral cavity, only a small subset, referred to as periodontal bacteria, possess the capability to cause periodontal inflammation and subsequent @di$ bone and tissue damage @/di$. Among all of the periodontal bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythia) and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ (@gm$ T. denticola @/gm$) are known as the 'red complexes' and are particularly pathogenic.	1
Although booster doses can enhance antibody production and reduce the severity of @di$ infection @/di$ outcomes, we showed that antibiotics were still associated with 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold higher risks of hospitalization and severe clinical outcomes (including ICU admission, ventilatory support, and death), respectively, in the three-dose vaccine recipients. Bacterial co-infection causes life-threatening complications in patients with severe viral infections, including COVID-19. Studies show that early antibiotic exposure poses risks for childhood asthma, allergies, and airway illnesses. Indiscriminate administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase nosocomial bloodstream infection rates in immunocompromised cancer patients. While the baseline composition of the gut microbiota is mostly restored within 1.5 months, several common species (e.g., Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Coprococcus eutactus, Coliinsella aerofaciens, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bididobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium angulatum, and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$) remain undetectable for at least 180 days. With the combination of the immunocompromising effects of the viral infection and the antibiotic-driven depletion of commensal gut microbes, it has been proven that microorganisms from the dysbiotic gut microbiome translocate into the blood of COVID-19 patients, leading to dangerous blood-streamed @di$ infection @/di$ during COVID-19.	1
Although cases of drug resistance to @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ are on the increase, there has been no change in mortality rates. The fact that the medical literature shows no proven correlation between drug-resistant S pneumoniae and clinical failure suggests that concerns about drug resistance in S pneumoniae may be overstated. Therefore, in treating community-acquired @di$ pneumonia @/di$, physicians should also weigh other important considerations such as pharmacology, safety, tolerability, and dosing convenience.	0
Although clinical and laboratory findings were unremarkable at presentation, she rapidly developed septic syndrome with @di$ disseminated intravascular coagulation @/di$ and eventually multiple organ failure. The fetus was disintegrated and the uterus had to be removed. She was discharged from the intensive care unit after 34 days. Cultures of the uterine content grew @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$.	1
Although comprising less than 0.01% of the normal human gastrointestinal microbiota, @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ is the third most common anaerobe recovered from clinical material obtained from patients with perforated and gangrenous appendicitis. Since its discovery in 1988, @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ has been recovered from clinical specimens associated with a variety of infections, including sepsis, @di$ liver abscesses @/di$, cholecystitis, Fournier's gangrene, soft tissue abscesses, empyema, osteomyelitis, Bartholinitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.	1
Although fecal culture was positive for @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ only in 22 of these 50 patients, in southern India, severely dehydrating acute @di$ infective diarrhea @/di$ in adults is almost always due to cholera. Such @di$ diarrhea @/di$ may also be caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli that elaborate heat labile enterotoxin and produce a syndrome similar to cholera. Standard bacterial cultures did not reveal the presence of any other bacterial enteropathogens in these patients, nor were parasites noted in any of the patients; however we did not test for enterotoxigenic E. coli. When sub-group analysis was done on those patients with positive stool cultures for @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$, the difference between the two treatment groups remained statistically highly significant. In an earlier study, our group demonstrated that addition of HAMS to conventional (iso-osmolar) glucose ORS reduced @di$ diarrhea @/di$ duration and fecal weight in patients with cholera. Children with non-cholera diarrhea possibly represent a different group by virtue of the different spectrum of pathogens that cause @di$ diarrhea @/di$. The ability of colonically-absorbed carbohydrate to shorten @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in children has been examined with variable results. HAMS and partially hydrolysed guar gum both shortened @di$ diarrhea @/di$ compared to conventional iso-osmolar glucose ORS. However, a mixture of colonically-absorbed carbohydrates did not shorten @di$ diarrhea @/di$ when compared to reduced osmolarity glucose ORS. The latter finding can be ascribed either to the small amount of colonically-absorbed carbohydrate that was added or to the comparison with a reduced osmolarity ORS which may already have maximally increased absorption. The present study is different in that it examined the possibility that HAMS could reduce @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in adult patients with cholera treated with a low sodium hypo-osmolar ORS.	1
Although rats do not vomit, they exhibit pica behavior (eating of nonnutritive substances such as kaolin) in response to a variety of emetogenic stimuli, which can be used as a proxy variable for @di$ nausea @/di$ and vomiting in rat models. In this study, we administered a probiotic mixture (Bifidobacterium brevis DM8310, Lactobacillus acidophilus DM8302, Lactobacillus casei DM8121, and @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$ DM8309) to rats with cisplatin-induced mucosal damage and pica.	2
Although severe dysentery and extra-intestinal manifestations - including @di$ hemolytic-uremic syndrome @/di$ (@di$ HUS @/di$), leukocytosis and intestinal obstruction - are thought to be more frequent with @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 infection as a consequence of its toxin production, the relative frequency of other complications - such as convulsions, hypoglycemia, and sepsis - is either unknown or thought to be more frequent in species of Shigella other than @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1.	1
Although the above studies support the role of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ as an intestinal pathogen, the isolation of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ from healthy individuals, and the failure of some studies to show a significant difference in the prevalence of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in subjects with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ and healthy controls, has raised contention as to the role of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in intestinal disease. While these latter findings would to some degree argue against the role of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ in gastroenteritis, the fact that great sequence diversity exists within @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains raises the possibility that differences may exist in their pathogenic potential. To further examine the importance of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ heterogeneity with respect to disease potential, we sequenced the genomes of six new @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains and performed comparative analyses of these and two known strains, which allowed us to compare strains isolated from three CD, one chronic gastroenteritis, three acute gastroenteritis patients as well as one from a healthy control.	0
Although the beta diversity was not different in our study, several Clostridiales sp., such as @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, R. torques and D. formicigenerans, were more abundant in dystonia patients than in the healthy controls. In our cohort, many species belonging to the Bacteriodetes phylum were less abundant as well, except for P. copri, which was more abundant in the whole dystonia group and in the MD and @di$ DRD @/di$ cohorts.	1

Surprisingly, in other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and @di$ depression @/di$, the Prevotellaceae family was less abundant.	0
Although the incidence of bacterial meningitis has declined in Western countries following the introduction of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ , and Neisseria meningitidis , the incidence rate is much higher in developing regions of the world such as Africa.  The recognized risk factors for pneumococcal meningitis include group B Streptococcus -positive mothers, immunodeficiency, absence of opsonic bactericidal antibody, basilar @di$ skull fracture @/di$, prematurity, low birth weight, young age, living in a dormitory, lack of immunization, ear/nose/throat infections, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, cochlear implants, and neurosurgery.	1
Although typically a commensal of the human GI tract, enterococci are often associated with a variety of clinical infections including @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$, hepatobiliary sepsis, endocarditis, surgical wound infections, bacteraemia and neonatal sepsis. Enterococcus faecalis and @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ are the two species responsible for the majority of healthcare-associated enterococcal infections.	1
Altogether, the data here reported indicate that methanogens including @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ and M. smithii are common inhabitants of the oral cavity, independently of the presence of any pathology. Accordingly methanogens including @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ and M. smithii are potentially exchangeable between individuals through various occasions of oral fluid direct and indirect exchanges, since oral fluid is one person-to-person exchangeable fluid which may occur during mother-to-child contacts, cross-exchanges of food and fomites, and kissing. During such contacts, living methanogens could be then exchanged and possibly implanted in the receiver's microbiota. This is not without significance since methanogens have been implicated in some diseases of the oral cavity such as periodontitis and peri-implantits of the digestive tract including @di$ obesity @/di$, anorexia and chronic constipation and were convincingly associated with vaginosis.	1

Among bacteria, significant examples include the association of Helicobacter pylori and gastric adenocarcinoma or @di$ mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma @/di$, Streptococcus bovis and colon cancer, Chlamydia pneumoniae and lung cancer, @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ and colorectal cancer, or Prevotella melaninogenica and oral cancer.	1
Among the 11 enriched species, 7 were reported as @di$ CRC @/di$- or cancers-associated bacteria (Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Villanelle dispar, @gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$, Prevotella fusca, Prevotella dentalis, and Prevotella denticola). While 5 were reported as protective bacteria (Blautia sp SC05B48, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lachnospiraceae bacterium Choco86, Enterococcus hirae, Blautia sp YL58) among the 14 depleted species (Fig. 3A and Figs. S5, S6). In particular, the top two enriched bacteria in appendectomy subjects, B. vulgatus and B. fragilis, were found to have age-specific correlation, in which they were significantly enriched only in the older subgroup (both P < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The top two depleted bacteria in appendectomy, B. sp SC05B48 and C. aerofaciens, also showed age-specific correlation with significant depletion in the younger subgroup (both P < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). Such changes in bacterial abundances (B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. sp SC05B48 and C. aerofaciens) were sustained for over 2 years after appendectomy (Fig. S7A). Moreover, the virulence factor gene pks was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in appendectomy cohort compared to normal controls (Fig. S7B). To further validate the abundance of differentially enriched bacteria identified by our metagenomic analyses, we performed qPCR of 3 representative enriched (B.fragilis, B. vulgatus, V. dispar) and depleted bacteria (E. hirae, Lachnospiraceae bacterium Choco86, Blautia sp. SC05B48) in appendectomy cases. The results showed a consistent distribution of differential enriched bacterial species as metagenomic analyses (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8). Collectively, these observations consistently indicated that alterations in gut microbiome after appendectomy could be pathogenic with enrichments of several @di$ CRC @/di$-associated bacteria and depletion of beneficial commensals.	1
Among the 200bacterial species isolated from dental plaque the most pathogenic for @di$ dental caries @/di$ are: Streptococcus mutans (serotypes C, E and F), Streptococcus sobrinus (serotype C and G), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomices viscusus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$.	1
Among the case-associated microbes shared by CD and UC, recognizable microbes such as @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$, and known commensal species like Morganella morganii (Figure 3b, 3e), are potentially involved in @di$ gut dysbiosis @/di$.	1
Among the food pathogens, @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ is a facultative anaerobic, gram-negative human pathogen. It causes pandemic/endemic cholera, cholera-like @di$ diarrhoea @/di$, and extra-intestinal infections. Consumption of contaminated water and/or food are the major causes of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ infections and reports reveal that around 1.3 to 4.0 million people get infected by them every year all over the world. In inter-epidemic periods, @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ can survive long in their natural habitats by virtue of their ability to form biofilm and hence, they could be potential threats in causing widespread infection in near future by evolving as an epidemic clone. Continued researches on emerging strains of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ have demonstrated a high frequency of emergence of multidrug-resistant strains.	1
Among the patients with @di$ bacterial infections @/di$, pathogen detection succeeded in 18 (2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus intermedius, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Hemophilus influenzae, 1 Clostridium difficile, 1 Campylobacter jejuni, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ 1 Streptococcus gallolyticus, 1 Bartonella quintana).	1
Among the typical bacterial groups in mice fed BW, besides lactic acid bacteria, Clostridia_UCG-014 and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ are associated with beneficial properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effects. T. sanguinis might be important for host lipid and steroid metabolism. An increase in the abundance of @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Enterohabdas with plant proteins, such as beta-conglycinin of soybeans, has been reported.	2
Among them, five species belong to Lactobacillus, while species of the same family have been recently reported to alleviate @di$ depression @/di$-related symptoms in a CUMS mouse model by regulating brain xanthine oxidase activity. To identify distinguishable microbial characteristics between 4-week CUMS and 8-week CUMS treatments, LEfSe analysis revealed the differential OTUs between the two groups ( Figures 4A, B ). The long-term depression group was characterized by disturbance of Alistipes indistinctus, Bacteroides ovatus, and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ at the species level ( Figure 4B ). @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, primarily isolated from medical clinical samples, is a relatively new genus that is highly relevant in dysbiosis and disease, including mental signs of @di$ depression @/di$.	1

Among these significant correlations, age and FBG showed none correlation with glycan biosynthesis-related bacteria or orthologs, while @di$ TG @/di$ only positively correlated with one glycan-generating bacteria (B. vulgatus), and HDL only negatively correlated with the same bacteria, so these factors should have little influence on at least glycan-biosynthesis bacteria and functions of gut microbiome in HBP patients. Still, there was no body mass index (BMI) information in the HBP group, making us unable to analyze the correlation of BMI and the identified metagenomic changes. But according to meta-analysis on obesity adults' gut microbiota, the obesity adults had enriched Blautia hydrogenotrophica, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum; while lean adults had higher abundance of Bacteroides faecichinchillae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium bolteae, and Flavonifractor plautii.	0
An 18-year-old man with @di$ infective endocarditis @/di$ caused by @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$ is reported. This bacterial species has long been of interest in veterinary medicine, and recently it has been reported to be one cause of infantile diarrhea. @di$ Infective endocarditis @/di$ arising from @gm$ campylobacter fetus @/gm$ is rare. This is the fourth case reported in Japan. The organism was resistant to several antibiotics, and large vegetations were found to involve the aortic valve. Emergency excision of the infected aortic valve and replacement with a valve prosthesis were successful. Current clinical treatment of @di$ infective endocarditis @/di$ is discussed, and the literature briefly reviewed.	1
An 86-year-old woman developed large bullae on both legs during the course of septicemia due to @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$. Although erysipelas-like lesions and erythema nodosum have been known to be associated with Yersinia infections, this is the first reported case with @di$ multiple bullae @/di$.	1
An IHF-like protein has been purified from a @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ strain isolated from a @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ patient, by the rapid purification method described for the isolation of IHF from Rhodobacter capsulatus. The IHF of @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ is an alpha beta heterodimer (subunits of 10 and 11 kDa) similar to IHF from Escherichia coli and from R. capsulatus; the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the isolated subunits share a high degree of identity with their homologs from E. coli. @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ IHF is able to bind to the promoter of the hydrogenase structural genes (hupSL) of R. capsulatus as do the other two IHF proteins. It is also demonstrated by gel retardation assays that @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ IHF forms a stable complex with the algD promoter in vitro, an indication that the protein is involved in the regulation of algD gene expression in @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$.	1
An important hallmark of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ expressing Cnm protein is its binding activity to components of vascular BM, such as collagen-IV and laminin. Collagen-binding activity is positively correlated with cnm mRNA expression in @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$. Conversely, neither cnm-negative @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ nor cnm knockout strains of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ can attach to soft tissues such as vessel walls. Aging and @di$ hypertension @/di$ induce endothelial injury and BM thickening, resulting in collagen-IV and laminin exposure in cerebral small arteries. Once cnm-positive @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ adheres to BM, infiltration of neutrophils may activate local inflammation, increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, and production of enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinase-9, inducing ICH or CMB (Figure). Endothelial injury related to aging and @di$ hypertension @/di$ is prominent in the deep cerebral vessels, likely contributing to an increase in the deep CMB rather than lobar CMB, by cnm-positive @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$.	1
An in vivo study on SKH-1 hairless mice aimed to test a probiotic mixture of five bacterial strains, Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, in preserving skin integrity and homeostasis. It has been observed that daily oral treatment with the probiotic mixture, through modulation of the immune response, has significantly limited chronic skin inflammation, demonstrating its use in pathological dermatological conditions such as @di$ AD @/di$ and psoriasis.	2
An increase in the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is a sign of aging in cynomolgus monkeys. Reducing the relative abundance of Alistipes and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ could be an anti-aging approach. In our present study, Alistipes (e.g., A. shahii, A. dispar, and A. communis) and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ were found to be enriched in the HG. The relative abundances of Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Streptococcus macedonicus, which are probiotics for anti-aging, were relatively lower in HG voles. Gut microbiota may compensate for or support the aging process of the body through positive stimulation. Both LG and MG had more abundant bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, thereby reducing @di$ inflammation @/di$ and maintaining the stability of gut microbiota. For example, Blautia and Eubacterium can produce acetic acid and butyric acid. Notably, in the assay of fecal short-chain fatty acids, we also found significantly higher concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in the feces of the LG than in the feces of the HG. Butyric acid is beneficial for anti-aging. Aging is often associated with a reduction in the abundance of Akkermansia and butyric acid-producing bacteria, and damage to the gut integrity. Our results suggest that this specific anti-aging or anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ or probiotic bacterial species might play an important role in regulating density-dependent aging processes of voles.	2
An interesting recent trial demonstrated that a two-week pre-treatment with @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ (1 x 109 CFU) in mice had neuroprotective effects against ischaemia/@di$ reperfusion injury @/di$; in fact, neurologic deficit scores, which were higher in ischaemia/reperfusion mice compared to sham mice (p < 0.01), significantly decreased in treated mice (mean scores 3.5 vs.	2
An isolated myocardial abscess due to @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ developed in the scar of a @di$ myocardial infarction @/di$. Fever, chills and signs of pericarditis were the main clinical features. Mild enteritis 1 week prior to the onset of symptoms related to the abscess was the most likely cause of the bacteremia. The diagnosis was established at thoracotomy, performed because of cardiac tamponade. Thirteen other cases of isolated bacterial myocardial abscess accompanying @di$ myocardial infarction @/di$ have been reported, but all the infarctions were recent.	1
Anaerobic equol-producing bacteria such as Slackia isoflavoniconvertens, @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$, and Lactococcus garvieae can convert daidzein (or genistein) into (S)-equol (or (-)-5-hydroxyequol) in the human intestine with a strict enantioselective manner. When such gut bacterial metabolites reach their biological target organs or tissues, they function as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) based on their selective binding affinity for ERbeta over ERalpha. The functional phytoestrogen (S)-equol has been clinically verified to be effective against estrogen or testosterone-related health problems including women's menopausal symptoms, ovarian/prostate cancers, @di$ osteoporosis @/di$, and even hair loss.	2

Anaerobic species have increasingly become the subject of research with the discovery that they are abundant in the @di$ CF @/di$ lung microbiome and may influence other members of the microbial community. For example, Sherrard et al. showed that Prevotella spp. can secrete extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, hereby protecting P. aeruginosa from the antimicrobial action of ceftazidime. Additionally, Luppens et al. found that in a dual-species biofilm of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ with Streptococcus mutans the latter showed increased survival after various antimicrobial treatments (amine chloride, zinc chloride, erythromycin, or hydrogen peroxide). In the context of dental plaque co-cultivation of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ spp.	0
Analysis of flora differences between SFRA and SFOA samples revealed that Veillonella dispar, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella copri, Fusobacterium, and Treponema amylovorum are more abundant in SFRA samples, while @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ is concentrated in SFOA samples. Among them, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella copri and @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ have been previously shown to be present in feces of mouse models for @di$ arthritis @/di$. Our results show that these bacterial DNA are also present in ST or SF. Therefore, intestinal bacteria or oral bacteria may enter and settle into joint cavities through certain pathways and then become involved in the occurrence and development of @di$ arthritis @/di$.	1
Analysis of molecular sequence databases (Genbank and SwissProt) shows that three bacteria (@gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$,Ruminococcus albus, and Agrobacter tumefaciens) share sequences with the encephalitogenic peptide of bovine myelin, while three molecules in Escherichia coli show molecular mimicry with host-encoded prion protein. Immune responses against these bacteria at both T and B cell levels may cause @di$ neurological tissue injury @/di$ resembling BSE.	1
Analysis of the bacterial community at the species level found that the proportions of Bacteroides ovatus, an anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria from the Bacteroides genus commonly found in the gut was markedly increased in normal-weight children but depleted in @di$ overweight @/di$ children after the probiotics intervention. This is in agreement with other similar studies that reported an increase in bacterial species from the phylum Bacteroidetes in lean individuals. There was an increase in the bacterial species such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides faecichinchillae from Bacteroides phylum and Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium bolteae, and Flavonifractor plautii species from the Firmicutes phylum among lean individuals. On the other hand, obese individuals had a larger composition on bacterial species belonging to the Firmicutes phylum such as Blautia hydrogenotorophica, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus bromii, and @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$.	1
Analysis of the subgingival microflora has recently implicated Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans and several black @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species in the aetiology of juvenile, adult and rapidly progressing @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Rapid bacteriological diagnosis has been hampered by the slow growth and fastidious nature of these bacteria. To construct diagnostic probes, dideoxy sequencing of the 16S rRNA molecules from A. (H.) actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius subgroup II, @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$ and several closely related species was performed.	1
Annotation uncovered 114 strain-specific ORFs in the @di$ CF @/di$ isolate 491 (see Additional file 10). Most ORFs to which a function could be ascribed encode enzymes of DNA metabolism or mobility or elements of conjugation and type IV secretion. The closest ortholog or homolog was identified for all ORFs in beta- or gamma-proteobacteria that have been classified in the pre-16S rDNA taxonomic era as 'honorary pseudomonads' because they share lifestyle, habitat and metabolic versatility with the 'class I' pseudomonads P. aeruginosa, @gm$ P. putida @/gm$, P.	0
Another important point of our findings includes the cross-reactivity of antibodies against MPT64, LAM, and PAB to @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$. It has been reported that MPT64 and LAM are specific to M. tuberculosis, and PAB is solely expressed on Propionibacterium (Cutibacterium) acnes. The P. acnes antigens were detected in granulomas of @di$ sarcoidosis @/di$.	0
Another possible mechanism involves bacteria-derived @di$ amyloids @/di$, produced by E. coli, Salmonella spp., @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolorcan, that can function as initiators to cross-seed and through molecular mimicry aggregate host @di$ amyloids @/di$. In addition, a chronic H. pylori infection could trigger the release of both inflammatory mediators and @di$ amyloids @/di$ in AD patients, while the eradication of H.	1

Antigen I/II Modulates the Interactions of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ Serotype 9 With Dendritic Cells: Role in Phagocytosis Resistance, Intracellular Survival, and Pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ Mediator Induction.	1
Approximately 40%-80% of patients with CaOx stones have concomitant @di$ UTIs @/di$, which are generally considered to be secondary to CaOx stones rather than a causative factor for its formation. Our study indicated that @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ is the most common bacterial species detected both in CaOx stone former's urine and stone. Additionally, @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ isolated from urine and stones in the same CaOx patient had similar characteristics, like consistent antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, genotyping, phylogenetic groups, virulence, and resistance genes. Instead of the dead bacteria or their fragments, only living and intact @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ bacteria promote nucleation and aggregation of CaOx crystals. An in vivo study has confirmed that injection of @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ into the urinary tract of mice causes renal inflammation and promotes crystal deposition. Nevertheless, none of these studies have explored the key factors and specific mechanisms by which @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ promotes CaOx calculus formation, in greater detail. Intriguingly, we confirmed that even in the absence of @gm$ E. coli @/gm$, the culture medium of wild-type @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ promotes the aggregation of CaOx crystals, indicating that some regulatory molecules secreted by @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ may be the key factors leading to CaOx crystal aggregation in vitro.	1
Approximately two thirds of patients complaining of fever and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in early 1950 had bacillary dysentery, and Shigella flexneri was the causative pathogen in more than 95% of the cases. In 1952-1953, S. flexneri was the most common strain accounting for 90.9% of the 3,732 Shigella isolates obtained from soldiers, refugees and prisoners while there were relatively fewer cases of isolation of @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ (6.3%), Shigella sonnei (2.3%) and Shigella boydii (0.5%).	1
Arabinan polymers are major components of the cell wall in @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ and are involved in maintaining its structure, as well as playing a role in host-pathogen interactions. In particular, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) has multiple immunomodulatory effects. In the nonpathogenic species Mycobacterium smegmatis, EmbC has been identified as a key arabinosyltransferase involved in the incorporation of arabinose into LAM, and an embC mutant is viable but lacks LAM. In contrast, we demonstrate here that in @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$, embC is an essential gene under normal growth conditions, suggesting a more crucial role for LAM in the pathogenic mycobacteria. @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ EmbC has an activity similar to that of M. smegmatis EmbC, since we were able to complement an embC mutant of M. smegmatis with embC(Mtb), confirming that it encodes a functional arabinosyltransferase. In addition, we observed that the size of LAM produced in M. smegmatis was dependent on the level of expression of embC(Mtb). Northern analysis revealed that embC is expressed as part of a polycistronic message encompassing embC and three upstream genes. The promoter region for this transcript was identified and found to be up-regulated in stationary phase but down-regulated during @di$ hypoxia @/di$-induced nonreplicating persistence. In conclusion, we have identified one of the key genes involved in LAM biosynthesis in @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ and confirmed its essential role in this species.	1
Archaea (Methanobrevibacter smithii/@gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$) were associated with healthy donors (detected in 65% (M. smithii)/22% (@gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$) of samples) and C. difficile negative samples (52%/21% for formed stool and 51%/19% for @di$ diarrhoea @/di$). C. difficile positive samples (especially those colonized with non - 027 ribotype) were characterised by lower frequencies of archaea. Frequencies of M. smithii/@gm$ M. stadtmanae @/gm$ in 027 positive C. difficile samples were (38%/19% for formed stool and 32%/17% for @di$ diarrhoea @/di$) and in non - 027 positive samples (29%/12% for formed stool and 26%/10% for @di$ diarrhoea @/di$).	2
Arterial @di$ hypertension @/di$ is correlated with increased levels of A. naeslandii (R = 0.252; p = 0.025) and F. prausnitzii (R = 0.238; p = 0.035), while diabetes mellitus type II rises the levels of Ruminococcus spp. (R = 0.354; p = 0.001), R. trehalosifermentans (R = 0.346; p = 0.002), @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ (R = 0.276; p = 0.014) and Sutterella wadswortemis (R = 0.327; p = 0.003). Cancer also influences concentrations of A. naeslandii (R = 0.222; p = 0.049) and R. litaburensis (R = 0.270; p = 0.016). Chronic medication change microbiota composition as well, essentially anti-@di$ hypertensives @/di$, that increase levels of Coprococcus spp. (R = 0.294; p = 0.009), A. naeslandii (R = 0.227; p = 0.044) and @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ (R = 0.229; p = 0.043), gastric protectors, that augments the concentration of S.	1
Arthritic and histologically normal joints from swine in which @di$ arthritis @/di$ had been produced by the intravenous inoculation of @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ were used as a source of fluids for lysosomal enzyme determinations.	1
As GEMS was a case-control study, the dataset comprised Shigella case isolates derived from patients with @di$ MSD @/di$ and control isolates from children without diarrhoea (see Methods). To explore the utility of vaccination targeting genomic subtype (relative to targeting serotype) for @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$, we determined the relative effect size of the dominant subtype on the epidemiological outcome of shigellosis (that is, isolates derived from case patients rather than from controls). The dominant genomic subtype was PG3, which comprised the majority (47%, 378/806) of total isolates, as well as case (50%, 341/687) isolates, with some regional variation (Fig. 2). This resulted in an increased odds ratio ofcase status (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.5-3.6, P = 0.0001) for PG3 compared with other genomic subtypes (PGs and Sf6) (Methods and Supplementary Table 4). The association of cases with the dominant serotype, @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ serotype 2a (accounting for 29% (234/806) of total isolates and 31% (210/687) of case isolates) also resulted in an increased odds ratio of case status (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.7-3.2, P = 0.0099) (Supplementary Table 4).	1
As an example, Prevotella was the only over-abundant (25%) genus reported in saliva samples from @di$ caries @/di$-active individuals. In the present study, the relative abundance of Prevotella at genus level was not distinctive from that found in healthy dental biofilms (carious = 9.4%, healthy = 4.1-19.7%). However, Random Forest analysis revealed that members of the Prevotella genus including Prevotella sp. (strain B31FD), P. histicola and P. multisaccharivorax were distinctive of more acidic pH ranges in carious dentine, while other Prevotella species, such as P. buccae, @gm$ P. dentalis @/gm$ and P. nigrescens, were shared among the core microbiota (Table S6). The above-mentioned study also found P. histicola distinctive of saliva in @di$ caries @/di$-active individuals. Thus, sample type and species or strain level resolution, in addition to a key ecological variable such as pH, is required in @di$ caries @/di$ studies to better understand disease progression.	1
As for AAV, a study using quantitative culture experiments reported that Staphylococcus aureus in BALF was particularly associated with patients with @di$ GPA @/di$ compared with patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). One study using nasal swabs reported decreased @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ and Staphylococcus epidermidis in patients with @di$ GPA @/di$ when compared with healthy controls. Another study using nasal swabs reported increased relative abundance of Planococcaceae family and decreased Moraxellaceae, Tissierellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae families in @di$ GPA @/di$ when compared with healthy controls. A study with culture experiments with nasal swabs reported Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in patients with @di$ GPA @/di$. As for sarcoidosis, in addition to Mycobacterium and @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$, Atopobium and Fusobacterium have been reported as candidates for sarcoidosis-associated microbiota in BALF.	0
As in other gut diseases such as IBD, @di$ colitis @/di$ and colorectal cancer, we found depletion of potentially gut-protective bacteria @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Sphingomonas in patients with inflammation. Sphingomonas is an aerobic and metabolically versatile bacterial genus that was characterised as being depleted in breast cancer tissues compared with healthy breast tissues. @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ is associated with the formation of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid reportedly protective against gut neoplasia.	2
As pentanoate is a rare bacterial metabolite, the low-abundance commensal bacteria @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ is the only bacterium known to synthesize high amounts of pentanoate. In vitro treatment of CTL and @di$ CAR @/di$-T cells with valerate and butyric acid can increase the function of the mTOR pathway, induce metabolic changes, and inhibit HDAC-I. The reprogramming increases the production of effector molecules such as CD25, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha that significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of antigen-specific CTL and @di$ CAR @/di$-T in cancer models.	2
As reported in the Results section, several unique taxa were identified in T1D: Lactobacillus salivarius, Ruminococcus bromii, Prevotella copri, @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The identification of those unique taxa can be partly clarified by the quality of diet consumed by @di$ diabetic @/di$ patients, in addition to the increase of periodontal inflammation among T1D children. Diet has an important role in composition and metabolism of the oral microbiome. We report poor-quality diet among T1D children, which is in line with previous reports of high saturated fat consumption and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods. Such diets are rich in advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are complex heterogeneous compounds derived from non-enzymatic glycation reactions. While dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs) are formed during industrial processing and home cooking, high plasma glucose, as in @di$ diabetes @/di$, accelerates the formation of endogenous AGEs. AGE-modified proteins accumulate within the body and are thought to play a role in a number of age-related diseases including @di$ diabetes @/di$.	0
As shown above, 29 of 57 (51%) of the isolated @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients underwent a gut microbial dysbiosis. To further explore the microbial functional feature of @di$ dystonia @/di$, we performed metagenomic sequencing of a subgroup consisting of 13 patients from MCS2B and 13 gender- and age-matched HCs. An average of 10.7 +- 2.1 Gb of clean reads was generated per sample, except for one HC sample that was removed due to low depth of sequencing (Table S3). Consistent with the 16S rRNA gene analysis, B. obeum, @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$, and E. hallii were significantly increased in @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients, while B. vulgatus and B. plebeius were decreased (Fig. 1F and Fig. S3). In addition, the genera Alistipes and Parabacteroides were also found to be decreased in patients with @di$ dystonia @/di$ in comparison to HCs (Table S2).	1
As stated earlier, @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ CL and ET biotypes differ from each other in phenotypic and genotypic traits and also in the pattern of infection they cause. Many studies have shown that @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ ET is better able to adapt to the environment but is less virulent in clinical manifestation. It can be hypothesized that by adapting to change in the ecosystem and undergoing efficient host-to-host transmission, hybrid-ET @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ are rendered significantly more robust. However, if more severe diarrhea and increased @di$ dehydration @/di$ can be attributed solely to CL biotype CT in an ET biotype @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$, the question then arises as to why the diarrhea and @di$ dehydration @/di$ increased so suddenly, since all @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ ET strains that had been isolated in Dhaka since 2001 have CL biotype CT. One can suggest that the increase in severity of @di$ dehydration @/di$ derived from rapid passage within the very large population of Dhaka, increasing significantly the number of infectious hybrid-ET @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ transmitted, notably during the August 2007 flooding. More plausible, however, is extensive mixing of particulates from the sediment of the urban river and pond system of Dhaka that receives untreated sewage containing infectious @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$, especially during intensively heavy flooding, as occurred in 2007, breaching the flood embankment and contaminating the drinking water sources.	1
As the abundance of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ in the intestinal microbiota of HAEC patients was higher than that in the intestinal microbiota of HSCR patients, we hypothesized that high levels of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ were pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ in the intestine. To investigate the effects of the over-proliferation of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ on the development of HAEC, germ-free C57BL/6N mice were treated with @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ by gavage. The abundance of Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in gut of HSCR patients was higher than that in HAEC patients, so we employed B. fragilis as a negative control in our study. To ensure the quality control in this study, all experiments included were documented to ensure monocolonization only with designated microbe by 16S rDNA sequencing. Besides, feces from different groups were analyzed by deep 16S rDNA sequencing and shown to be pure. Inoculation of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ played a pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ role and promoted the expression of several inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta) in colon (Fig. 1A, B). Next, we tested several markers of apoptosis and tight junction. @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ also induced more apoptosis and impaired the tight junction of colonic epithelial cells (Fig. 1C). Besides, treatment with @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ decreased body weight and affected the mental status of mice (Fig. 1D). The serum inflammatory cytokines didn't increase significantly, and we didn't observe other systemic @di$ inflammation @/di$ responses induced by the gavage of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$.	1
As we observed associations between Subdoligranulum and insulin levels as measures of insulin sensitivity in the @di$ overweight @/di$/obese group, we subjected the mice to an oral glucose test (OGTT) in the last week of @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ administration (Figure 3a). Compared to the control group, mice fed the HFD had higher fasting glucose levels after fasting (time points -30 min and 0 min) and a higher blood glucose profile after being given a glucose load (time points 15 min to 90 min). However, we did not observe an improvement of glucose tolerance in mice supplemented with @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, as evidenced by similar glucose profiles (Figure 3a) and corresponding areas under the curve (AUC, Figure 3c), suggesting that @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ does not impact on overall glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese mice.	0

As we previously mentioned several oral species such as Fusobacterium and @gm$ Porphyromonas @/gm$ are highly detected in CRC. Although many other pathogenic or commensal members of the oral microbiome, such as the genera Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Parvimonas, and Gemella, have also been reported to be increased in CRC, their virulence has not been examined individually. Studies of the former two pathogens have revealed numerous virulence mechanisms with anti-apoptotic and @di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties.	1
At the phylum level, @di$ ME/CFS @/di$ patients showed a significant increase in Bacteroidetes, along with noticeable reductions in Firmicutes compared to healthy controls (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A). Interestingly, some potentially beneficial genera such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium display a notable decrease in @di$ CFS @/di$ patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, Fig.	2
At the phylum level, four major abundant phyla showed significant variations between the @di$ Obesity @/di$ (95.19%) and Control (95.70%) group, including Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Firmicutes (Table 1). In our study, the abundance of Firmicutes decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes increased in people with @di$ obesity @/di$. The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes also decreased. At the family level (Fig 3), a total of six major families had significant difference between the @di$ Obesity @/di$ (56.80%) and Control (47.92%) group. The six major families are Prevotellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Rikenellaceae, and three of them belong to Bacteroidetes. At the genus level (Fig 6), a total of 16 major genera had a significant difference between the @di$ Obesity @/di$ (54.29%) and Control (45.52%) group, and 10 of them belong to Firmicutes. Of the 16 major genera, the abundance of four genera increased, while the remaining 12 decreased among the people with @di$ obesity @/di$. At the species level (OTUs from top 50, Table 2), we found nine abundant species had differences between the @di$ Obesity @/di$ and Control group. Six of them were decreased in @di$ obesity @/di$ gut microbiota, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$, Alistipes putredinis, Bacteroides uniformis, Parabacteroides distasonis and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans. Three species were increased in @di$ obesity @/di$ gut microbiota, including Megamonas funiformis, Prevotella copri and Fusobacterium mortiferum.	1
At the phylum level, the gut bacteriome of @di$ OA @/di$ patients had markedly higher levels of Actinobacteriota (average abundance, 15.6% versus 6.4%; Wilcoxon rank-sum test q < 0.001) and Proteobacteria (7.8% versus 3.3%; q = 0.02) and lower levels of Firmicutes (59.4% versus 68.1%; q = 0.03) than that of the HC subjects (Table S3). At the genus level, 8 genera, including @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$, Bifidobacterium, Brachyspira, and Eggerthella, were enriched in @di$ OA @/di$ subjects compared to HC subjects, while 15 genera, such as Faecalibacterium, Lachnoclostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Paraprevotella, were enriched in the HC subjects (Table S4). In addition, we compared the gut bacteriome of @di$ OA @/di$ and HC subjects at the species level. Two hundred seventy-nine species were identified with significant differences in relative abundance between the two cohorts (Wilcoxon rank-sum test q < 0.05), while 41 of these species were enriched in the @di$ OA @/di$ subjects and 238 of them were enriched in the HC subjects (Fig. 1e; Table S5). The representative @di$ OA @/di$-enriched species included @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ (GENOME147149), Prevotella sp900313215 (GENOME108259), Eubacterium_E hallii A (GENOME000299), Bifidobacterium sp002742445 (GENOME027286), @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ A (GENOME000113), Blautia A (GENOME001004), Catenibacterium sp000437715 (GENOME001490), and Bifidobacterium dentium (GENOME096132), while the HC-enriched species included Bacteroides plebeius A (GENOME239725), Roseburia inulinivorans (GENOME001770), Dialister sp900343095 (GENOME075103), Phascolarctobacterium faecium (GENOME233517), and several members of Faecalibacterium (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii G [GENOME147678], F.	1
At the same time, we identified 17 genera and 17 species that were significantly enriched in the NR group, of which Hungatella hathewayi had been previously reported to induce resistance to ICIs in @di$ renal cell carcinoma @/di$. Analysis at the genetic level further confirmed that @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Parabacteroides merdae, and Eubacterium sp.	1
At the species level, @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ (phylum Bacteroidetes) was increased, particularly during the recovery of iron-supplemented mice. This bacterium is a gram-negative, strict anaerobe. A higher abundance of the @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ genus has been associated with ileal inflammation in a mouse model of spontaneous inflammation of the ileum. Oral gavage with @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ induced intestinal inflammation in wild-type, Il10-/-, and lipocalin 2 knockout (Lcn2-/-) mice. Lcn2 is an antimicrobial protein secreted by the host that sequesters siderophores, limiting iron availability. In Il10-/- mice, Lcn2 deficiency (Lcn2-/-/Il10-/- mice) created a niche for the expansion of facultative pathogenic @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ spp., preferentially colonizing the cecum and proximal colon. When transferred into Il10-/- mice, @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ spp. were sufficient to induce @di$ colitis @/di$ and right-sided tumors, and the authors demonstrated that Lcn2 impacted the in vitro growth of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ spp. by limiting iron availability. These findings suggest that @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ thrives in an iron-rich environment by a mechanism linked to siderophore-mediated iron uptake.	1
At the species level, DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mice showed increased populations of Acetatifactor muris (p < 0.03), Clostridium disporicum (p < 0.03), Parasutterella excrementihominis (p < 0.03), Romboutsia sedimentorum (p < 0.03), and Turicibacter sanguinis (p < 0.03), and decreased populations of Clostridium leptum (p < 0.04), Anaerobacterium chartisolvens (p < 0.03), Barnesiella intestinihominis (p < 0.03), @gm$ Barnesiella viscericola @/gm$ (p < 0.03), Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (p < 0.03), Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.03), Lactobacillus johnsonii (p < 0.03), Natranaerovirga pectinivora (p < 0.03), Porphyromonas catoniae (p < 0.03), Ruminococcus faecis (p < 0.03), and Vallitalea pronyensis (p < 0.03) compared to normal controls (Figure 5O). Administration of T. halophilus reduced Alistipes finegoldii (p < 0.04), Clostridium disporicum (p < 0.03), Parasutterella excrementihominis (p < 0.03), Romboutsia sedimentorum (p < 0.03), and Turicibacter sanguinis (p < 0.03), and increased bacterial populations of Clostridium saccharolyticum (p < 0.03), Akkermansia muciniphila (p < 0.03), Anaerobacterium chartisolvens (p < 0.03), Barnesiella intestinihominis (p < 0.03), Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (p < 0.03), Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.04), Lactobacillus johnsonii (p < 0.03), and Ruminococcus lactaris (p < 0.03) in @di$ colitis @/di$ mice (Figure 5O).	2
At the species level, significantly enriched species in kwashiorkor (Figure 4) included Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bifidobacterium breve, @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$, Gemella haemolysans, Hafnia alvei, Rothia aeria, Staphylococcus hominis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, and Streptococcus lutetiensis. These species are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics (Marrie and Kwan,; Moubareck et al.,; Stock et al.,; Michon et al.,; Carlier et al.,) which are used in kwashiorkor treatment (Lazzerini and Tickell,; Trehan et al.,; Million et al.,). Species such as G. haemolysans, H. alvei, S. gallolyticus, and S. lutetiensis are potentially pathogenic and have been previously associated with diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and @di$ endocarditis @/di$ (Helft et al.,; Abbott et al.,; Jin et al.,).	0
At two weeks post-infection lesions were analyzed for immune responses and @di$ parasite @/di$ burden. There was no difference in skin IFN-gamma production from alphabeta T cells in S. epidermidis colonized and L. major infected mice compare to L. major infected mice alone (Fig 3A and 3B), and the numbers of L. major parasites were similar in both groups (Fig 3C). We also assessed L. major specific IFN-gamma by activating the cells from skin draining lymph node with L. major antigen in vitro and found no difference in IFN-gamma production in S. epidermidis colonized and L. major infected mice compared to L. major infected mice (Fig 3D). Next, we similarly evaluated the effect of @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ on skin IFN-gamma production from alphabeta T and @di$ parasite @/di$ load; mice colonized with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ before L. major infection exhibited no difference in IFN-gamma production from alphabeta T cells or any difference in @di$ parasite @/di$ burden (Fig 3E-3G).	0
At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental @di$ gingivitis @/di$ protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars.	1
Atherosclerosis is the main cause of myocardial infarction and @di$ stroke @/di$, and the morbidity and mortality rates of cardiovascular disease are among the highest of any disease worldwide. Excessive plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), an intestinal metabolite, promotes the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, effective measures for reducing plasma TMAO production can contribute to preventing atherosclerosis. Probiotics are living microorganisms that are beneficial to the human body, and some of them can attenuate plasma TMAO production. To explore the effects of probiotic supplementation on plasma TMAO in choline-fed mice, we intragastrically administered eight strains of Bifidobacterium breve and eight strains of @gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$ to mice for 6 weeks.	2
Attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica (@gm$ S. enterica) serovar Typhimurium @/gm$ were first explored as delivery vectors for anticancer therapeutics in the mid 1990s. Since then, S. enterica tumor vaccines have shown efficacy in experimental animal models against multiple tumor types including @di$ colorectal, melanoma @/di$, breast, bone, spine, liver, pancreatic, prostate, and lung. In our experimental models, we have focused on the efficacy of an avirulent and highly immunogenic strain, S. enterica @gm$ Typhimurium @/gm$ chi4550, that was engineered to express a human interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene in primary and experimental metastasis models. In these studies, S. enterica chi4550 expressing a human IL-2 gene was effective at reducing the number and volume of hepatic metastases both when administered before and after tumor introduction. Decreased tumor burden in these models was inversely correlated with increased hepatic natural killer (NK) cell populations and when depleted, S. enterica chi4550's antitumor properties were abolished. Most recently, we have demonstrated that S. enterica @gm$ Typhimurium @/gm$ expressing a C-terminal truncated human IL-2 gene (SalpIL2) reduced osteosarcoma lung metastases and significantly increased the number of detectable NK cells in the lung as compared to S.	2
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$ is a predominant cause of Legionnaires' disease in some parts of the world, particularly in Australasia. Clinical reports of L. longbeachae infection are limited to case reports or small case series, and culture-confirmed cases. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of @di$ L. longbeachae pneumonia @/di$ in a large case series from Christchurch, New Zealand during a 4-year period when both PCR and cultures were used as routine diagnostic tools for Legionnaires' disease.	1
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ (@gm$ OF @/gm$) may play a protective role in preventing calcium oxalate stones. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of antibiotics on OF colonization. Intestinal colonization by @gm$ OF @/gm$ is associated with reduced urinary oxalate excretion. Exposure to antibiotics may be an important factor determining rates of colonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of antibiotics on OF colonization was compared in two groups: A group receiving antibiotics for gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) and a group without HP whose members were not receiving antibiotics. OF colonization in stool was detected by oxalate degradation at baseline and after 1 and 6 months. RESULTS: The prevalence at baseline of intestinal colonization with @gm$ OF @/gm$ was 43.1% among all patients screened. Among the 12 patients who were positive for @gm$ OF @/gm$ who did not receive antibiotics, 11 (92%) had @gm$ OF @/gm$ on stool tests at 1 month and 6 months. Of the 19 participants who were positive for @gm$ OF @/gm$ and who received antibiotics for HP, only 7 (36.8%) continued to be colonized by @gm$ OF @/gm$ on follow-up stool testing at 1 and 6 months (P=0.003 by Fisher exact test). Amoxicillin and clarithromycin caused 62.5% of subjects to become negative for @gm$ OF @/gm$ at 1 month; 56.2% remained negative for @gm$ OF @/gm$ at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics for HP infection effectively reduced colonization with @gm$ OF @/gm$, an effect present at 1 and 6 months after treatment. The lasting elimination of @gm$ OF @/gm$ could be associated with @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$ and be a factor in recurrent kidney stone disease.	2
BACKGROUND: @di$ Cardiac sarcoidosis @/di$ (@di$ CS @/di$) is a noncaseating granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Lifelong immunosuppressive therapy, most frequently using corticosteroids, is a standard therapy to control hypersensitivity of immune reactions and prevent inflammation. However, it sometimes causes various systemic adverse effects and requires dose escalation. Thus, additional therapy may be required for the treatment of this disease. Recently, @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ (@gm$ P. acnes @/gm$) was reported as one of the etiologic agents of @di$ CS @/di$, indicating that antibacterial drugs (ABD) may be effective for the treatment of @di$ CS @/di$. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ABD treatment, in addition to standard corticosteroid therapy, in patients with @di$ CS @/di$. METHODS: The Japanese Antibacterial Drug Management for @di$ Cardiac Sarcoidosis @/di$ (J-ACNES) trial was designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial. The patients will be randomized to receive either standard corticosteroid therapy plus ABD therapy (ABD group) or standard corticosteroid therapy (standard group). The primary endpoint is change in the total standardized uptake value at 6 months vs baseline using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. Secondary endpoints include efficacy, prognosis, and safety. RESULTS: The results of this study are currently under investigation. CONCLUSION: The J-ACNES trial will be the first prospective study assessing the clinical benefit and safety of ABD therapy, in addition to corticosteroid treatment, in patients with @di$ CS @/di$. Our findings may improve treatment of patients with @di$ CS @/di$, as additional ABD therapy reduces recurrence of inflammation and elucidates the mechanism of @di$ sarcoidosis @/di$.	1
BACKGROUND: @di$ Cervicitis @/di$ is an inflammatory condition of the cervix associated with upper genital tract infection and reproductive complications. Although @di$ cervicitis @/di$ can be caused by several known pathogens, the etiology frequently remains obscure. Here we investigate vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis as potential causes of @di$ cervicitis @/di$. METHODS: Associations between vaginal bacteria and @di$ cervicitis @/di$ were assessed in a retrospective case-control study of women attending a Seattle sexually transmitted disease clinic. Individual bacterial species were detected using 2 molecular methods: quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR with pyrosequencing. The primary finding from this initial study was evaluated using qPCR in a second cohort of Kenyan women. RESULTS: The presence of @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, formerly BVAB3, in the cervix was associated with @di$ cervicitis @/di$, whereas the presence of Lactobacillus jensenii was inversely associated. Quantities of these bacteria did not differ between @di$ cervicitis @/di$ cases and controls, although in a model inclusive of presence and abundance, M. indolicus remained significantly associated with @di$ cervicitis @/di$ after adjustment for other @di$ cervicitis @/di$-causing pathogens. M. indolicus was not associated with @di$ cervicitis @/di$ in our study of Kenyan women, possibly due to differences in the clinical definition of @di$ cervicitis @/di$. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of the endocervix with M. indolicus may contribute to the clinical manifestations of @di$ cervicitis @/di$, but further study is needed to determine whether this finding is repeatable and applicable to diverse groups of women.	1
BACKGROUND: @di$ Obesity @/di$ is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. In order to clarify the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics (LCP) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. We intended to assess effects by Lactobacillus species. METHODS: A broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. We primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Results were pooled by host and by Lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (SMDs). RESULTS: We identified and included 17 RCTs in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. Lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (SMD 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). Results were consistent in humans and animals. Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ was associated with weight loss both in @di$ obese @/di$ humans and in animals.	2
BACKGROUND: @di$ Obesity @/di$ is associated with increased health risk and has been associated with alterations in bacterial gut microbiota, with mainly a reduction in Bacteroidetes, but few data exist at the genus and species level. It has been reported that the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus representatives may have a critical role in weight regulation as an anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effect in experimental models and humans, or as a growth-promoter effect in agriculture depending on the strains. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To confirm reported gut alterations and test whether Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species found in the human gut are associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ or lean status, we analyzed the stools of 68 @di$ obese @/di$ and 47 controls targeting Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis and seven species of Lactobacillus by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture on a Lactobacillus-selective medium. FINDINGS: In qPCR, B. animalis (odds ratio (OR)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.01; P=0.056) and @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ (OR=0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.97; P=0.03) were associated with normal weight whereas Lactobacillus reuteri (OR=1.79; 95% CI 1.03-3.10; P=0.04) was associated with @di$ obesity @/di$. CONCLUSION: The gut microbiota associated with human @di$ obesity @/di$ is depleted in @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$. Some Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus species were associated with normal weight (B. animalis) while others (L. reuteri) were associated with @di$ obesity @/di$. Therefore, gut microbiota composition at the species level is related to body weight and @di$ obesity @/di$, which might be of relevance for further studies and the management of @di$ obesity @/di$. These results must be considered cautiously because it is the first study to date that links specific species of Lactobacillus with @di$ obesity @/di$ in humans.	2
BACKGROUND: @di$ Otitis media @/di$ is an extremely common pediatric infection and is mostly caused by bacteria that are carried within the nasopharyngeal microbiota. It is clear that most @di$ otitis media @/di$ cases involve simultaneous infection with multiple agents. METHODS: Chinchillas were infected with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$, or a combination of both organisms, and the course of disease was compared.	1
BACKGROUND: @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ is a non-choleric halophilic vibrion widely distributed in marine environments. Contamination in humans is uncommon except in coastal areas of the United States and Asia. We report the first documented case in the French West Indies. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old native with alcoholic cirrhosis was hospitalized for septic shock. The infectious syndrome began suddenly a few hours earlier with fever, diarrhea, and intense pain in the calf muscles. In the absence of a suspected agent, a wide spectrum antibiotic was prescribed. On day 3, bullae developed over the legs and progressed, despite early surgical debridement, to bilateral rapidly extensive necrosing @di$ cellulitis @/di$. An above the knee amputation was required but did not prevent death on day 9 due to irreversible multiple organ failure. Blood cultures were positive for @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$. DISCUSSION: Primary septicemia due to @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is mainly observed in subjects with an underlying liver disease and usually occurs after ingestion of contamined raw halieutic products such as oysters.	1
BACKGROUND: Among the microorganisms corresponding to the genus @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ is a species of low epidemiological incidence compared to Acinetobacter baumannii. However, it has a comparable infectious capacity since it can be involved in severe diseases like bacteremia or @di$ meningitis @/di$.	1
BACKGROUND: Anti-@gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ (HP) IgA and IgG antibody titers were measured in patients with ischemic heart diseases. METHODS: There were 60 healthy individuals that served as control subjects, and 21 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 34 with old myocardial infarctions (OMI), 35 with @di$ effort angina @/di$ (AP) and 41 with vasospastic angina (VSA).	0
BACKGROUND: Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) acts as a salivary biomimetic that provides bioavailable calcium and phosphate ions to augment fluoride-mediated remineralisation of early @di$ caries lesions @/di$. However, there are indications that it may also have beneficial ecological effects on the oral microbiome. OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study investigated whether CPP-ACP could influence microbial counts, acidogenicity, and the relative abundance of specific @di$ caries @/di$- and health-associated bacterial -species in polymicrobial biofilms. METHODS: Saliva-derived polymicrobial biofilms were grown for 96 h in a cariogenic environment and treated every 12 h with 2% CPP-ACP or vehicle control. Colony forming units (CFUs) and acidogenicity were estimated from the treated biofilms. Microbial ecological effects of CPP-ACP were assessed based on the relative abundance of 14 specific @di$ caries @/di$- and health-associated -bacterial species using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. -Results: CPP-ACP-treated biofilms showed relatively modest, but significant, reductions in microbial CFUs (21% reduction, p = 0.008) and acidogenicity (33% reduction, p < 0.001), compared to the control-treated biofilms. The CPP-ACP treated biofilms also exhibited significantly lower bacterial loads of cariogenic Scardovia wiggsiae (fold change 0.017, p < 0.001) and @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$(fold change 0.005, p < 0.001), and higher bacterial loads of commensal Streptococcus sanguinis(fold change 30.22, p < 0.001), S.	2
BACKGROUND: Different @di$ periodontal @/di$ treatment methods (quadrant-wise debridement, scaling and root planing (Q-SRP), full-mouth scaling (FMS), full-mouth disinfection (FMD), and FMD with adjuvant erythritol air-polishing (FMDAP)) were applied in @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients (stage III/IV). The study objective (substudy of ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03509233) was to compare the impact of treatments on subgingival colonization. METHODS: Forty patients were randomized to the treatment groups. @di$ Periodontal @/di$ parameters and subgingival colonization were evaluated at baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: Positive changes in clinical parameters were recorded in every treatment group during the 3-month follow-up period, but did not always continue. In three groups, specific bacteria decreased after 3 months; however, this was associated with a renewed increase after 6 months (FMS: Porphyromonas gingivalis; FMD: Eubacterium nodatum, @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$; and FMDAP: uncultured Prevotella sp.). CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of all clinical treatments measured after 3 months was associated with a decrease in pathogenic bacteria in the FMS, FMD, and FMDAP groups. However, after 6 months, we observed further improvement or some stagnation in clinical outcomes accompanied by deterioration of the microbiological profile. Investigating the subgingival microbiota might help appraise successful @di$ periodontal @/di$ treatment and implement individualized therapy.	1
BACKGROUND: Emollients are a mainstay of treatment in @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ (@di$ AD @/di$), a disease distinguished by skin bacterial dysbiosis. However, changes in skin microbiota when emollients are used as a potential @di$ AD @/di$ preventative measure in infants remain incompletely characterized. RESULTS: We compared skin barrier parameters, @di$ AD @/di$ development, and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of cheek, dorsal and volar forearm samples from 6-month-old infants with a family history of atopy randomized to receive emollients (n = 11) or no emollients (controls, n = 12). The emollient group had a lower skin pH than the control group. The number of bacterial taxa in the emollient group was higher than in the control group at all sites. The @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ proportion was higher in the emollient versus control groups at all sites. @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ proportion appeared higher in infants without @di$ AD @/di$ compared to infants with @di$ AD @/di$. A decrease in @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ abundance was further identified in a separate larger population of older children demonstrating an inverse correlation between @di$ AD @/di$ severity at sampling sites and @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ proportions. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased skin pH and the increased proportion of @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ after long-term emollient use in infants at risk for developing @di$ AD @/di$ may contribute to the preventative effects of emollients in high-risk infants.	2
BACKGROUND: Impaired microbial development and decreased levels of short chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate, is suggested to have a role in the development of @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ (@di$ AD @/di$). METHODS: Faecal microbiota composition, abundance of selected bacterial groups and fermentation metabolites were compared at 90, 180 and 360 days of life between 27 children who developed @di$ AD @/di$ by age one (@di$ AD @/di$ group), and 39 controls (non-@di$ AD @/di$ group) among the CARE (Childhood AlleRgy, nutrition and Environment) study cohort. RESULTS: Diversity within the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum in the faecal microbiota was lower in the @di$ AD @/di$ group compared to the non-@di$ AD @/di$ group. Longitudinal analysis showed multiple amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within the same bacterial family to be differentially abundant. Namely, @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$, a keystone primary starch degrader, and Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-utilizer, had lower abundance among the @di$ AD @/di$ group. Children with @di$ AD @/di$ were less likely to have high levels of faecal butyrate at 360 days compared to those without @di$ AD @/di$ (11.5% vs 34.2%). At 360 days, children with high abundance of @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ had higher level of butyrate as well as lower proportion of children with @di$ AD @/di$ compared to children with low abundance of @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ (11.1-12.5% vs 44.4-52.5%), which was independent of the abundance of the major butyrate producers. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ and other primary degraders might play an important role in the differences in microbial cross-feeding and metabolite formation between children with and without @di$ AD @/di$, which may influence the risk of developing the disease.	2
BACKGROUND: MRx1234 is a live biotherapeutic product that contains a strain of @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$. It is in development for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of MRx1234 in patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C) or @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ (IBS-D) METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.	0
BACKGROUND: Odontogenic brain abscess is a rare case primarily caused by normal flora such as @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-years-old Indonesian female complained of severe left side headaches, hearing loss, a decrease of consciousness, several episodes of nausea and @di$ vomiting @/di$, and hemiparesis dextra for 5 days. Three months previously, she performed dental operative procedures on the left side of the first and second lower molar and debridement of phlegmon on the left side of the mouth. Head CT scan suggests multiple brain abscesses or high-grade glioma, non-communicating hydrocephalus and suggestive mastoiditis. The patient underwent excision surgery and abscess culture, which resulted in @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$.	1

BACKGROUND: Recurrent @di$ abdominal pain @/di$ is a common and costly health-care problem attributed, in part, to visceral hypersensitivity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut bacteria contribute to @di$ abdominal pain @/di$ perception by modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, specific microbial signals remain poorly defined. gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter and a key regulator of abdominal and central pain perception from peripheral afferent neurons. Although gut bacteria are reported to produce GABA, it is not known whether the microbial-derived neurotransmitter modulates @di$ abdominal pain @/di$. METHODS: To investigate the potential analgesic effects of microbial GABA, we performed daily oral administration of a specific @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strain (B. dentiumATCC 27678) in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity, and subsequently evaluated pain responses. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrate that commensal @gm$ Bifidobacterium dentium @/gm$ produces GABA via enzymatic decarboxylation of glutamate by GadB. Daily oral administration of this specific @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ (but not a gadB deficient) strain modulated sensory neuron activity in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The functional significance of microbial-derived GABA was demonstrated by gadB-dependent desensitization of colonic afferents in a murine model of visceral hypersensitivity. Visceral pain modulation represents another potential health benefit attributed to bifidobacteria and other GABA-producing species of the intestinal microbiome. Targeting GABAergic signals along this microbiome-gut-brain axis represents a new approach for the treatment of @di$ abdominal pain @/di$.	2
BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies (subsp.) @gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$, previously known as @gm$ Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2 @/gm$, has been described as a causative agent of endocarditis, neonatal sepsis, meningitis, bacteremia, and colorectal carcinoma in humans. The aim of this study was to characterize the erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes of S. gallolyticus subsp. @gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ strains isolated from patients with @di$ septicemia @/di$ and bacteremia in Thailand. METHODS: The clinical isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus were identified by using conventional biochemical tests, PCR, and sodA gene sequence analysis. The erythromycin and tetracycline susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the resistance genes were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 108 blood cultures, 36 (33%) were identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. @gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ with the nucleotide sequence identities of partial sodA gene with the reference strains ranging from 98.1 to 100%.	1
BACKGROUND: The impact of infection with @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ in @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$, other chronic airway diseases and immunosuppressed patients is unknown. METHODS: A six-year retrospective review of all patients with B. gladioli infection was performed in a tertiary referral center with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ and lung transplantation programs. In addition, a targeted survey of all 251 lung transplant recipients was performed. Available @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ isolates were analyzed via pulsed field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were culture positive for @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$, including 33 @di$ CF @/di$ patients. No bacteremia was identified. Isolates were available in 18 patients and all were genetically distinct. Two-thirds of these isolates were susceptible to usual anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. After acquisition, only 40% of @di$ CF @/di$ patients were chronically infected (> or =2 positive cultures separated by at least 6 months). Chronic infection was associated with resistance to > or =2 antibiotic groups on initial culture and failure of eradication after antibiotic therapy. The impact of acquisition of B. gladioli infection in chronic infection was variable. Three @di$ CF @/di$ patients with chronic infection underwent lung transplantation. One post-transplant patient developed a @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ mediastinal abscess, which was treated successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients' culture positive for @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ at our center have @di$ CF @/di$.	1
BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is an acute infection characterized by prolonged @di$ fever @/di$ following the ingestion and subsequent invasion of @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi @/gm$ (@gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$), a human-restricted pathogen. The incidence of typhoid fever has been most reported in children 5-15 years of age, but is increasingly recognized in children younger than 5 years old. There has been a recent expansion of multidrug-resistant typhoid fever globally. Prior typhoid vaccines were not suitable for use in the youngest children in countries with a high burden of disease. This study aims to determine the efficacy of a typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) that was recently prequalified by the World Health Organization, by testing it in children 9 months through 12 years of age in Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS: In this Phase III, individually randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of the clinical efficacy of TCV, 28 000 children 9 months through 12 years of age will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Vi-TCV or a meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine. A subset of 600 of these children will be further enrolled in an immunogenicity and reactogenicity sub-study to evaluate the safety profile and immune response elicited by Vi-TCV. Recruiting began in February 2018. RESULTS: All children will be under passive surveillance for at least 2 years to determine the primary outcome, which is blood culture-confirmed @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ illness.	1
BU is caused by infection with @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ (@gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$). It is the third most common mycobacterial disease in immunocompetent persons. In early disease stages BU presents as a painless nodule, plaque or oedema. Without treatment these lesions go on to ulcerate presenting with characteristic undermined edges. The lesions are divided in three categories; Category I: a single lesion <5cm in diameter. Category II: a single lesion 5-15cm in diameter. Category III: single lesion >15cm in diameter, multiple lesions, lesions at critical sites such as eye, breasts, genitalia and @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$.	1
Background @di$ Community acquired urinary tract infections @/di$ (@di$ caUTI @/di$) in adults are common ailments. Older adults are prone to infectious diseases, diagnosis can be difficult, their etiologic and antimicrobial resistance are poorly known. Objectives To evaluate the incidence discriminated by sex, symptoms, and to determine pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance rate. Methods A retrospective, descriptive and comparative study. We analyze uricultures among 2013 in the Hospital Nacional de Clinicas (Cordoba-Argentina). Patients over 65 years old, admitted with a @di$ caUTI @/di$ diagnose were included; we exclude those with urinary catheter. Variables used: Sex, symptoms, pathogen isolation, antimicrobial resistance. For symptom variable was performed a comparative test. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze remaining variables. Results Were analyzed 349 patients: 1) Positive uricultures 191 (case), negative 158 (control). 2) Average age 77 (76% women, 24% men). 3) Symptoms: fever (45%), sepsis criteria (17%), altered mental status (14%), heart failure (11%). 4) Uriculture: monomicrobial 95.29%. 5) Isolation and resistance rate: @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$ (67,7%): ampicillin/sulbactam 52.7%, ciprofloxacin 51.9%, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 45.7%, cefotaxime: 12,9 %, amikacin: 3,9 %, Klebsiella pneumoniae (11,97%): ciprofloxacin 60.8%, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole 50%, cefotaxime 47.8%, amikacin 4.7%. Enterococcus spp. (9,89%): ampicillin 0%, vancomycin 0%. Also isolated: Candida spp. (3.66%), Proteus mirabilis (2,6%), Staphylococcus aureus (2,6%), Enterobacter cloacae (1,56%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,56%). There were no imipenem resistances among gram negatives. Conclusions Isolations were mostly monomicrobial and at female gender. @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ was the main uropathogen.	1
Background: A few recent studies have characterized the salivary microbiome in association with @di$ Autism Spectrum Disorder @/di$ (@di$ ASD @/di$). Here, we sought to assess if there is an association between the tongue microbiome and @di$ ASD @/di$. Methods: Tongue scrapping samples were obtained from 25 children with @di$ ASD @/di$ and 38 neurotypical controls. The samples were sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene (V1-V3) and the resultant high-quality reads were assigned to the species-level using our previously described BLASTn-based algorithm. Downstream analyses of microbial profiles were conducted using QIIME, LEfSe, and R. Results: Independent of grouping, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Veillonella, Haemophilus and Rothia accounted for > 60% of the average microbiome. Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Rothia mucilaginosa, @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ and Neisseria flavescens/subflava were the most abundant species. Species richness and diversity did not significantly differ between the study groups. Thirteen species and three genera were differentially abundant between the two groups, e.g. enrichment of Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces lingnae and depletion of Campylobacter concisus and Streptococcus vestibularis in the @di$ ASD @/di$ group. However, none of them withstood adjustment for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: The tongue microbiome of children with @di$ ASD @/di$ was not significantly different from that of healthy control children, which is largely consistent with results from the literature.	0
Bacteria associated with necrotizing fasciitis include @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species . @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ organisms are Gram-negative small bacilli isolated from a variety of environmental sources including water, seafood, meat and vegetables, with the ability to colonize both humans and animals . The clinical spectrum of Aeromonas species infection in humans includes acute gastroenteritis, hepatobiliary tract infection, pneumonia, empyema, meningitis, septic arthritis, @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, endocarditis, bacteremia, burn and wound infection .	1
Bacteria of the genus Bacteroides comprise over 25% of the bacterial species within the human colon.@gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (@gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$) is a normal part of the gut microbiota and typically accounts for 0.5% of human colonic flora, as isolated from the stool.@gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ within the gastrointestinal tract promotes host nutrition and regulatory immune function. It produces a zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide (polysaccharide A) that can initiate regulatory T cell responses through formation of a polysaccharide-major histocompatibility (MHC) class II complex. In contrast, @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ is also the most commonly isolated anaerobic pathogen associated with @di$ opportunistic infections @/di$, and expresses a variety of virulence factors.	1
Bacteria of the genus Shigella are important members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and cause acute @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in humans and animals. This pathogen has been historically divided into 4 subgroups based on biochemical properties and group-specific O antigens in the outer membrane, specifically subgroups A (S. dysenteriae), B (S. flexneri), C (@gm$ S. boydii @/gm$) and D (S.	1
Bacteria that have been observed to biotransform daidzein to ODMA in vitro include @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$  and Clostridium sp HGH 136 . @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ has also been observed to metabolize other polyphenolic compounds to phenolic acids in vitro . The presence of ODMA-producing bacteria may be relevant in the biotransformation of other polyphenolic compounds associated with human disease risk or in the production of other metabolic signaling molecules that may influence adiposity; this hypothesis could be evaluated in future studies. Microbial diversity has been associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ in other studies . It is possible that the ODMA-producer phenotype reflects differences in microbial diversity across producers and non-producers, and it is this diversity that is related to @di$ obesity @/di$.	0
Bacterial grain rot and panicle blight is caused mainly by bacteria, such as Burkholderia glumae and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$. The disease threatens rice cultivation, with up to 75% of the drop being lost in heavily infected fields. The disease was originally identified in Japan, where seedling blight and grain rot were caused by B. glumae on rice. B. glumae can cooperatively interact with the air-borne fungal pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, on rice grains, leading to potentially huge losses in crop yield. @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ can also produce similar symptoms of panicle blight and seed rot on rice. The disease has spread to other rice-growing regions including other East-Asian countries, the United States, and South America. Several symptoms are associated with @di$ infections @/di$ of B. glumae and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ on rice seedlings and on grains, including aborted kernels, unfilled grains, and discoloration.	1
Bacterial pathogens of the taxonomic groups @gm$ Listeria @/gm$, Mycobacterium or Streptococcus caused severe infections in adults and the elderly such as @di$ meningitis @/di$ but also opportunistic skin diseases of varied severities.	1
Bacteroides fragilis accounts for 63 percent of all the group isolates, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 14 percent, Bacteroides vulgatus and @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$ for seven percent each, Bacteroides distasonis for six percent and Bacteroides uniformis for two percent. All members of the group induced bacteremia that was associated with an average mortality of 27 percent. The B. fragilis group resist beta lactam antibiotics by producing the enzyme beta-lactamase. This enzyme can be detected in @di$ abscess @/di$ fluid, and can interfere with the eradication of other bacteria that are susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins. All members of the B. fragilis group can become encapsulated during an inflammatory process as was demonstrated in a subcutaneous @di$ abscess @/di$ model in mice.	1
Based on a meta-analysis, genus @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ was found to significantly decrease in many diseases ( to). Moreover, @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ species are butyrate producers, which have many beneficial effects on host fitness. E. callanderi is a core @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$ species; however, its functions in host health have not yet been characterized. Therefore, we screened the effects of E. callanderi on human health. We used EcCFS to examine the inhibitory activity of this strain against CRC, @di$ IBD @/di$, CDI, and obesity in our established in vitro assays, because it has been reported that bacterial CFSs possess many bioactive agents influencing human health ( to).	2
Based on all these observations, we can conclude that the presence of Bacilli, Negativicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Coprococcus, Escherichia and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ seem to be related to radiation-induced toxicity in human @di$ cancer @/di$ patients, whereas Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Sutterella, Parabacteroides and Turicibacter are associated with radiation-induced toxicity in mice ( Figure 2 ). However, Sutterella and Parabacteroides seem to be associated with less toxicity in @di$ cancer @/di$ patients. In addition, Faecalibacterium and Oscillibacter reduce toxicity and the contribution of Bacteroides remains unclear. Nevertheless, comparison of mice and human data is difficult, since besides intrinsic differences in their microbiome, there is a lack of data about the role of the microbiome in radiotherapy-induced toxicity in @di$ cancer @/di$-bearing mice.	1
Based on the correlation analysis, we found that Alloprevotella, Bacteroides,Lachnosporiaincertae pedis, and Parabacteroides had significant positive correlation with the uric acid levels of the @di$ obese hyperuricemic @/di$ mice (Table 2). The two strains of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ and Tannerella were negatively correlated with the uric acid levels and they had a certain inhibitory effect on the uric acid in the @di$ obese hyperuricemic @/di$ mice. The result of linear regression analysis indicated that the intestinal flora could have an important effect on the uric acid levels of the @di$ obese hyperuricemic @/di$ mice.	2
Because it has both antimicrobial and anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties and low toxicity to mammalian cells, zinc has been used as a therapeutic agent for centuries to treat a variety of infectious and non-infectious conditions. While the usefulness of zinc-based therapies in caries prevention is controversial, zinc is incorporated into toothpaste and mouthwash formulations to prevent gingivitis and halitosis. Despite this widespread use of zinc in oral healthcare, the mechanisms that allow @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, a keystone pathogen in dental caries and prevalent etiological agent of infective endocarditis, to overcome zinc toxicity are largely unknown. Here, we discovered that @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ is inherently more tolerant to high zinc stress than all other species of streptococci tested, including commensal streptococci associated with oral health. Using a transcriptome approach, we uncovered several potential strategies utilized by @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ to overcome zinc toxicity. Among them, we identified a previously uncharacterized P-type ATPase transporter and cognate transcriptional regulator, which we named ZccE and ZccR respectively, as responsible for the remarkable high zinc tolerance of @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$. In addition to zinc, we found that ZccE, which was found to be unique to @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$ strains, mediates tolerance to at least three additional metal ions, namely cadmium, cobalt, and copper. Loss of the ability to maintain zinc homeostasis when exposed to high zinc stress severely disturbed zinc:manganese ratios, leading to heightened peroxide sensitivity that was alleviated by manganese supplementation. Finally, we showed that the ability of the DeltazccE strain to stably colonize the rat tooth surface after topical zinc treatment was significantly impaired, providing proof of concept that ZccE and ZccR are suitable targets for the development of antimicrobial therapies specifically tailored to kill @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$.	1
Bee pollen affected microbiota composition and @di$ melanoma @/di$ development. Differential abundance revealed higher abundance in the control group for Aeromonadaceae family, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas genus, A. sobria, A. schubertii, A. jandaei and P. alcaligenes species compared with pollen diet group. Pollen group presented higher abundance for Chromobacterium genus and for Gemmobacter aquaticus, Flavobacterium succinicans and @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ compared with control group.	2
Benitez-Paez et al studied the abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ in the gut microbiota of obese children, and indicated that @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ help reduce inflammation causally linked to obesity-related complications. Zhao et al found that CHB can disrupt the balance of gut microbiota and that the change in its abundance is associated with liver injury. Our research results confirmed that the prevalence of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ was significantly lower in the stool of patients with HBV-LC than that of healthy adults. This suggests that the abundance of probiotic flora reduced and the intestinal protection ability was weakened when CHB developed with @di$ cirrhosis @/di$.	2
Besides Bacillus anthracis, other examples of agents used in bioterrorism attacks can be presented: Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (typhoid fever), @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ (dysentery), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Variola major and Variola minor viruses (@di$ smallpox @/di$), Rickettsia prowazekii (typhus), Ascaris suum (ascariasis); and toxins such as those produced by Clostridium botulinum (botulism), Corynebacterium diphtheria (diphtheria), Staphylococcus aureus [e.g., toxic shock syndrome (TSS), staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), necrotizing pneumonia, or deep-seated skin infections] and V.	0
Besides the many bacterial species, the human gut contains several archaeal species but only three distinct species within the group of methanogenic archaea have been isolated from human faeces, Methanobrevibacter smithii, @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ and Methanomassilicoccus luminyesis. M. smithii belonging to the Methanobacteriaceae family is the dominant archaeon in the human gut ecosystem. In children from 1 to 10 years of age, the prevalence of M. smithii has been found in 88%. This organism plays an important role in the efficient digestion of polysaccharides (complex sugars) by consuming the end products of bacterial fermentation. Metagenomics studies of the gut microbial communities in genetically @di$ obese @/di$ mice have shown that M. smithii exhibited an enhanced expression of the genes involved in polysaccharide degradation and possess a greater capacity to promote adiposity when transplanted into germ-free recipients. A recent research showed that M. smithii colonization was associated with an increased risk of overweight children from 6 to 10 years of age. M. smithii may thus be a therapeutic target for childhood overweight and @di$ obesity @/di$ by reducing energy harvesting.	1
Besides the many traditional beneficial effects reported, the efficacy of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. on the outcomes of anticancer therapies is the subject of extensive ongoing research. Substantially reduced tumor growth rates and improved responses to anti-PD-L1 therapy were observed in mice. Significantly, a probiotic cocktail consisting of B. breve and B. longum potentiates the antitumour efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. The increased efficacy was, at least in part, mediated by the activation of DCs, leading to enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation within the tumor microenvironment (TME). On top of these, Bifidobacteriumspp. as probiotics also gained much attention on cancer development and therapy against @di$ colitis @/di$ and CRC.	2
Bile acids are primarily used to eliminate excess cholesterol in the body and help improve @di$ AS @/di$. Studies have shown that anaerobes and facultative anaerobes in the large intestine synthesize primary bile acids into secondary bile acids; after entering the blood, these regulate the metabolism of lipids and glucose in the body through nuclear and G-protein-coupled receptors. In addition, butyrate, an SCFA, significantly reduced the expression of genes such as NF-kappaB, INF-gamma, TLR, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), inhibited the inflammatory response, and slowed the development of @di$ AS @/di$. It is also believed that @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Other metabolites of the gut microbiota, such as indole derivatives and polyamines, also have an inhibitory effect on @di$ AS @/di$.	2
Biofilms in human cervical tissue may also impact other @di$ cervical infections @/di$ such as HPV entry and replication, but they are poorly characterized. For gonorrhea, infection of the endocervix involves biofilms, and the ectocervix contains tissue-adherent anaerobic Lactobacilli. Gardnerella species adhere strongly to vaginal cells, colonize the vaginal epithelium, and form a biofilm which serves as a scaffold where other species can attach and even resist antibiotic treatment for BV. While some BV-associated species lack key virulence traits, we found that samples with higher abundances of Prevotella, Sneathia, @gm$ BVAB1 @/gm$, and @gm$ BVAB2 @/gm$ coexisted with Gardnerella but were not present in Lactobacillus-dominated tissue samples.	1
Botulinum toxin (BT) is a neurotoxin produced by @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. Systemic human intoxication from BT following oral ingestion results in acute and life-threatening @di$ muscle paralysis @/di$ called botulism.	1
Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is a neurotoxin derived from @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$. It acts via inhibiting release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, causing relaxation of the muscle. BTX-A has been shown to be a promising option for treatment of headache. It was further approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of headache in adults suffering from @di$ chronic migraine @/di$.	2
Botulism is a muscle-paralyzing disease caused by neurotoxins (types A-G) produced by the bacteria @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$. Symptoms of food-borne botulism most commonly appear 12-36 h after eating contaminated food, but the earliest neurological symptoms may in some cases start abruptly. Here, we report the cases of two patients with food-borne botulism who were admitted to the neurological emergency room as candidates for intravenous thrombolysis for @di$ acute stroke @/di$.	1
Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal, albeit preventable and curable, illness caused by the exotoxin of @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$. Outbreaks of poisoning are most often caused by ingested bacteria contained in home-preserved products rather than by commercially canned products. Clinical findings usually appear within 12 to 36 hours of the ingestion of the tainted food. Anorexia, nausea, and @di$ vomiting @/di$ (77.4%); abdominal pain (54.8%); and blurred vision and diplopia (48.4%) are the most common clinical manifestations.	1
Brain abscesses are frequently caused by the continuous spread of concomitant infection areas (e.g., the middle ears, mastoids, and sinuses), and the most common clinical manifestations are headache and fever, which can cause @di$ shock @/di$ in severe cases. The most frequent sources of infection in brain abscesses are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. In recent years, some studies have demonstrated other sources of infection, including anaerobes, Gram-negative bacilli, oral @gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$, associated Actinobacillus, bacillus, clostridium, and fungi.	1
Brucellosis causes direct production losses resulting from abortions, stillbirths, infertility, the mortality of calves/kids/lambs, longer calving intervals, reduced draught power, poor @di$ weight gain @/di$, and reduced milk production. The etiological agent of this disease is an intracellular gram-negative coccobacillus of the genus Brucella. The main Brucella spp. that affect livestock species include B. abortus (cattle, camels), B. melitensis (sheep, goats), B. suis (pigs), and @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ (sheep).	1
Brucellosis in wild swine is typically caused by @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ although B. abortus and B. melitensis are also reported to cause mild disease. @gm$ B. suis biovar @/gm$ 1 has been detected in populations of collared peccaries in Venezuela and wild boars in Croatia. In these populations, few animals develop disease but the populations are considered an important reservoir for @di$ infection @/di$.	1
Brucellosis is a @di$ febrile illness @/di$, sometimes with localized bone and tissue infection, or multi-organ disease. Transmission to humans occurs through different routes: the ingestion of unpasteurized milk and dairy products; direct contact with infected animal tissues; or accidental ingestion, inhalation or injection of cultured Brucella. Most human Brucellosis cases occur in Syria, Turkey, Mexico and Iran, but also around the Mediterranean basin (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, North Africa). Brucella comprises six classical species (B. abortus, B. canis, B. melitensis, B. neotomae, B. ovis, and @gm$ B. suis @/gm$) and five novel species (B.	1

Brucellosis is a severe zoonotic infectious disease caused by the infection of the @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, which is widespread and causes considerable economic losses in underdeveloped areas. @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ is a facultative intracellular bacteria whose main target cells for infection are macrophages, placental trophoblast cells and dendritic cells. The main clinical signs of Brucella infection in livestock are @di$ reproductive disorders @/di$ and abortion. At present, the pathogenesis of placentitis or abortion caused by @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ in livestock is not fully understood, and further research on the effect of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ on placental development is still necessary. This review will mainly introduce the research progress of Brucella infection of placental trophoblast cells as well as the inflammatory response caused by it, explaining the molecular regulation mechanism of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ leading to @di$ reproductive system disorders @/di$ and abortion, and also to provide the scientific basis for revealing the pathogenesis and infection mechanism of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$.	1
Brucellosis is an important global @di$ zoonotic @/di$ disease caused by members of the Brucella genus. Members of this genus exhibit distinct primary host specificity and currently comprise ten species: B. melitensis, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$, B.	1
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a subgroup within the @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$ genus consisting of 20 species and is known to be opportunistic and causative of severe lower respiratory infections in patients with @di$ CF @/di$. Recurrent or chronic Bcc infections result in a decline of pulmonary function, frequent exacerbations, and high rates of mortality. Bcc-infected patients are often excluded from the option of lung transplantation. @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$ species grow in the mucus of the @di$ CF @/di$ lung, develop biofilms, and often appear later in the progression of @di$ CF @/di$. Viscous pulmonary mucus and thick biofilms impede antibiotic penetration in the @di$ CF @/di$ airway and reduce antibiotic treatment efficacy. Though breakthrough treatments have added years to the lives of people with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$, increased incidence of Bcc infection, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary hypertension have emerged as a consequence of longevity. The development of new approaches that target biofilm infections, including large molecule glycopolymer therapies, offers a unique opportunity to extend the life expectancy of @di$ CF @/di$ patients even further.	1
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a cutaneous disease caused by @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$. The presence of necrosis, which is accompanied by surprisingly little @di$ inflammation @/di$ or pain, is considered the most characteristic clinical presentation of BU disease. The macrolide exotoxin mycolactone, which is secreted by @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$, is thought to be the key virulence factor, playing the central role in the pathogenesis of BU.	1
But according to meta-analysis on @di$ obesity @/di$ adults' gut microbiota, the @di$ obesity @/di$ adults had enriched @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum; while lean adults had higher abundance of Bacteroides faecichinchillae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium bolteae, and Flavonifractor plautii. These bacteria are not the significantly different bacteria in our study, so we believe that BMI/@di$ obesity @/di$ is not the major cause of the identified metagenomic changes in this study.	0

Butyricicoccus porcorum has been associated with higher feed efficiency, as have Treponema porcinum and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$, which were also more relatively abundant in weaned pigs here. In-feed supplementation with Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum has been shown to improve health and feed efficiency in broiler chickens, and F. prausnitzii reduced intestinal permeability and cytokine expression in a mouse @di$ colitis @/di$ model.	2
By analyzing differential abundance, we observed that the upregulated species were Prevotella amnii and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while the downregulated species were Lactobacillus saerimneri and @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$ among UF patients. Prevotella amnii was reported to be enriched in patients with breast cancer, as it was involved in regulating or responding to host immunity and metabolic balance. Pseudomonas stutzeri is widely distributed in natural environments, and this species could be considered an opportunistic pathogen that is more abundant in bone and urinary tract infections, especially in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$ is associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase, an alcohol metabolism-related enzyme, and this species has the potential to be a promising dietary supplement probiotic. Our finding was in line with previous research which suggested that Lactobacillus saerimneri had higher relative abundance in a healthy and younger population and was associated with potent @di$ tumor necrosis factor @/di$-inhibitory activity.	2
CD is an @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$, and specific pathogenic bacteria that potentially cause CD have been anchored, such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. In our data, there were 35 CD-enriched species and 130 CD-depleted species (Figure 5A), indicating CD might be mainly induced by the deficiency of beneficial strains. E. coli, Clostridium ramosum, and Leptotrichia buccalis might be the main contributors in CD-enriched group, while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus sp. 5_1_39BFAA, Dorea formicigenerans, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Ruminococcus obeum might be the main contributors in CD-depleted groups.	2
CFE led to a dose-dependent increase in Roseburia, @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, and Bacteroides eggerthii. There was a shift in production of short-chain fatty acids, where acetate production increased on CFE, while butyrate decreased. In @di$ overweight @/di$ and obesity, acetate has been shown to increase fat oxidation when produced in the distal gut, and stimulate secretion of appetite-suppressive neuropeptides.	2

CLMEE presented better antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria with best results for @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ (MIC = 3.125 mg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC = 25 mg/mL) and M. luteus (MIC = 0.097 mg/mL and MMC = 12.5 mg/mL). Against S. aureus strain, the best bacteriostatic action was the CLCLE (MIC = 1.125 mg/mL) and, for this reason, we use F16 fraction purified C. leptophloeos hinokinin to evaluate the action of this lignan against @di$ MRSA @/di$ strains (Table 5). C. leptophloeos also showed antifungal activity, such as Aspergillus sp. (MIC values ranged from 3.125 to 6.25 mg/mL) and C. albicans (MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL, p-value < 0.05) showed in Table 3. The antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria were showed in Table 4. CLCHE showed better bacteriostatic effect against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL) and K. pneumoniae (MIC and MMC = MMC 12.5 mg/mL), CLAEE showed the better activity against E. coli (MIC and MMC = 12.5 mg/mL), and CLCLE was tested against Mycobacterium, indicating M. smegmatis (MIC = 12.5 mg/mL) to be more susceptible to CLCLE than M. tuberculosis (MIC = 52 mg/mL), Table 4. The MIC values of hinokinin (obtained from the purification F16 from CLCLE) ranged from 0.0485 to 3.125 mg/mL (p-value = 0.002) for the different S. aureus clinical isolates tested, and showed a bactericidal activity against @di$ MRSA @/di$ isolated from blood (MMC 0.40 mg/mL) and postoperative secretion (MMC = 3.125 mg/mL) showed in Table 5.	2
CONCLUSION: Since every 1% reduction in serum cholesterol concentration is associated with an estimated 2% to 3% reduction in risk for @di$ coronary heart disease @/di$, regular intake of FM containing an appropriate strain of @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ has the potential of reducing risk for @di$ coronary heart disease @/di$ by 6 to 10%.	2
Candidates include Clostridia clusters IV, XIVa and XVIII, @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides uniformis, the effects of which have been evaluated in preclinical trials with promising results for inflammatory and diet@di$ -related disorders @/di$.	2
Certain microbial toxins ADP-ribosylate G proteins that may be related to those postulated to participate in secretion, whilst botulinum neurotoxins, produced by @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, block Ca2(+)-dependent neurotransmitter release. Thus, botulinum, @di$ pertussis @/di$ and cholera toxins were examined for ADP-ribosyl transferase activity using isolated nerve terminals.	0
Certain taxa were associated with decreased weight or growth (including Actinomyces odontolyticus and Prevotella melaninogenica) or increased growth (such as @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ and Corynebacterium matruchotii) across anthropometric measures. Further exploration of the functional significance of this relationship will enhance our understanding of the intersection between @di$ weight gain @/di$, microbiota, and energy metabolism and the potential role of these relationships on the onset of obesity-associated diseases in later life.	1
Cff isolation was achieved in four cases (3 fetuses and the placenta), and detection of @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ was successful in all 5 cases by qPCR. Additionally, @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ was identified by DFAT in imprints of lung, liver and/or abomasal fluid smears in 3/4 fetuses (the case consisting of placenta only was not processed by DFAT). The pathologic examination of the fetuses revealed severe multifocal necrotizing and suppurative hepatitis (4 cases), mild lymphocytic myositis (2 cases), severe extensive suppurative bronchopneumonia, mild lymphocytic myocarditis, neutrophilic and histiocytic meningitis, neutrophilic and fibrinous splenitis, neutrophilic enterocolitis and abomasitis with fibrinosuppurative @di$ peritonitis @/di$ and microthrombosis of mesenteric vessels, and neutrophilic and histiocytic mesenteric lymphadenitis (1 case each).	1
Changes in the microbiota composition have also been associated to several diseases, such as chronic inflammation of the GIT, @di$ diabetes @/di$ and obesity, and the oral administration of members of the microbiota has been considered as a potential clinical tool to relieve intestinal dysfunctions. Interest in the beneficial functions of the human microbiota has resulted in the selection of specific strains with putative health-promoting capacities that are recognized as probiotics and are generally selected from isolates of the Lactobacillus or @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species. Probiotic bacteria have been shown capable to modulate systemic inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and such properties proposed as useful for future immunomodulatory and cancer prevention strategies. In vitro studies have reported the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp.	2
Charts were reviewed for all patients with at least one blood culture positive for @gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex accompanied by two or more of the following symptoms and signs of infection: fever, hypothermia, tachypnea, @di$ tachycardia @/di$, leukocytosis, or leukopenia.	1
Children are mostly infected with @gm$ YE @/gm$ serotype O:3, whereas adults are most commonly infected with serotype O:9. Pharyngitis can be present along with gastroenteritis in adults. It causes infections mostly in infants and young children. Infections in them are associated with cross-contamination of their food while handling pork products. It can mimic appendicitis with fever, tenderness, and right lower abdominal pain with leukocytosis in teenagers and young adults. Symptoms of pseudoappendicitis have often led to unnecessary appendectomies. In one study from Ireland, it was estimated (based on serologic testing) that up to 4% of patients undergoing appendectomies had acute YE infections. At the time of surgery, such patients tend to have enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (mesenteric adenitis) with a normal or slightly inflamed appendix. YE may be cultured from involved lymph nodes and the distal ileum. The risk of invasive disease increases in persons with chronic illnesses or immunosuppressive diseases, conditions that predispose to iron overload like thalassemia and @di$ hemochromatosis @/di$, therapy with deferoxamine, and transfusion-associated infections; these patients can present with septic shock in the setting of YE infections. The fatality rate among persons with transfusion-associated sepsis is high. It can cause extraintestinal manifestations like pharyngitis, soft tissue infection, osteoarticular infections, myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and suppurative lymphadenitis. Post-infectious sequelae are caused by cross-reactivity with the bacterial antigen, mostly in HLA-B27-positive persons. Reactive arthritis due to @gm$ YE @/gm$ tends to affect multiple larger joints.	1
Children who were born to HIV-negative mothers, who were non-@di$ stunted @/di$ at 18 months (LAZ > -2) and had at least 2 stool samples collected were used as a 'healthy training set' (n = 265 samples and 97 infants), which was then used to predict child age in a 'healthy test set' (n = 66 samples and 66 infants) and an 'unhealthy test set' (n = 528 samples and 169 infants). Using species composition, the microbiome was highly predictive of child age (Model pseudo-R2 = 0.77, Mean Absolute Error [MAE] = 1.4 months). This 'microbiota age' score was also strongly correlated with chronological age in the independent subset of children from the 'healthy' test set who were also non-@di$ stunted @/di$ and born to HIV-negative mothers (pseudo-R2 = 0.65). The species most strongly predictive of age included Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Blautia wexlerae, Prevotella copri, Staphylococcus hominis, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Bifidobacterium longum, Agathobaculum butyriciproducens, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Streptococcus vestibularis and Veillonella parvula (Fig. 1c). Metagenomic pathways also predicted age with high accuracy (Model pseudo-R2 = 0.68; MAE = 1.5; Fig. 1d). The pathways most strongly predictive of age included methanogenesis from acetate (METH-ACETATE-PWY), multiple nucleotide and amino acid metabolic pathways, including L-tryptophan biosynthesis (TRPSYN-PWY), purine ribonucleosides degradation (PWY0-1296), pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis I (PWY-7184), L-histidine degradation I (HISDEG-PWY), dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis I (DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY), flavin biosynthesis I (RIBOSYN2-PWY) and nitrate reduction I (DENITRIFICATION-PWY). This 'metagenome age' was also correlated with age in the independent subset of children from the 'healthy' test set who were also non-@di$ stunted @/di$ and born to HIV-negative mothers (pseudo-R2 = 0.56).	0
Chlamydia and @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ are recognized causes of atypical @di$ pneumonia @/di$. A case of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ due to Chlamydia psittaci/TWAR and @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$ following renal transplantation is described. Legionella bozemanii infection was diagnosed by a rise in antibodies and by isolation of the organism from bronchoscopy specimens. It is unusual to find @di$ pneumonia @/di$ caused concomitantly by two such agents. This case, despite the fatal outcome, emphasises the necessity for a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis of atypical @di$ pneumonia @/di$, including culture for @gm$ Legionella @/gm$, especially in immunocompromised patients.	1
Chronic cough (more than 3 weeks) was the main clinical symptom observed (85%) that is associated with @di$ fever @/di$ in 57% of the patients (Table 1). Patients were excluded from the study because of unknown age (n=2, 0.4%) or missing culture result (n=29, 5,3%). Patients were excluded from assay specific sub-analyses because of missing smear microscopy result (n=3, 0,5%) and repeated indeterminate, invalid or error GeneXpert MTB/RIF  results (n=8, 1,5%) (Fig. 1 - Clinical samples included in the fluorescence smear microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF  and Smear followed by Loopamp MTBC  Detection Kit  performance evaluation). A total of 201 (38.8%) samples were confirmed to be positive for @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ on LJ culture.	1
Chronic infection of the human gastric mucosa with @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ is a major cause of @di$ gastroduodenal pathologies @/di$, including @di$ peptic ulcerations @/di$, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ strains carrying the cag pathogenicity island, which encodes an active type IV protein secretion system (cag+ or type I strains), are preferentially associated with strong gastric inflammation and severe disease. We show here that cag+ @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ strains use the type IV secretion system to inject the bacterial protein CagA into various types of professional phagocytes, including human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and the human and murine macrophage cell lines THP-1 and J774A.1 CagA is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated and proteolytically processed to generate a stable 35-45 kDa C-terminally tyrosine-phosphorylated protein fragment. @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ was efficiently ingested by the different types of phagocytic cells. A chromosomal deletion of the complete pathogenicity island had no significant effect on the rate of ingestion. Furthermore, the survival rate of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ in the phagosome was unchanged between the wild type and a deletion mutant lacking the type IV secretion system.	1
Chronic recurrent or persisting @di$ ocular inflammation @/di$ was present in 15 of 19 patients (78.9%). The species isolated were @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$ in 14 patients (73.7%), M fortuitum in 3 patients (15.8%), M triplex in 1 patient (5.3%), and M avium intracellulare in 1 patient (5.3%). Antibiotic susceptibilities to tested isolates were the following: amikacin (14/16; 87.5%) and clarithromycin (12/16, 75.0%). Intravitreal injections of amikacin (0.4 mg/0.1 mL) were given in 14 of 19 patients (73.7%) with an average of 7 injections per patient (range, 1-24 injections). Intraocular lens removal was performed for 6 of 7 patients (85.7%) with post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis. All the patients with glaucoma implant (6/6, 100%) underwent implant removal. At last follow-up, 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) had best-corrected visual acuity of 20/400 or better. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis caused by nontuberculous @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ often included chronic recurrent or persistent @di$ intraocular inflammation @/di$ and frequently required removal of ocular device (intraocular lens, glaucoma implant, or scleral buckle).	1
Clinical effect: The effectiveness was 100% (excellent in 5 cases, good in 4 cases) in intrauterine infection, 75% in adnexitis (excellent in 1 case, good in 2 cases, poor in 1 case), 100% in pelveoperitonitis (excellent in 2 cases, good in 2 cases), 0% in parametritis (poor in 1 case) and 100% in @di$ Bartholin's abscess @/di$ (good in 2 cases), with the overall effectiveness rate of 90% (excellent in 8 cases, good in 10 cases, poor in 2 cases). Bacteriological effect: A total of 17 strains was isolated from 12 out of 20 cases. Fourteen out of 17 strains were aerobic organisms (7 of E. coli, 4 of Klebsiella, 2 of S. faecalis and 1 of S. epidermidis) and 3 out of 17 strains were anaerobes (each 1 strain of B. fragilis, @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$ and P.	0
Clinical signs of infection were @di$ orchitis @/di$ and epididymitis in males and lymphadenitis and placentitis with abortion in females. Gross pathologic findings included enlargement of the testes or epididymides, or both, and yellow caseous abscesses and pyogranulomas of the same. Brucella abortus biovar 4 was cultured in all bighorn sheep from a variety of tissues, including testes/epididymides, mammary gland, and lymph nodes. All bighorn sheep tested were positive on a variety of standard Brucella serologic tests. This is the first report of brucellosis caused by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ in Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep.	1
Clinical use of neurotoxins from @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$ is well established and is continuously expanding, including in treatment of pain conditions. Background: The serotype A (BoNT/A) has been widely investigated, and current data demonstrate that it induces analgesia and modulates nociceptive processing initiated by inflammation or nerve injury. Given that data concerning the serotype B (BoNT/B) are limited, the aim of the present study was to verify if also BoNT/B is able not only to counteract @di$ neuropathic pain @/di$, but also to interfere with inflammatory and regenerative processes associated with the nerve injury. Methods: As model of @di$ neuropathic pain @/di$, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve was performed in CD1 male mice. Mice were intraplantarly injected with saline (control) or BoNT/B (5 or 7.5 pg/mouse) into the injured hindpaw. For comparison, another mouse group was injected with BoNT/A (15 pg/mouse). Mechanical allodynia and functional recovery of the injured paw was followed for 101 days. Spinal cords and sciatic nerves were collected at day 7 for immunohistochemistry. Results and Conclusions: The results of this study show that BoNT/B is a powerful biological molecule that, similarly to BoNT/A, can reduce @di$ neuropathic pain @/di$ over a long period of time.	2
Cloacal swabs collected at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days postinoculation and caeca, liver, spleen, ovary, magnum, and isthmus tissues collected at necropsy at either 7 or 14 days were processed for @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolation (AS 5013.10-2009 from ISO6579:2002). Histopathology was performed on the above tissues, as well as lung, pancreas, kidney, heart, and additional intestinal and reproductive tract tissues. @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ was consistently detected in cloacal swabs between 7 and 14 days postchallenge. The Salmonella Enteritidis PT12 isolate successfully colonized the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen of all hens orally challenged with 107, 108, and 109 @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$, and less consistently colonized their reproductive tracts. On histopathology, mild lymphoid hyperplasia in the liver and spleen, along with hepatitis, typhlitis, serositis, and @di$ salpingitis @/di$, was observed at 7 and 14 days postchallenge, with a greater proportion of affected birds in the two higher dose groups. Diarrhea and culture of @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ from heart blood were not detected in challenged layers.	1
Clostridium XIVa, also known as @gm$ Clostridium coccoides @/gm$ group, is a group of microorganisms that help the host to use nutrients that cannot be properly digested. These bacteria are also known as good SCFAs producers, playing an important role in intestinal homeostasis. Shi et al. in observed an increase in these bacteria in the group of piglets supplemented with early food introduction (milk) that had an increase in SCFA production. SCFAs could contribute to the decrease of pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines reducing the proliferation of pathogens and contributing to the health of piglets (Table S4).	2
Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism, Haemophilus influenzae is a major cause of lower respiratory infections and @di$ meningitis @/di$ in children, Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia, and Yersinia pestis is the agent of plague.

Clostridium leptum was previously reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and a study reported that administration of a single strain of Clostridium butyricum resolved acute experimental @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice through induction of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Eubacterium (E. rectale, E. ventriosum, E. plexicaudatum) and Ruminococcus genera, which were both reported decreased in ulcerative colitis, were also decreased one week after antibiotic and chemotherapy administration and restored by transplantation. We observed a depletion of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum after antibiotic and chemotherapy administration. This depletion was still observed one week after chemotherapy discontinuation and restored after transplantation. Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum was recently reported to increase butyrate production and enhance intestinal epithelial barrier integrity in an in vitro model of Crohn's disease suggesting an anti-inflammatory action. In the same way, we observed a depletion of Roseburia producing bacteria (R. faecis, R. intestinalis and R. hominis) after antibiotics and chemotherapy. Such as Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum and Fecalibacterium prausnitzii, these species are supposed to reduce inflammation through butyrate production and are are reported dicreased in inflammatory bowel diseases. A recent study also demonstrated, that an increase of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ was associated with an increase in short chain fatty acids and reduced inflammation in a rodent @di$ colitis @/di$-associated colorectal cancer model.	2
Coagulase-negative @di$ catalase @/di$-positive cocci (CNCPC) play a very important role during the fermentation of sausages. In particular, they are involved in the aroma formation of the final product, because they release lipases that are able to free short-chain fatty acids that are contributing to the sensory characteristics of the fermented sausage. Few studies have been undertaken to elucidate the regulation of lipase gene expression in @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$ by substrate molecules or products of lipolysis.	0
Colonization of the vagina leading to ascending intrauterine infection is also a possibility, as evidenced by one case of @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ intrauterine infection and postpartum @di$ bacteremia @/di$ in a mother whose baby subsequently had @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ in his ear and throat swabs but remained asymptomatic. It is not known whether the mothers in our cases had @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ in their vagina or rectum, but regardless, they had a lower risk of ascending intrauterine infection in the absence of prolonged rupture of membranes.	1
Common bacterial isolates from feline and canine @di$ endocarditis @/di$ include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp.; Bartonella henselae is considered a common infectious agent in feline @di$ endocarditis @/di$; domestic cats and wild felids are considered its natural reservoir. @di$ Infectious endocarditis @/di$ is rare also in human medicine with an annual incidence rate of about 3-10 per 100,000 population, with Streptococcaceae being the most frequently identified microorganism. @di$ Enterococcal infectious endocarditis @/di$ has increased significantly in the past ten years. Several cases of @di$ endocarditis @/di$ caused by Salmonella typhimurium were described in human medicine. In veterinary medicine, a case of granulomatous myocarditis caused by Salmonella enterica subsup. arizonae was described in a Dumerili's boa (Acrantophis dumerili), but no cases of @di$ endocarditis @/di$ or myocarditis caused by Salmonella typhimurium have previously been described in cats. All Salmonella infections are considered zoonoses, except for Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, and @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$, which are human-specific diseases. At the time of the diagnosis the owner had not developed any clinical signs related to the disease; we do not have further data about his health condition. In our case, @di$ infectious endocarditis @/di$ was readily suspected on physical examination at presentation. The clinical examination showed a moderate grade III/VI left parasternal systolic murmur due to severe aortic outflow tract obstruction. The presence of a diastolic murmur at the left heart base, the onset of a new murmur, or a murmur that changes in intensity or characteristics have been considered classic clinical features of @di$ valvular endocarditis @/di$.	0
Compared to HCs, the most significant microbial change at the phylum level in the MGD meibum was the significantly decreasing abundance of Proteobacteria (log2 Fold Change = -4, adjusted P value = 2.8 x 10-15, Supplementary Table S4), which was also seen in the @di$ MGD @/di$ eyelid skin microbiome (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table S5). A comparison of the @di$ MGD @/di$ and HC groups shows that the top 10 genera whose abundance was not the same were present at higher levels in MGD meibum. These genera included Rubrobacter, Novibacillus, Campylobacter, Geobacillus, Sphingomonas, Corynebacterium, Sphingobium, Pedobacter, Fictibacillus, and Enterococcus (log2 Fold Change = approximately 3-14, adjusted P value < 1 x 10-6, Fig. 3E, see Supplementary Table S4). Among these genera, the same changes were observed in the top three and Corynebacterium in the eyelid skin microbiome, whereas a greater abundance of Geobacillus, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Pedobacter, Fictibacillus, and Enterococcus was specific to the microbiome of the MGD meibum. At the species level, the top 10 were Rubrobacter xylanophilus, Novibacillus thermophilus, Sphingomonas sp. SL9, @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$, Campylobacter jejuni, Sphingomonas panacis, Sphingomonas hengshuiensis, Rubrobacter radiotolerans, Sphingobium sp. SYK-6, and Sphingomonas wittichii, all of them were more abundant in @di$ MGD @/di$ samples (log2 Fold Change = approximately 5-14, adjusted P value < 1 x 10-9, see Supplementary Table S3). Among them, only Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 was more abundant in the MGD meibum, whereas the other nine species were also more preponderant in the microbiomes of the @di$ MGD @/di$ eyelid skin (Fig.	1
Compared with @di$ FGS @/di$-negative women, there was no evidence of a difference in the presence or concentration of cervicovaginal L. crispatus, L. iners, A. vaginae, @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, or C. albicans in participants with @di$ FGS @/di$ (Table 2). A higher proportion of participants with @di$ FGS @/di$ had T. vaginalis present, although there was not strong evidence of an association (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.92-4.86; P = .08) (Supplementary Table 1). This result was similar after adjusting for age (Supplementary Table 1). Otherwise, compared with @di$ FGS @/di$-negative women, the presence and concentration of other STIs were similar in women with @di$ FGS @/di$ (Table 2).	0
Compared with HTL, the HTE group had much higher levels of the @di$ hypertension @/di$-related bacteria genera Klebsiella and Streptococcus (+655% and +242%), while it had lower levels of SCFA-producing bacteria Bacteroides (-60%), Roseburia (-80%), Faecalibacterium (-50%), and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ (-79%), respectively. Table 3 further presents the significant difference between the groups in taxa at the genus and species level. The above results showed that the HTE experienced gut dysbiosis, while HTL were abundant in SCFA-producing bacteria. These results are consistent with the commonly reported @di$ hypertensive @/di$ gut genera in addition to identifying two new health-associated bacterial genera (Supplementary Table 6).	2
Compared with the Normal diet group, intestinal microbial dysbiosis in the Model group is characterized by increased expression of pathogenic bacteria (especially Bacteroides, @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$, and Butyrimionas) and positive correlation with pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ factor IL-6, as well as a decreased abundance of probiotics (such as Lactobacillus and Anaerotruncus).	1
Comparing the changes among cultures with WW, WSF and @di$ WIF @/di$, the population ratio of @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$ and Eubacterium hallii in the culture with WSF decreased to <1% (Fig. 2). @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$ and Eu. hallii have been reported to produce hydrogen (Duncan, Louis and Flint; Xu et al.) and a decrease in these species might be associated with the repression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The population of Cellulomonas flavigena gradually increased in the culture with @di$ WIF @/di$ and finally reached 1.4%. The population of Ce. flavigena was <0.2% and <0.1% in the cultures with WW and WSF, respectively. Cellulomonas flavigena could assimilate cellulose (Ponce-Noyola and Torre), and an increase in the population of Ce. flavigena observed in the culture with @di$ WIF @/di$ could be attributed to an increased ratio of crystalline cellulose in @di$ WIF @/di$. The population of Acetoanaerobium sticklandii increased significantly only in the culture with @di$ WIF @/di$ (up to 5.8%), whereas the population ranged from 0.1 to 0.9% in the culture with WW or WSF. Acetoanaerobium sticklandii is known to produce acetate (Sangavai and Chellapandi) and was inferred to contribute to acetate accumulation in the culture with @di$ WIF @/di$.	0
Comparing the presence of Bacteroides (enterotype 1), Prevotella (enterotype 2) and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ (enterotype 3) in the adolescents, frequencies of 47.6%, 49.6% and 3.3%, respectively, were recorded. In terms of enterotypes by sex, enterotype 1 was more frequent in the adolescent girls (Table 5) and in those adolescents whose families did not exhibit @di$ obesity @/di$ compared to those that did exhibit @di$ obesity @/di$ in their family members (X2 = 5.9, p = 0.0015). Applying these same two parameters to enterotype 2, this enterotype was found to be more frequent in the adolescent boys X2 = 7.901, p = 0.005 (Table 5), and in those adolescents whose family members exhibited @di$ obesity @/di$ X2 = 5.951, p = 0.015.	0
Comparison of the results of EIA with polysaccharide antigens of B.melaninogenicus, @gm$ B.asaccharolyticus @/gm$, F.nucleatum, P.intermedius, and Str.sanguis and the results of bacteriological detection of these bacteria in a closed pyoinflammatory focus in 283 patients with maxillofacial abscesses and @di$ phlegmons @/di$ brought the authors to a conclusion that the suggested EIA technique may be used to prove the contribution of these bacteria to the development of an inflammatory process in a patient.	1
Composite treatment of metformin and MOS demonstrated synergistic effects on ameliorating @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ and glucose tolerance, also on repairing islet and hepatic histology. In addition, MF+MOS altered the gut community composition and structure by decreasing the relative abundances of family Rikenellaceae and order Clostridiales while increasing an unnamed OTU05945 of family S24-7, Akkermansia muciniphila, and @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$.	2
Concisely, the milk samples were rotated at 6000 rpm for 10 min to concentrate the organism under hygienic procedures that decrease the danger of aerosol infection to the technicians, and the sediment (cream) was inoculated onto specific media (@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ Selective Agar) supplemented with antibiotic as formerly described, after that the cultured plates were examined for the growth of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ species on the fourth day and thereafter day-to-day for 2-4 weeks at 37 C in the presence or absence of CO2 (5-10%).The suspected colonies of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ were sub-cultured till appearance of typical round, glistening, pinpoint and honey drop-like appearance. Furthermore, 6 isolates of B. melitensis were collected from microbiological laboratories in a number of hospitals, which took precautions while extracting blood and serum samples from 70 febrile patients based on their history, which involved animal contact, unpasteurized milk consumption, and clinical signs for example fever, night sweetening, low back pain, and severe @di$ joint pains @/di$. Subsequent biochemical analysis of all @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ isolates were carried out with Vitek  2 Compact System.	1
Conjugal transfer of lox71 and lox66 targetron plasmids into @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ consistently yielded 10 to 20 transconjugant colonies, of which 80% to 100% contained the expected targetron insertion, indicating that the efficiency of delivery and integration of lox-containing targetrons is similar to that in previous targetrons studies in @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$. Following sequential delivery and curing of pQlox71R.2944 and pQlox66F.2993, PCR amplification of cphy2944 and cphy2993 showed targetron insertions in both genes (Fig. 2B), and sequencing of these PCR products established the presence of the expected genomic lox71 in cphy2944 (Fig. 2C) and lox66 in cphy2993 (Fig. 2D). We refer to this double insertion strain as @di$ DI-AS @/di$ (Table 1). Off-site targetron insertions are common, which would result in unexpected recombinations. Thus, we applied an inverse PCR assay using primers that anneal to the targetron in order to quantify the number and sequence of genomic targetron insertions. This assay confirmed that @di$ DI-AS @/di$ contains both expected genomic targetrons without any additional off-site insertions (Fig.	0
Consistent biomarkers associated with @di$ UMI @/di$ were identified by applying the same methodology. The resulting list included 4 Firmicutes, 2 Bacteroides, 2 Actinobacteria, and 1 Proteobacterium; the species were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Asaccharobacter celatus, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$, Dialister invisus, Firmicutes bacterium CAG 145, Oscillibacter sp CAG 241, and Proteobacteria bacterium CAG 139. However, only B. thetaiotaomicron was predictive of @di$ UMI @/di$ in 4 data sets (Frankel 2017, Gopalakrishnan 2018, Matson 2018, Davar 2021). The rest of the bacteria from this list showed consistent results in only two data sets. Concurrently, in the group 2 data sets, there were no consistent biomarkers of @di$ UMI @/di$ among the analyzed studies. Only P. copri displayed predictive power of @di$ UMI @/di$ in both Baruch 2021 and Davar 2021.	0
Consistent with the concept that microbial communities can regulate food sensitization, transfer of microbiota from sensitized mice with increased susceptibility to @di$ food allergy @/di$ (IL-4Ralpha gain-of-function mutation Il4Ra Y709F) confers @di$ food allergic @/di$ susceptibility when transferred into WT mice . Similarly, colonization of mice with intestinal microbiota from cow's milk-allergic infants, but not healthy infants, transferred @di$ food allergic @/di$ susceptibility . Conversely, the presence of the Clostridia species @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$ has been shown to confer protection to mice from food sensitization and anaphylaxis ,.	2
Contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) is a cause of severe lameness in sheep and the three Treponema phylogroups Treponema medium/@gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$-like, Treponema phagedenis-like and Treponema pedis have been associated with clinical disease. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe the histopathological changes associated with each previously established grade of clinical lesion, and (2) to investigate immunohistochemically the association of the @gm$ Treponema @/gm$-like organisms with the observed histopathological changes. Early lesions were characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the distal digital skin, with suppurative @di$ coronitis @/di$ and intracorneal pustules. In more advanced stages of the disease there was complete separation of the dorsal wall of the hoof with a necrotizing and fibrinosuppurative exudate and dermatitis. The later lesions were mostly resolved, but with milder suppurative changes remaining within the cornified layer and periosteal reaction of the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx. Large numbers of @gm$ Treponema @/gm$-like organisms were identified within early grade lesions (as well as later, more advanced grade lesions) and were specifically associated with the observed histopathological changes. The results of this study provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis that the three CODD-associated @gm$ Treponema @/gm$ phylogroups are involved in the aetiopathogenesis of this disease.	1
Conversely, @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$, shown to increase disease severity in collagen-induced @di$ arthritis @/di$ mice was associated with a higher MSSS in RRMS patients.	1
Correlation analysis using mWGS data showed that Collinsella aerofaciens (r=0 49, FDR=0 046), @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$ (r=0 62, FDR=0 016), Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens (r=0 63, FDR=0 016), Sutterella wadsworthensis (r=0 56, FDR=0 025) were positively correlated with the EDSS. Notably, Collinsella is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and is associated with increased gut permeability. Sutterella, a Gram-negative genus from Proteobacteria, has been associated with various diseases including @di$ autism @/di$ and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).	0
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are accompanied by @di$ seronegative arthritis @/di$ in about one fifth of the cases. In the present study, cell wall fragments from major residents such as @gm$ Eubacterium @/gm$, Coprococcus and Peptostreptococcus species, isolated from the faecal flora of patients with Crohn's disease, were tested for properties to induce @di$ chronic arthritis @/di$ in Lewis rats. Cell wall fragments from @gm$ Eubacterium contortum @/gm$ strains Me44 and Me47 were found to induce @di$ chronic arthritis @/di$; Peptostreptococcus productus strain C 18 cell wall fragments induced acute self-limiting @di$ arthritis @/di$. Coprococcus comes strain Me46 cell walls, on the other hand, were found to be lethal to the majority of rats inoculated, whereas those which survived did not develop acute @di$ or chronic arthritis @/di$.	1
Cultures of the pleural fluid under anaerobic conditions grew @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$, an organism normally found in the enteric flora. The infection developed in an old pleural effusion. Since there was no evidence of trauma, necrotizing @di$ pneumonitis @/di$ or subphrenic infection, spontaneous bacterial pleuritis is proposed.	1
Curiously, we found that the asd2-lysC-HGT was adjacent to BCAT in Midichloria but was adjacent to the lysine pathway gene dapA in PPN-type Wolbachia, matching the gene order of distantly related @gm$ Bacillus @/gm$ spp. and @di$ chlamydiae @/di$.	0
Current treatment options in patients with primary and secondary @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$ are limited and do not always lead to sufficient reduction in urinary oxalate excretion. Intestinal oxalate degrading bacteria are capable of degrading oxalate to CO(2) and formate, the latter being further metabolized and excreted via the feces. It is speculated, that both endogenously produced, as well as dietary oxalate can be significantly removed via the intestinal tract. Oxalobacter formigenes, an obligate anaerobic microbe normally found in the intestinal tract has one oxalate degrading enzyme, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, which is also found in Bifidobacterium lactis. Other bacteria with possible oxalate degrading potency are lactic acid bacteria, as well as Enterococcus faecalis and @gm$ Eubacterium lentum @/gm$. However, specific therapeutic studies on humans are scarce and, except for Oxalobacter, data are not congruent. We found the oral application of Oxalobacter successful in patients with primary @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$. However, long-term post-treatment follow-up of 1-2 years showed that constant intestinal colonization is not achieved in most patients. In one patient with constant colonization, urinary oxalate excretion normalized over time. Short-term studies with other bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria did not show a specific reduction in urinary oxalate excretion. O. formigenes might be a promising new therapeutic tool in patients with primary and secondary @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$.	2
Currently, one of the most problematic pathogens is @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$, accounting for about 2% of all healthcare-associated infections in USA and Europe and up to 4% in Asia. @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ is a member of the ESKAPE group of bacterial pathogens, also including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., which are major causes of antibiotic-resistant infections worldwide. It is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that is mainly responsible for causing @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and wound infections associated with elevated morbidity and mortality in clinical settings. The notable characteristics of @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ include the ability to rapidly acquire multidrug-, extensive drug-, and even pandrug-resistance phenotypes, as well as to easily survive and transfer in the hospital environment, such as attaching to various biotic and abiotic surfaces. @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ evolution during the past five decades was mainly driven by two globally disseminated clones, GC1 and GC2 (also called IC1 and IC2, IC standing for 'international clone').	1
Cutaneous mycobacterial infections may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, which are divided into four main disease categories: (i) cutaneous manifestations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, (ii) Buruli ulcer caused by @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ and other related slowly growing mycobacteria, (iii) leprosy caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis, and (iv) cutaneous infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Clinically, cutaneous mycobacterial infections present with widely different clinical presentations, including cellulitis, nonhealing ulcers, subacute or chronic nodular lesions, abscesses, superficial @di$ lymphadenitis @/di$, verrucous lesions, and other types of findings. Mycobacterial infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue are associated with important stigma, deformity, and disability. Geography-based environmental exposures influence the epidemiology of cutaneous mycobacterial infections. Cutaneous tuberculosis exhibits different clinical phenotypes acquired through different routes, including via extrinsic inoculation of the tuberculous bacilli and dissemination to the skin from other sites, or represents hypersensitivity reactions to M. tuberculosis infection. In many settings, leprosy remains an important cause of neurological impairment, deformity, limb loss, and stigma. Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a mycobacterial species related to M. leprae, is linked to diffuse lepromatous leprosy of Lucio and Latapi. @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ produces a mycolactone toxin that leads to subcutaneous tissue destruction and immunosuppression, resulting in deep ulcerations that often produce substantial disfigurement and disability. Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$, is an important cause of cutaneous sporotrichoid nodular lymphangitic lesions.	1
Cutibacterium (previously @gm$ Propionibacterium) acnes @/gm$ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive commensal of the human body. The bacterium has been associated with a variety of diseases, including acne vulgaris, prosthetic joint infections, prostate cancer, and @di$ sarcoidosis @/di$. The accumulation of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ in diseases such as acne and prostate cancer has been shown to correlate with enhanced inflammation. While the @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced proinflammatory axis, via NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling and inflammasome activation, has been investigated over the last few decades, the potential role of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ in triggering the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway has not been addressed. Our results show that @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ induces the IFN-I signaling axis in human macrophages by triggering the cGAS-STING pathway. In addition, IFN-I signaling induced by @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ strongly depends on the adapter protein TRIF in a non-canonical manner; these signaling events occurred in the absence of any detectable intracellular replication of the bacterium. Collectively, our results provide important insight into @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced intracellular signaling cascades in human macrophages and suggest IFN-I as a factor in the etiology of @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$-induced diseases. This knowledge may be valuable for developing novel therapies targeting @gm$ C. acnes @/gm$ in diseases where the accumulation of the bacterium leads to an inflammatory pathology.	1
DNA from a total of 68 individual bacterial species were detected in ST samples from the patients with @di$ ReA @/di$ and UA, and 12 DNAs from different bacteria were identified in the control ST samples. Additionally, DNAs from 20 bacterial species were detected in both study and control samples from patients with @di$ ReA @/di$, UA, RA, or OA. Therefore, these organisms are probably common in joint diseases (Table 4). Many sequences were from commensal bacteria, in particular those normally found in the skin or the intestinal tract (Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli and other coliform bacteria). We also detected bacterial DNAs from mucosal bacterial flora such as streptococci, Actinomycetes and Neisseria, and DNAs from opportunistic pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Alcaligenes faecalis, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Acinetobacter spp. in a number of samples. We found DNAs from organisms that are commonly identified as triggering @di$ ReA @/di$, such as Shigella flexneri and @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ , in 33.33% of @di$ ReA @/di$ and UA samples, but not in control samples. @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ DNA was detected in samples from one @di$ ReA @/di$ and one UA patient. S. flexneri DNA was detected in samples from two patients with @di$ ReA @/di$ and one with UA. DNA from Propionibacterium acnes - an arthritogenic agent involved in SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) syndrome, which is an oligoarthritis associated with acnes and pustilosis - was detected in @di$ ReA @/di$ and UA samples. Detection of this bacterium-derived DNA was associated with @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ (patient 3) and with S.	1
DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ promoted C. glabrata dissemination to the liver and kidneys (Fig. 1C). Regarding the microbiota diversity, cultures confirmed that the number of E. coli and E. faecalis colonies increased significantly from day 6 to day 14 in both the DSS and C. glabrata WT-DSS groups when compared to the C. glabrata WT or control groups, suggesting that irrespective of C. glabrata colonization, DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ promotes an increase in E. coli and E. faecalis populations in mice (Fig. 2A,C). In contrast to Bacteroides vulgatus populations, the number of B. thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides sp. TP5 decreased significantly in both DSS and C. glabrata WT-DSS mice (Fig. 2B,D and E). In terms of anaerobic bacteria, the number of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp., in particular @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$, and L. johnsonii colonies was significantly reduced in both DSS and C. glabrata WT-DSS mice, but the reduction in the L. johnsonii population was significantly more pronounced in the C. glabrata WT-DSS group, suggesting that overgrowth of C. glabrata impacts on the L. johnsonii population during the development of @di$ colitis @/di$ (Fig. 2F and G). In contrast, the Lactobacillus reuteri population revealed unpredictable changes and significant fluctuations over the course of DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ suggesting no association between C.	2
DeSeq2 differential abundance analysis revealed statistically significant differences in log2 fold change abundance between @di$ CeD @/di$ and non-@di$ CeD @/di$ samples. Log2 fold change > 0 and < 0 indicate increased abundance in children with @di$ CeD @/di$ and non-@di$ CeD @/di$ respectively. Increased abundance in children with non-@di$ CeD @/di$ suggests decreased abundance in children with @di$ CeD. @/di$ Table 2 shows the log2 abundance change for the top 10 taxa (order, family, and genera) in mucosal and fecal samples, illustrating the different microbiota profile between mucosa and stool. For example, in mucosal samples, Flavobacteriales (p = 0.0005), Flavobacteriaceae (unadjusted p = 8.11-08), and Clostridium (unadjusted p = 0.011), were the most significantly decreased bacterial order, family, and genus levels respectively, whereas Micrococcales (unadjusted p = 0.018), Micrococcaceae (unadjusted p = 0.022), and Subdoligranulum (unadjusted p = 0.021) were the most significantly abundant bacterial order, family and genus levels respectively. In fecal samples, however, Cardiobacteriales (p = 0.01), Leuconostocaceae (p = 0.003), and Tannerella (p = 1.17-05) were the most significantly decreased bacterial order, family and genus levels respectively, whereas Planctomycetaceae (p = 0.013) and Kocuria (p = 0.003) were the most abundant family and genera levels. The top 10 most significant species abundance in mucosal samples is presented in Table 3. In these samples, @gm$ Bifidobacterium angulatum @/gm$ (unadjusted p = 0.006) and Roseburia intestinalis (unadjusted p = 0.031), were examples of increased species in mucosal samples of children with @di$ CeD @/di$ and non-@di$ CeD @/di$ (decreased in @di$ CeD @/di$) respectively.	2
Definitive MTB was established on the basis of histological findings of @di$ caseating granuloma @/di$ and/or detection of @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ bacillus antigens in multiple (at least two) organs by a biopsy, surgery, or autopsy. Clinical MTB was diagnosed based on a histological confirmation of tuberculosis infections in bone marrow specimens and/or other organs by a biopsy, surgery, or autopsy. The PCR- and/or culture-confirmed but not pathologically confirmed patients were excluded from the category of clinical MTB. In bone marrow specimens, findings of @di$ caseating granuloma @/di$ and/or @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ were recognized as indicative of tuberculosis infection in accordance with a previous report.	1
Demographic and clinical features were compared in patients with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ pneumonia and patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (Table 1). Patients with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ pneumonia had higher axillary temperature at hospital admission (95% CI of mean difference, 0.5-0.9  C) and were younger (95% CI of mean difference, 6.1-10.2 yr). By contrast, patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were more likely to have comorbidities, mainly chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic cognitive deficit. Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia had more frequently received prior seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. Conversely, alcohol abuse and current/former smoking were more common in patients with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ pneumonia. Significantly, patients with @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ pneumonia more frequently had received prior outpatient beta-lactam treatment (medication was administered from symptoms onset to hospitalization) and had a history of previous travel. Regarding clinical features, patients with L. pneumophila pneumonia were less likely to have cough, purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain, pleural effusion, and septic shock at hospital admission. Conversely, they more commonly had headache, arthralgia/@di$ myalgia @/di$, hyponatremia, and multilobar pneumonia, and had higher transaminase values.	0
Dermatological manifestations in patients with CGD include atopic dermatitis-like disease but with systemic or deep seated @di$ infections @/di$, facial granulomata and discoid lupus, and seborrheic dermatitis-like disease. Vesicular and granulomatous of fungal skin lesions have been observed in small reports. Altered skin Rebuck window responses in patients with CGD have been recorded. Several skeletal complications related mainly to @di$ infections @/di$ have been described in patients with CGD. Osteomyelitis secondary to invasive Aspergillus or @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$  may occur.	1
Dermatologically relevant nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) include Mycobacterium marinum and @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ and different rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). RGM are widely present in the environment and are facultative pathogenic. Diagnostic detection of nontuberculous mycobacteria is frequently challenging. Immune-competent individuals mostly develop localized infections. Immune-suppressed patients may present with severe and disseminated disease. In these cases, rapid initiation of medical treatment is important. Moreover, infections with the more aggressive @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ should be treated early. Due to the risk for the development of inducible antibiotic resistance, antibiotic regimes for @di$ NTM infections @/di$ typically require at least two drugs.	1
Despite its known lack of identifiable virulence properties, @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ was the most prevalent species, accounting for 69% of the isolates. None of the @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ strains produced cytotoxin by the 51Cr release assay and 12.5% were weakly enterotoxigenic by the infant mouse assay. All of the Aeromonas sobria and 71% of Aeromonas hydrophila were positive for both toxins. Ninety-two percent of the children with Aeromonas-associated diarrhea were younger than 3 years; 84% of the cases were seen between May and October. The majority of the children had an acute onset of watery diarrhea. Fever and vomiting were most commonly associated with the isolation of A. sobria. Eight children had chronic or intermittent diarrhea lasting for weeks to months before consultation; @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ was the isolate in all these cases. Several complications possibly related to Aeromonas intestinal infection were observed. These included Gram-negative bacteremia, intussusception, internal hernia strangulation, hemolytic uremic syndrome and @di$ failure to thrive @/di$ in patients with chronic diarrhea.	1
Despite these limitations, shotgun metagenomics revealed that patients with PAH have a higher relative abundance of several species that are generally proinflammatory, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$, and Bacteroides vulgatus, than healthy control subjects and lower relative abundance of some species with antiinflammatory properties than healthy control subjects (e.g., Butyrivibrio sp. and Bifidobacterium angulatum). Furthermore, linear regression analysis between the Shannon diversity index and the patients' hemodynamics data identified an association between @di$ gut dysbiosis @/di$ and the development of pulmonary vascular disease but not right ventricular malfunction.	1
Detailed cases of intrathoracic and respiratory infections with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ are shown in Table 4. Boattini et al (2016) reported in a retrospective analysis 6 cases of pneumonia due to @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. Previous cases of pneumonia or pleural effusions, both community- and hospital-acquired, have also been reported. Seng et al (2016) further described 1 and 2 cases of hospital-acquired pericarditis and mediastinitis respectively. Sener et al (2011) published a case of fever of unknown origin in a 16-month-old female patient presenting as fever and @di$ persistent cough @/di$, in whom @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Previous detailed cases depict patients with postoperative infections or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe systemic alterations. The presence of respiratory infections with @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ in the community seems to be extremely uncommon especially in healthy immunocompetent individuals.	1
Detection of @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ or ESBL positive cultures was not related to any complication. However, detection of @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ did affect length of hospital stay (10.5 days, P=0.042). Organisms with resistance to gentamycin (P=0.026) and TMP/SMX (P=0.002) were significantly correlated with organ/space SSI. Organisms with resistance to gentamycin were related to longer length of hospital stay (11.5 days, P=0.049). No specific organism or antibiotic resistance was related to @di$ ileus @/di$ or gastroenteritis.	0
Diabetes easily causes bacteria to enter other tissues and organs and secretes gelatinase due to its low immunity Cytolysin and other virulence factors invade, destroy host tissue cells, and tolerate the host's non-specific immune response, increasing the risk of infection of the host's @di$ abdominal cavity infection @/di$, blood sepsis, endocarditis, and other infectious diseases. The abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was relatively low in HFD gut flora. It was added after intervening with probiotic-fermented rice-buckwheat and monascus-fermented buckwheat. The relative abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was consistent with this research; however, the high-dose group of KBF decreased because of the increase of other dominant bacteria, thus inhibiting the decrease of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$.	0
Dichapetalum madagascariense Poir (Dichapetalaceae) is traditionally used to treat bacterial infections, jaundice, urethritis and @di$ viral hepatitis @/di$ in Africa. Its root contains a broad spectrum of biologically active dichapetalins. To evaluate the plant's effect on human MCF-7 cells and its' antibacterial and antiparasitic potentials, we isolated and identified the known dichapetalins A and M from the roots. Both dichapetalins were tested on six bacterial strains (Shigella flexneri, Bacillus cereus, @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi B @/gm$, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) and two parasite strains; Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and Leishmania donovani using the Alamar Blue assay system.	0
Dietary EA supplementation significantly increased the average daily weight gain (ADG) and reduced @di$ diarrhea @/di$ rate and serum diamine oxidase (DAO) levels of weaned piglets. Transcriptome sequencing results revealed 401 differentially expressed genes in the jejunum mucosal tissue of pigs in the control and test groups. Of these, 163 genes were up-regulated and 238 were down-regulated. The down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in 10 pathways (false discovery rate < 0.05), including seven pathways related to immune response. The results of bacterial 16s rDNA sequencing show that EA affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the cecum and rectum, and reveal significant differences in the abundances of Prevotella_9, @gm$ Lactobacillus delbrueckii @/gm$, and Lactobacillus reuteri between the test and control groups (P < 0.05).	2
Dietary berberine also increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria including @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, L. johnsonii, and P. distasonis, as shown in the present study. @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ improves gut mucosal immune response and inhibits food allergy in mice. L. johnsonii can promote growth, gut development, and intestinal microorganisms in pig, mice, and chicken, when used as a probiotic. The abundance of P. distasonis was negatively correlated with @di$ obesity @/di$, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and other disease states, suggesting that it possibly plays a positive regulatory role in glucose and lipid metabolism.	2
Dietary supplementation of sausages with powder of dried anthocyanine-rich berries reduced the number of @di$ intestinal tumors @/di$ induced by azoxymethane treatment in rats, and alleviated the presence of pro-inflammatory @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ in their microflora.	2
Difference of the severity of three @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients who have the newly isolated archaea and that of the patients who have @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ was also evaluated.	0
Differential abundance testing between R and NR for the @di$ melanoma @/di$ subset yielded 17 differentially abundant species (P < 0.05, unadjusted, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, Supplemental Table 1). Hierarchical clustering of patients using only the differentially abundant species revealed 2 clusters, one enriched in R and the other enriched with NR (Figure 2C, P = 0.0013, Fisher's exact test). Among the most abundant species, we observed that R patients were enriched in unknown Ruminococcaceae species, unknown Faecalibacterium species, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$, whereas NR patients were enriched in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Bifidobacterium dentium, and unknown Mogibacterium.	1
Differential expression of @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ flagellins in vitro has effects on IECs and BMDCs. The panel of flagellins tested affected IECs and BMDCs differently, although all the flagellin structures included the conserved Arg90 domain associated with flagellins that bind and activate TLR5, which suggests that other sequence/structural properties might account for the signaling responses mediated by FlaA1 and FlaA2. Certain commensal flagellin structures may help to direct immune tolerance responses through TLR5 expressed on either CD103+DC or Treg subsets. The significance of flagellin-TLR5 signaling in Treg responses induced by @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ was further investigated using TLR5KO mice. We showed that @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$-induced CD3+CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells were significantly lower in TLR5KO mice, indicating that TLR5/flagellin signaling is an important mediator for the expansion of this T cell subset. The immunomodulatory effects of @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ were shown in DSS-treated mice. Although the DSS model of @di$ colitis @/di$ is generally a T cell-independent model, we showed that @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$ induced regulatory T cell populations in these animals. Other anti-inflammatory molecules such as butyrate may also contribute to immune tolerance and limit tissue damage. Another effect of short-chain fatty acids produced by the bacterium is the improved food conversion efficiency. The dietary constituents such as polysaccharides that are poorly utilized by the host are degraded by the bacterium and used by the host resulting in a better energy recovery from the diet. Differential expression of satiety genes may be another factor contributing to the heavier weight and higher adiposity in @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$-colonized animals.	2
Direct subgingival administration of Chlorhexidine-gel also produced a remarkable modification in the proportions of putative periodontopathic microorganisms, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$, in subgingival bacterial plaque from @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients.	1
Disorder of the biological clock is closely related to diseases such as coronary heart disease, depression, @di$ Alzheimer's disease @/di$, diabetes, and hypertension. Different living habits can cause abnormalities in the body's biological clock, which can lead to diseases. Hence, we used couple control by collecting noninsomniac spouses of PI women as a control group to avoid the influence of diet and different biological clocks. Statistical analysis was performed on all samples in the control and model group. We observed that there were abnormal compositions of @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, Blautia obeum, Ruminococcus, Prevotella copri, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides, and fecal Bacteroidetes between the control and model groups. Previous studies showed that the abnormality of flora was closely related to numerous diseases. Wang et al. found that abnormal content of Ruminococcus, Blautia obeum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, etc. is closely related to coronary heart disease. Gao et al. found that the proportion of Blautia obeum, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella copri, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, and Ruminococcus in the intestine of patients with colon cancer decreased in varying degrees (P < 0.05). Suhana et al. tested the skin swabs and stool samples of 13 patients and found that lichen sclerosus may be associated with abnormal levels of @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$ and Ruminococcus. We further studied whether the effect of TWBXG was achieved by regulating the disordered intestinal flora by treating 13 insomniac patients with TWBXG for 4 weeks. After treatment, the proportions of @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, Blautia obeum, Ruminococcus, Prevotella copri, and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans were decreased, while those of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides, fecal Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus were increased.	1

Distinct from previous reviews of the topic, we have presented two separate measures of burden; both incidence and proportion of @di$ enteric fever @/di$ attributable to paratyphoid A. Available data are limited but suggest that S. Paratyphi A accounts for a substantial proportion of @di$ enteric fever @/di$ cases in some areas, although there appears to be significant geographic variability in incidence. The lack of systematic surveillance for S. Paratyphi A makes reliable estimation of burden difficult. Given the reported incidence and proportion of @di$ enteric fever @/di$ cases attributable to S. Paratyphi A, increased attention to this disease is warranted, particularly as @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ vaccine coverage increases.	0
Diversified microbiota contributes to the development of dental caries, @di$ gingivitis @/di$, and periodontitis. @di$ Gingivitis @/di$ is the inflammation of the soft tissues of the gum surrounding the teeth that develops due to interaction between the plaque microbiota and the host tissues. The level of gram-positive Streptococci and gram-negative anaerobes such as Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Campylobacter, Eikenella, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella are elevated in gingival plaque. High prevalence of L buccalis was reported in Chinese patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$ and necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. Prevotella subspecies, Lactobacillus subspecies, Dialister subspecies, and Filifactor subspecies are related to pathogenesis and progression of dental caries. The genera Veillonella, Bifidobacterium, Selenomonas, Olsenella, Parascardovia, Scardovia, Chryseobacterium, Terrimonas, Burkholderia, Neisseria, and Sporobacter showed significantly higher abundance in patients with dental caries. Veillonella has cariogenic potential and allows acidogenic bacteria such as @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ species to grow and continue to produce additional acid.	1
Donors were excluded if they reported antibiotic use within the preceding 3 months, actively smoked, were obese with body mass index (BMI) >30, had history of incarceration, tattoo or body piercing within the preceding 3 months, used illicit drugs, engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, traveled within 6 months to areas with endemic diarrheal illnesses, were currently infected with any communicable disease, had known chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease including diarrhea, @di$ constipation @/di$, IBD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), GI malignancy or polyposis, liver disease, and for other conditions including chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, chronic pain syndrome, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, immunodeficiency, allergies or atopy. Prospective donors underwent laboratory testing including complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serological testing for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, and rotavirus. Donor stools were screened for enteropathogens including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, Campylobacter spp., ova, cysts and parasites, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Isospora.	0
Dublin SD3246 causes @di$ systemic typhoid-like disease @/di$ and persists in the liver; the avian pathogen S. Gallinarum SG9 can effectively invade the bovine gut but is avirulent in calves; and the generalist S. Typhimurium ST4/74, which causes acute enteritis in calves, can replicate rapidly and be more invasive than SD3246 in the bovine gut. The enhanced replication of ST4/74 compared to host-adapted @gm$ S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ has been observed in porcine intestines as well.	1
Due to food conditions, fairly close contact with livestock or companion animals, and indirect contact with humans, the peregrine falcon may be exposed to human pathogenic microorganisms, including @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp., Salmonella, E. coli or Mycoplasma. Due to close contact with rapidly developing urban environments, peregrine falcons can also be exposed to toxic elements such as cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb), which can affect their health status, welfare, and immunity, with increased susceptibility to @di$ infection @/di$.	1
During 1985-1994 twenty-one sporadic cases, mostly @di$ pneumonias @/di$, could be diagnosed. As etiologic agents L. pneumophila 4, 12, 3, 2 and 1 besides legionella-like organisms @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ and less often L.	1
During 1999, we used partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the prospective identification of atypical nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients attending our @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ center. Of 1,093 isolates of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli recovered from 148 patients, 46 (4.2%) gave problematic results with conventional phenotypic tests. These 46 isolates were genotypically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 isolates, 12 patients), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (10 isolates, 8 patients), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9 isolates, 9 patients), Burkholderia cepacia genomovar I/III (3 isolates, 3 patients), Burkholderia vietnamiensis (1 isolate), @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ (1 isolate), and Ralstonia mannitolilytica (3 isolates, 2 patients), a recently recognized species.	1
During @di$ dysbiosis @/di$, a number of polymicrobial synergies occur. In the subgingival plaques, more than 700 bacterial taxa have been detected. Multiple species and genes may be involved in these synergies. Endo et al. reported that essential genes involved in butyric acid metabolism within the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are complemented in P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$. The composition of the microbiomes of several body areas, including supragingival plaque, buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum, showed diversity among subjects at the phylum level; however, the functional genes in this metabolic pathway were similar among all subjects. These reports indicate the necessity of functional gene analysis. In addition, differences in the virulence within each species have been reported. The virulence of P. gingivalis with type II fimbriae was reportedly higher than that of the same species that produce other types of fimbriae. A variant of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, another major pathogen implicated in periodontitis, with mutations in its leukotoxin promoter region, produces significantly higher levels of leukotoxin than the original strain does. These reports indicate that metagenomic analyses of subgingival plaque are essential to clarify the mechanisms of interspecies synergy inducing @di$ dysbiosis @/di$.	1
During fermentation with whole cells of @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ or Clostridium microsporum the pro-3S hydrogen of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate or of its precursor (S)-glutamate is eliminated stereospecifically. Since (E)-glutaconate but not its Z isomer is fermented by whole cells or cell-free extracts of A. fermentans, the overall @di$ dehydration @/di$ of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate to (E)-glutaconate can be described as syn. 2. The fermentation of (E)-glutaconate required acetyl phophate, CoA and NAD, that of (S)-glutamate or (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate additionally MgCl2, FeSO4 and dithioerythritol. The fermentations of all three substrates were inhibited by avidin and stimulated by biotin. 3. The hydration of (E)-glutaconate was measured enzymically by the formation of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate. The @di$ dehydration @/di$ of the hydroxy acid was assayed by the release of 3HOH from (2R)-2-hydroxy[3-3H]glutarate. Optimum conditions were found by activation of the cell-free extract with MgCl2, FeSO4, dithioerythritol, acetyl phosphate anmd NADH followed by the reaction which only required acetyl phosphate and CoA as cofactors. Activation and reaction had to be performed anaerobically. 4. The @di$ dehydration @/di$ was inhibited by 2 mM azide, 1 mM arsenate, 1 mM hydroxylamine, 20 micro M dinitrophenol or 10 micro M carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. 5. It is concluded that the actual substrates of the @di$ dehydration @/di$ are the corresponding thiol esters.	0
During pregnancy, a rise in the level of progesterone and estrogens, as well as immunological changes, significantly remodel composition of the human vaginal microbiome toward stable, low richness and diversity community structures dominated by @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp., which provide greater resistance and a protective role against genital tract infections. Although dysbiosis (disruption of the vaginal microbiota) is asymptomatic in about 40% of affected women, it may predispose to a higher risk of urogenital conditions including aerobic vaginitis (AV) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). The latest was reported to increase the risk of @di$ PTD @/di$ ~5-fold.	1
During the third harvesting of sputum samples, a sample that was derived from the site of an active infection based on the data from the microscopic examination of the sputum, @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ was isolated along with L. amnigena, both of which are strains of low-virulence species and maintain susceptibility to antibiotics. In the context of an immunosuppressed patient with previous pulmonary surgery for actinomycosis, @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$, and bronchiectasis, all these conditions are favorable for biofilm formation.	1
Dutch Belted rabbits orally infected with 5-9 x 108 CFU of host-adapted EHEC O103 (Stx1+ Stx2-) or patient-derived @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ (Stx1+ Stx2+) developed renal vascular lesions and glomerular lesions containing erythrocyte fragments. These animals also demonstrated diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration and weight loss with a low hematocrit observed in five of six infected animals. Similar to that seen in humans, glomerular, perivascular and tubular injury was observed in all animals after challenge with either strain, as was glomerular endothelial edema, mesangial deposits and fibrin thrombi occluding capillary lumens. Lack of changes in creatinine suggests renal injury rather than renal insufficiency, and although mild to moderate @di$ thrombocytopenia @/di$ was observed in only 3 of 30 experimental animals, glomerular thrombi and renal congestion suggest the presence of coagulopathy if not a full thrombotic microangiopathy. Intestinal edema and vascular lesions with colonic inflammation with leukocyte infiltration was observed, as was surface-adherent E. coli in the cecal mucosa and crypt lumens. This animal model is a reasonable mimic of the human renal and intestinal lesions induced by EHEC and its toxins, although lack of consistent @di$ thrombocytopenia @/di$ limits this model with respect to recapitulating human HUS.	1
Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, with the predominance of lipopolysaccharide-synthesizing bacteria, such as @gm$ Escherichia @/gm$/Shigella, could enhance intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation to the systemic circulation and worsening insulin resistance. In fact, the increased abundance of @gm$ Escherichia @/gm$/Shigella was positively correlated with the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CXCL2, NLRP3, and IL-1beta). Importantly, the presence of bacterial endotoxins has been demonstrated in typical @di$ senile plaque lesions @/di$ in Alzheimer disease brains. Thus, it seems contradictory that the enrichment of @gm$ Escherichia @/gm$/Shigella genera could have beneficial effects. A detailed mechanistic investigation suggests agmatine as an @gm$ E. coli @/gm$-produced metabolite necessary for the effects of metformin on host lipid metabolism and lifespan in both C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The study demonstrated a causal link between metformin supplementation and agmatine production by @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ to increase host lifespan, with the phosphotransferase system-Crp bacterial axis as a central regulator of the effects of metformin on the host. Metformin treatment was also associated with a predicted increase in agmatine production capacity by @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ and other Enterobacteriales in subjects with T2D.	1
EHEC infection causes toxin-mediated damage to the intestine and renal endothelial cells, resulting in hemolytic uremic syndrome and @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$. In 2019, more than half of the EHEC outbreaks in the USA were caused by romaine lettuce and ground beef. Many EHEC serotypes are known; however, the representative serotype is @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$, which is difficult to control in the food supply chain as this serotype can survive for a long time below 4  C and is very tolerant to acidic conditions. Heat processes can efficiently remove @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$; however, because these processes cannot be applied to heat-sensitive foods, alternatives such as chlorine gas, essential oil, and organic acid have been extensively studied and proposed. These alternatives are known to be very effective disinfectants for controlling @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$; however, they are associated with many drawbacks, such as high cost, negative effects on food sensory features, and technical difficulties in the food supply chain.	1
EOS is defined by bacteremia or @di$ meningitis @/di$ occurring in newborns less than 3-days old. EOS could be vertically transmitted infection that usually occurs as an ascending infection from the mother's cervix. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of EOS followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Listeria monocytogenes. Prematurity or low birth weight, birth asphyxia, prolonged rupture of membranes, and traumatic delivery are the major risk factors that contribute to the incidence of EOS. LOS is defined as sepsis in infants during 4-90 days of life and could be caused either by vertically or horizontally transmitted infections. The most important microorganisms involved in LOS include coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.	1
ETEC infection in newly weaned pigs contributes to the development of post-weaning @di$ diarrhoea @/di$, an economically significant disease characterised by @di$ diarrhoea @/di$, dehydration, stunted growth and significant mortality. The effects of the L. hyperborea and L. digitata extracts on representative beneficial bacterial strains, @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$, L. plantarum and L. reuteri, were also evaluated. These bacterial species commonly colonise the porcine gastrointestinal tract and exert a range of beneficial roles such as inhibition of intestinal pathogens, immunomodulation, improved composition in the gastrointestinal microbiota and enhanced health and growth. In the pure-culture growth assays, the E1 and E4 extraction conditions were predominantly associated with antibacterial and bifidogenic activities, respectively. LHE1 was the most potent extract in reducing S. typhimurium and ETEC counts. LDE1 also inhibited the growth of both pathogenic strains to a lesser extent. Additionally, LHE1 and LDE1 reduced @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ counts, whereas both extracts were also associated with a slight increase in L. reuteri counts. Interestingly, LDE4 followed by LHE4 increased @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ counts in a concentration-dependent manner, with LHE4 additionally stimulating the growth of L.	2
Earlier epidemiological evidence revealed a fourfold increase in @di$ obesity @/di$ risk is possible within 15 years of emigrating to the U.S. compared to populations remaining in their birth country. In a recent cross-sectional and longitudinal study of a multi-generational Asian American cohort, emigrating to the U.S. was shown to reduce gut microbial diversity and function. Alpha diversity was measured using the Shannon entropy, a quantitative index that accounts for the abundance and evenness of species residing in the host, as opposed to species richness, which is the number of species present. Within the gram-negative Bacteroidetes phylum, bacterial strains from the genus Prevotella, whose enzymes degrade plant fiber, became displaced by dominant strains from the genus @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ according to an individual's time spent in the U.S. The ratio of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ to Prevotella increased by factors of 10, correlating with the time in decades spent in the U.S. Prior to this study, metagenomics had identified three clusters of variation in the human gut, referred to as enterotypes. The first enterotype, high in @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and low in Prevotella, is found in individuals on a long-term Western diet high in animal protein, the nutrient choline, and saturated fat. The second enterotype is high in Prevotella, low in @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, and associated with a plant-based diet rich in fiber, simple sugars, and plant-derived compounds.	1
Earlier studies have reported higher @di$ caries @/di$ prevalence in CD patients compared to controls. Indeed CD patients exhibited higher levels of LB and @gm$ SM @/gm$. Brito et al. reported an increased mean value in the decayed, missed, filled teeth (DMF-T) score amongst CD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, a study from the US reported that patients with CD had more @di$ caries @/di$, increased mouth dryness and visited the dentist more often. A questionnaire study from our group showed that patients with CD perceived their oral health to be poor and reported significantly more mouth-related problems and a greater requirement for dental treatment compared to a control group. Thus, the aim of present study was to test the hypothesis that patients with CD have a higher prevalence and risk for @di$ caries @/di$ compared to people without CD.	1
Eighty-eight differentially abundant bacteria were selected from the young group between the healthy and @di$ CRC @/di$ groups. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, and Eubacterium siraeum were enriched in the samples from healthy individuals. Ruminococcus bromii, Bacteroides fragilis, and @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ were enriched in @di$ CRC @/di$ samples.	1
Emerging evidence has suggested a potential impact of gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of @di$ heart failure @/di$ (@di$ HF @/di$). However, it is still unknown whether @di$ HF @/di$ is associated with dysbiosis in gut microbiota. We investigated the composition of gut microbiota in patients with @di$ HF @/di$ to elucidate whether gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with @di$ HF @/di$. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of fecal samples obtained from 12 @di$ HF @/di$ patients and 12 age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects, and analyzed the differences in gut microbiota. We further compared the composition of gut microbiota of 12 @di$ HF @/di$ patients younger than 60 years of age with that of 10 @di$ HF @/di$ patients 60 years of age or older. The composition of gut microbial communities of @di$ HF @/di$ patients was distinct from that of HC subjects in both unweighted and weighted UniFrac analyses. Eubacterium rectale and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ were less abundant in the gut microbiota of @di$ HF @/di$ patients than in that of HC subjects. Compared to younger @di$ HF @/di$ patients, older @di$ HF @/di$ patients had diminished proportions of Bacteroidetes and larger quantities of Proteobacteria. The genus Faecalibacterium was depleted, while Lactobacillus was enriched in the gut microbiota of older @di$ HF @/di$ patients. These results suggest that patients with @di$ HF @/di$ harbor significantly altered gut microbiota, which varies further according to age. New concept of heart-gut axis has a great potential for breakthroughs in the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approach for @di$ HF @/di$.	1
Encephalitis due to @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ shows predilection for the brainstem, cerebellar peduncle, and cerebellum as in this patient. Other infrequent sites of involvement include supratentorial white matter, thalamus, internal capsule, and spinal cord.   Most common MRI feature is the T2 hyperintensity followed by contrast enhancement as seen in this patient.  Other MRI findings include abscess formation, hydrocephalus, edema, and @di$ hemorrhages @/di$. We noted patchy areas of diffusion restriction indicating areas of necrosis. The regions of restricted diffusion were surrounded by hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images that most likely denoted as edema.   The typical distribution patterns in L. rhombencephalitis may be due to the proliferation and spread of @gm$ L . monocytogenes @/gm$ along the intracerebral tracts.   In rhombencephalitis, lesions are usually confined to brainstem and cerebellum. Rarely, it can involve internal capsule, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. This might lead to misdiagnosis as herpes encephalitis or demyelination as in our patient. MRI has a major role in early diagnosis of L. rhombencephalitis , as isolation of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ by culture or PCR may be possible only in up to 50 to 60% of cases.	1
Encephalomyocarditis viruses were identified in semicaptive bonobos, although identified genotypes were different from those identified in the previous fatal @di$ myocarditis @/di$ epidemic at the same site in 2009. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. including symbiotic @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$, T.	0
Enteric Salmonella and Yersinia species cause various gut-associated symptoms (e.g., enteritis, ileitis, colitis, vomitting, intestinal @di$ cramping @/di$, and inflammatory diarrhea), and in rare cases they can lead to systemic infections and induce extra-intestinal sequelae such as fatal respiratory, hepatic, spleen, and/or neurological damage, erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis. Inflammatory diarrhea, which is typically associated with the highly invasive Yersinia species Y. enterocolitica and @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, and enteroinvasive Salmonella serotypes is characterized by an acutely increased vascular permeability and the recruitment of neutrophils which result in the formation of tissue exudates and necrotic lesions.	1
Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid)is caused by Salmonella typhi and @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi @/gm$. It is spread by fecal-oral route, largely through contamination of water and foodstuff. Developing countries are the worst affected. It takes 7 - 21 days from ingestion of the organism to manifestation of symptoms which are generally @di$ Fever @/di$, relative bradycardia, and pain abdomen.	1
Enteric fever is caused by Salmonella typhi or @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi A @/gm$ and accounts for nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide. It is an acute illness characterized by fever, @di$ anorexia @/di$, nausea, vomiting, sometimes constipation, and bloody diarrhea along with hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia.	1
Enterobacter genus has 13 species although @gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$ and E. cloacae are the two key species. Additionally, both species are significant nosocomial pathogens that can cause various opportunistic infections such as @di$ bacteremia @/di$, skin infections, soft-tissue infections, UTIs, endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections, lower respiratory tract infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, ophthalmic infections, among many others.	1
Enterococci are Gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacteria which can cause a variety of diseases in humans, including @di$ septicaemia @/di$, endocarditis, urinary tract infections, wound infections, and meningitis. In the past few years, @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$ has been mentioned with increased frequency with regard to teeth with asymptomatic persistent endodontic infections, predominantly in therapy-resistant endodontic infections. @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ have been able to form biofilms in root canals, and this ability can be important for bacterial resistance and persistence after endodontic procedures.	1
Enterococci are usually considered to be commensals of the human gastrointestinal tract; however, upon spreading into the bloodstream, they can cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and endocarditis that are associated with high mortality. Enterococcus species are a common cause of nosocomial infections, such as urinary tract, device-associated and surgical-site wound infections, as well as @di$ bacteremia @/di$. The most important enterococcal species associated with disease in humans are E. faecalis and @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$.	1
Enterotoxigenic @gm$ Bacteroides fragilis @/gm$ (ETBF) is a human gut commensal bacteria that causes @di$ inflammatory diarrhea @/di$ and colitis.	1
Eosinophils are present in response to low doses of @gm$ MSS @/gm$ and the presence of eosinophils in the lung after exposure to non-infectious agents is anticipated to be associated to allergic, @di$ asthma-like symptoms @/di$. Importantly, eosinophils can also contribute to resolution processes in @di$ asthma @/di$ (Takeda et al. 2015), but their significance and role in @gm$ MSS @/gm$-induced airway hypersensitivity remains misunderstood. Therefore, we set out to further evaluate the importance of this cell population in the response to @gm$ MSS @/gm$ crude extract exposure. However, we found that low-dose exposure to @gm$ MSS @/gm$ induces only a weak CD4/IL-13+ response and recruitment of eosinophils (Nakajima et al. 1992; Pope et al. 2001), and no devolopment of AHR, a response associated with the presence of eosinophils (Cockcroft and Davis 2006). Accordingly, we examined the functional significance of eosinophils in the airway inflammatory response to MSS, and on their potential harmful impact in disease. We first assessed the activation of eosinophil recruitment pathways in response to @gm$ MSS @/gm$. We analyzed eotaxins and IL-33 production, which are well-known chemokines involved in eosinophil recruitment. qRT-PCR analyses revealed no increase in eotaxins Ccl11 (Eotaxin-1) and Ccl24 (Eotaxin-2) following @gm$ MSS @/gm$ crude extract exposure, but an increase in Il33 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A). IL-33 is a potent activator of lung ILC2s (Neill et al. 2010), which, in turn, recruit eosinophils in allergy development (Gold et al. 2014). To assess whether @gm$ MSS @/gm$-induced expression of IL-33 promotes the expansion of lung ILC2s, we quantified lung ILC2s following antigen challenge by flow cytometry (Lineage-CD45+Sca1+CD90.2+CD25+ST2+). The frequency of lung ILC2s was unchanged following exposure to @gm$ MSS @/gm$ (Fig. 4B). Thus, these results suggest that @gm$ MSS @/gm$-induced eosinophil recruitment to the lungs is not induced by type I hypersensitivity mechanisms.	0
Especially in infant development, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, the main HMO-degrader in the gut microbiota, provides various benefits by colonizing the infant's gut. Suligoj et al. reported that the addition of 2'-FL and LNnT increased the amount of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and acetate production in the adult fecal microbiota, the same as in infants. In this study, although SL is a class of HMO, it did not show a bifidogenic effect (Table 1). Contrarily, significant increases in the propionate-producing Phascolarctobacterium and Alistipes and the butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae, Agathobacter, and Subdoligranulum were observed, resulting in SCFAs increasing in the culture supernatant. These results suggest that SL may have different functions in the adult gut microbiota from the roles in the gut microbiota of infants. Our findings revealed that SL did not increase @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, which is consistent with a previous study in which SL was administered to neonatal piglets. Propionate and butyrate are known for their bioactivity, such as protection against cardiovascular injury, energy source for IECs, and anti-inflammatory effect by regulatory T-cell induction. In an observational study of Chinese patients with @di$ benign meningiomas @/di$ and malignant gliomas, the relative abundances of Escherichia-Shigella, Lachnospira, and Agathobacter, altered by SL in the present study, were biomarkers of brain diseases via the gut-brain axis.	0

Evaluation of bacterial taxa that were detected in @di$ PC @/di$ as well as CF, MIL, and LIT samples of, at least, a cheese making site with a prevalence of >70% in at least three matrices resulted in the identification of 13 bacterial genera. Among the latter, two taxa, i.e., @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and members of Lachnospiraceae family, were shared across four cheese making sites and an additional three, i.e., Bacteroides, Streptococcus, and U. m. of Actinobacteria class, were shared across three Parmesan cheese production plants. Intriguingly, due to their detection in all sampled matrices, these taxa represent the core microbiota of the Parmesan cheese production chain, including faecal samples of dairy cattle, milk, and fresh cheese. Notably, raw-milk cheeses, such as Parmesan cheese, are produced using non-pasteurized milk. Thus, despite the fact that microbial profiling based on 16S rRNA gene sequences cannot distinguish between DNA of viable or dead cells, it is expected that many of the bacterial taxa constituting the core microbiota of the Parmesan cheese production chain will in fact reach dairy consumers as viable microbial cells due to the absence of thermal treatments during Parmesan cheese production. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the dominance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus in the average @di$ PC @/di$ microbiota (Table 1) (Supplementary Data 1) is supported by their addition during whey inclusion, thus increasing the load of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus strains transmitted from CF, LIT, and MIL samples. Nevertheless, as was demonstrated by shotgun sequencing analyses and by the use of PCR-strain-specific primers (see below), strains of these two genera assembled in @di$ PC @/di$ samples are also found in CF, LIT, and MIL samples.	0
Even though experimental evidence indicates that gingipains represent major virulence factors of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$, the relative contributions of the catalytic and hemagglutinin domains of RgpA to pathogenesis in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-mediated human diseases remain unclear. To gain further insight into the potential roles of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ gingipains in RA and PD, we therefore elected to focus on gingipain RgpA, known to be endowed with the potential to induce significant bone loss in model systems. Profiling of the antibody response to specific recombinant RgpA domains in patients with RA and PD led us to test the potential protective effects of RgpA domains in an experimental @di$ arthritis @/di$ model.	1
Examples of genera include Citrobacter, @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$, Erwinia, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Morganella, Pantoea, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia, Shigella, and Yersinia. Enterobacteria can cause a variety of diseases such as @di$ nonalcoholic steatohepatitis @/di$, allergy, eczema, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, bacteremia, and neonatal meningitis.	1
Excessive mucin degradation is associated with increased @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$ and increased penetration of bacteria into the dense mucosal mucus layer. In gnotobiotic mice mono-colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron, a diet lacking complex polysaccharides (including fiber) resulted in a thinner colonic mucus layer, an increased proximity of colonic microbes to the gut epithelium, and increased expression of the @di$ inflammatory @/di$ marker REG3beta. Similarly, it has been shown that dietary fiber deprivation increased the abundance of mucus-degrading bacteria like A. muciniphila and @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ in mice, subsequently leading to an alteration of the intestinal barrier and higher susceptibility to mucosal pathogens.	1
Experiments have recently been reported in which inoculation of Clostridiales species, either as a consortium or as monotherapy with @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$, or a Bacteroidales consortium could reduce development of food allergy in OVA sensitized mice by acting through MyD88 and RORgammat. An association between @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ and A. muciniphila has also been reported in a study of @di$ overweight @/di$/obese individuals.	2
Experiments of fecal microbiota transplantation have shown a link between gut microbiota and malnutrition, reduction in intestinal peristalsis, increase in gastrointestinal transit time, dysfunction of the intestinal barrier, intestinal hypersensitivity, and anxiety-like or @di$ depression @/di$-like phenotypes. Analysis of gut dysbiosis has also been performed in animal models of AN such as the activity-based anorexia rat model, in which changes in the abundance of bacterial species have been described. Indeed, in food-restricted animals, it was reported an increase in the number of Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Prevotella, and @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium with respect to control animals.	1
Exploiting probiotic microorganisms as coadjuvants in the treatment or prevention of @di$ obesity @/di$ is of clinical relevance. @di$ Obesity @/di$ is a pathological condition that consists of abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, which in turn often drives to other chronic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome, insulin-resistance, and cardiovascular pathologies. Moreover, this condition is typically associated with several other biomarkers. Due to aberrant intestinal permeability and mucus thickness, @di$ obese @/di$ patients display high levels of lipopolysaccharide in the bloodstream, a condition known as metabolic endotoxemia, which can lead to a constant state of systemic low-grade inflammation. This prolonged inflammatory state contributes to insulin-resistance, triggering the onset of type-2 diabetes and metabolic issues. Several studies showed how different probiotic strains were able to improve @di$ obesity @/di$-related conditions. By restoring mucus thickness and tight junctions' expression or regulating the production of different cytokines, probiotics can improve the gut barrier integrity and modulate immune functions, as well as stimulate the secretion of satiety-related hormones through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Besides these specific mechanisms of action, probiotics can also modulate the gut microbiota composition, thus triggering cascading effects that affect the entire organism. Considering the severe alteration in the fecal microbiota observed in @di$ obese @/di$ patients, with higher levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and lower abundances of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Akkermansia than normal-weight subjects, the administration of probiotics may be considered a potential therapeutic approach aimed at restoring eubiosis of the intestinal flora and counteracting the clinical scenario of @di$ obesity @/di$.	2
Exposure to @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$ may result in subclinical kidney injury manifesting as hypertension during pregnancy. We evaluated the risk of pregnancy-related hypertension (@di$ PRH @/di$) among previously healthy females from the Walkerton Health Study, Canada (2002-6), who conceived within five years of exposure to bacteria-contaminated drinking water. Ontario Ministry of Health Antenatal forms were used to determine outcomes and risk factors. @di$ PRH @/di$ was defined as any systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or =140 mm Hg and > or =90 mm Hg, respectively. Chronic and @di$ gestational hypertension @/di$ were defined, respectively, as elevated BP observed prior to or at > or =20 weeks gestation. Risk of @di$ PRH @/di$ was evaluated using a modified Poisson regression model that controlled for known risk factors. Of 148 eligible pregnancies, antenatal audits with blood pressure data were available for 135. @di$ PRH @/di$ was detected in 20.7% pregnancies, of which 6.7% were chronic hypertension and 14.1% @di$ gestational hypertension @/di$. Although nonsignificant, we observed a consistent trend toward higher rates of @di$ PRH @/di$ and mean arterial pressure, particularly prior to 20 weeks gestation, among women who reported symptomatic gastroenteritis compared to asymptomatic women.	1
Expression of the GLP-1 receptor in the liver of @di$ NAFLD @/di$ patients is significantly downregulated, and butyrate supplementation enhances the expression of the GLP-1 receptor in the livers of mice with @di$ NAFLD @/di$ by inhibiting HDAC-2, which in turn promotes energy metabolism and inhibits lipid accumulation. It also enhances insulin sensitivity, activates AMPK to promote the expression of fatty acid oxidation genes in hepatocytes, and reduces fat deposition in NFLAD mice. In an HFD-induced @di$ NAFLD @/di$ mouse model, dietary supplementation with sodium butyrate reportedly increased the abundance of Christensenellaceae, @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, and Lactobacillus in the intestine, forming a beneficial positive feedback cycle by producing more butyric acid. In another study, butyrate attenuated @di$ NAFLD @/di$-induced intestinal mucosal injury by increasing the expression of ZO-1 in the intestinal tract of mice, thereby preventing the migration of enterotoxins to the liver and inhibiting liver inflammation.	2
Extrapulmonary infections, including @di$ arthritis @/di$, are scarce and not systematically related to pneumonia, suggesting a multi-faceted infectious process. Herein, we report a case of @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ monoarthritis in an immunosuppressed woman, following a fall on wet asphalt and intra-articular corticosteroid (CS) injections.	1
FN and major infections (ie, @di$ bloodstream infection @/di$, typhlitis, invasive fungal infection, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile enterocolitis) were identified. Significant shifts in GM composition and diversity were observed during HCT, with the largest alterations occurring after initiation of antibiotics. Loss of diversity persisted without a return to baseline at hematologic recovery. GM in patients with FN was enriched in Mogibacterium, Bacteroides fragilis, and @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$, whereas increased abundance of Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Blautia, and Collinsella was observed in patients without fever.	0
Fasting glucose was positively correlated with Dorea in 3 studies, a correlation which remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, body fat, and diet in females with @di$ obesity @/di$, and was not associated with BMI in a population with overweight and @di$ obesity @/di$ (Supplemental Table 5). Two studies showed elevated concentrations in subjects with prediabetes in comparisons with normoglycemic controls, matched or adjusted for age and sex and for waist-to-hip ratio and inflammatory markers. In 1 of these studies, Dorea was only elevated in Danish but not Indian individuals with prediabetes. However, 2 Dorea species (@gm$ D. formicigenerans @/gm$ and D.	1
Fecal samples from children were screened for pathogenic Aeromonas, Campylobacter, and Vibrio species, as well as for Enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$. The drinking water risk was determined using @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ as an indicator of contamination. Nineteen (9.5%) children were colonized with pathogens and classified as carriers, all without @di$ diarrhea @/di$ symptoms. Of 199 drinking water samples, 38 (19.1%) were classified as very high risk because of high fecal contamination (> 100 @gm$ E. coli @/gm$/100 mL). Shared-use water sources, daily washing of containers, and washing using only water were associated with higher prevalence of bacterial carriage, whereas there was no association between households reporting boiling and chlorination of water and carrier status. The prevalence of carriage in children exposed to very high-risk water was 2.82 (95% CI: 1.21-6.59) times the prevalence of those who consumed less contaminated water, adjusted by the water source and daily washing. Our results suggest that household drinking water plays an important role in the generation of carriers with diarrheal pathogens. Our findings also highlight the importance of interventions to ensure the safety of drinking water. Further studies are needed to validate the observed association and determine its significance with respect to @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in the community.	1
Feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (HFS) diets entails diet-induced @di$ obesity @/di$, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the @di$ obese @/di$ phenotype of Western societies. The aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male Wistar rats fed a HFS diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. For this purpose, DNA extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the V4-V6 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Short-chain fatty acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) and class level (Erisypelotrichi, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Bacilli). Interestingly, the class Clostridia showed a significant decrease after HFS diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. Of particular interest, Clostridium cluster XIVa species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (Mitsuokella jalaludinii, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridium sp. FCB90-3, Prevotella nanceiensis, Clostridium fusiformis, Clostridium sp. BNL1100 and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. These results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and @di$ obesity @/di$ development.	1
"Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) is a ""natural health product."" The high incidence of dental caries, @di$ gingivitis @/di$, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. The potential role of FPP against common oral microbiota (@gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. FPP showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/mL: @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$: -6.9%; S. mitis: -4.47%, P < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/mL: @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$: +6.38%; L. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/mL: @gm$ S. mutans @/gm$: 1.01%, P < 0.01; S. mitis: 7.66%, P < 0.05) of tested microbiota. The results of this study suggest that low doses of FPP may be a suitable complement to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and @di$ gingivitis @/di$."	2
Fifteen months later, the horse became @di$ depressed @/di$ and febrile. A splenic abscess containing @gm$ Bacteroides ruminicola @/gm$ and Clostridium sporogenes was found at necropsy.	1
Figure 1 showed that the relative abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in rectum of group C-1 was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05), corresponding with lower @di$ diarrhea @/di$ rate and higher ADG in this group; the relative abundance of Turicibacter in group A was significantly higher than that in the other groups (P < 0.05); the relative abundance of Bacteroides in group A-1 was significantly higher than that in other groups (P < 0.05); the relative abundance of Enterococcus in group B-1 was significantly higher than that in other groups (P < 0.05); the abundance of Shigella in group A-1 and group B-1 was significantly higher than that in other groups (P < 0.05); the abundance of Pasteurella in group B-1 was significantly higher than that in group C-1 (P < 0.05). It was speculated that CFA was better than antibiotics to decrease @di$ diarrhea @/di$ rates through increasing beneficial bacterium abundance such as @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and decreasing harmful bacterium abundance such as Shigella, corresponding with the previous report. Therefore, the effect of CFA on improving broiler growth and reducing @di$ diarrhea @/di$ rate may be achieved through effective regulation of intestinal microflora.	2
Finally it should be noted that @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ is not without mortality in elderly patients where @di$ sepsis @/di$ secondary to skin ulceration, or complications of treatment, can contribute to death in patients with significant co-morbidities or frailty due to age.	1
Finally, abundances of Bacteroides fragilis and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ also correlated positively with plasma sCD14 fold change. (Table 1). These results suggest that a complex network of bacteria, including Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae, might influence weight and @di$ inflammation @/di$ in ART-treated PWH.	1
Finally, increased levels of @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$, a genus belonging to Actinobacteria and significantly augmented with prebiotics, correlated with higher urinary levels of hippurate. @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$ has been associated with a low risk of colon cancer, and patients with IBD present lower gut levels of this genus than do control individuals. Hippurate is a gut-derived metabolite commonly associated with a 'healthy phenotype'. It is decreased in @di$ diabetes @/di$ and obesity and increases following bariatric surgery. Moreover, it is one of the main discriminant metabolites explaining the difference in urine metabolic profiles between lean and obese or @di$ diabetic @/di$ individuals. Thus, increased levels of @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ and urinary hippurate could be considered as a beneficial effect associated with ITF fermentation.	2
Finally, our @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$, fecal hydroquinone, L-cystine, and 12-keto-tetrahydro-LTB4 model noninvasively detected @di$ CKD @/di$ of differing severities. Notably, the power of this model is superior to that of the independent serum creatinine level for identifying mild @di$ CKD @/di$. This finding suggests that the breakdown of intestinal metabolism by gut microbiota appears earlier than serum uremia toxin storage in the host, providing an early diagnostic and therapeutic target for @di$ CKD @/di$.	1
Finally, the results for DS, which was dominated by @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ C2.27, also show a reduction in the fungal diversity, probably related to the antifungal properties of the starter strain, while @di$ DB @/di$, with a S.	0
Finally, we examined faecal gluconate levels as well as the abundance and prevalence of species carrying gluconate operon genes in paediatric patients with @di$ UC @/di$ in active (mild versus moderate to severe) and inactive states from the PROTECT cohort (Extended Data Fig. 12a). Intensity of faecal gluconate (C6H12O7) as predicted by LC-MS was used as a proxy for intestinal concentration, and was positively associated with levels of faecal calprotectin (Extended Data Fig. 12b). Supporting the idea that gluconate confers improved fitness to Enterobacteriaceae, metagenomic species (MSPs) within Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli that carry gluconate kinase and transporter genes were significantly more prevalent and abundant in @di$ UC @/di$ patients in active versus inactive disease states (Fig. 4d-g). In addition, classical gluconate operon-encoding Veillonellaceae and Selenomonadaceae family members, such as @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ and Megamonas funiformis, were significantly enriched in @di$ UC @/di$ patients with moderate/severe versus inactive disease (Fig.	1
Finally, we identified agmatine as an alternate energy source for @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ in vivo. Agmatine is a host metabolite with multiple roles as a neurotransmitter, regulator of nitric oxide synthesis, and regulator and precursor of polyamine metabolism. Although agmatine can be synthesized at low levels by the host, particularly in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract is thought to be a major source of systemic agmatine :sourced either directly from the diet and/or from microbial metabolism. Dietary sources of agmatine include a variety of plant and animal products, with the highest known levels in fermented foods and alcoholic beverages. Altered agmatine levels have been associated with a range of diseases, including depression and @di$ diabetes @/di$. Notably, reduced agmatine levels in the gut have been linked to cell proliferation and cancer. Therefore, depletion of gastrointestinal agmatine by gut microbes including @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ has the potential to impact host health and disease.	1
First line antimicrobials for @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ infections such as macrolides, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones can result in exacerbation of the myasthenia gravis, with the additional risk of myasthenic crisis, and should only be used if absolutely necessary and with close monitoring. While treatment success of localized @di$ skin infections @/di$ has been reported for @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ with clarithromycin alone, a combination therapy of at least two susceptible agents is recommended to minimize the risk of resistance, particularly if empiric treatment is initiated. A @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ infection in a steroid-dependent patient with myasthenia gravis that was resistant to clarithromycin and was successfully treated with linezolid has also been reported.	1
First, a murine model of STm infection-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, which closely recapitulates human STm-induced gastroenteritis, was used in Lm-immune mice. A significant and robust expansion of CD44hi CD27neg Vgamma1.1neg Vgamma2neg gammadelta T cells was observed that was remarkably similar to the recall response induced by Lm challenge (Fig. 5a to c). Foodborne infection of Lm-immune mice with the zoonotic pathogen @gm$ Yp @/gm$, which has a different life cycle and colonizes intestinal and extra-intestinal sites in both humans and mice, induced a modest increase in the numbers of CD44hi CD27neg Vgamma1.1neg Vgamma2neg gammadelta T cells (Fig. 5c). In contrast, foodborne infection of Lm-immune mice with Cr, a murine pathogen widely used to model human enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infection, failed to induce a response of CD44hi CD27neg Vgamma1.1neg Vgamma2neg gammadelta T cells in the MLN at 5 days post infection (dpi) (Fig. 5b and c). In contrast to the previously used pathogens which efficiently disseminate to the MLN, Cr is primarily confined to the lumen in immunocompetent hosts. Since this spatial constraint may contribute to Cr's inability to expand memory Vgamma4Vdelta1 T cells in vivo, Lm-immune mice were i.p. infected with Cr to bypass the gut epithelium. This led to the early colonization of the MLN and spleen (Fig. S5) and a robust response of CD44hi CD27neg Vgamma1.1neg Vgamma2neg gammadelta T cells in the MLN at 5 dpi (Fig. 5d to f). Similar response patterns were observed after primary infection of naive mice, as STm infection-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, i.p.	1
Five 25-yr-old crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni and Crocodylus porosus) were diagnosed with @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$-associated septicemia accelerated by improper thermoregulation. At necropsy, pulmonary congestion and @di$ pleural effusion @/di$ were the main lesions in the thorax. Necrotizing enteritis, intestinal hemorrhage, fibrinous serositis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis were observed in the abdominal cavities of all five crocodiles. @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ was identified in the @di$ pleural effusions @/di$ and abdominal ascites of all necropsied crocodiles by using an API system 20NE. Aeromonas hydrophila infection and evaluation of virulence were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA and extracellular hemolysin gene. The crocodiles in the present case were housed in an indoor facility at a private zoo that failed to optimize land and water portions of the enclosure, exposing the animals to impeded thermoregulation, and it is suggested that the pathogenesis was accelerated by the improper thermoregulation-induced stress. This is the first description of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ pathogenicity associated with impeded thermoregulation in reptiles.	1
"Five bacteria (Mogibacterium diversum, @gm$ Ethanoligenens harbinense @/gm$, Roseburia hominis, Ruminococcus sp. SR1/5, and Bacteroides dorei) were negatively correlated with the EED severity (r2 between -0.21 and -0.27) and detected in at least 40% of the children stools (Figure S9I). Interestingly, only M. diversum was negatively correlated with all the parameters studied (EED severity [r2 = -0.27], @di$ L% @/di$ [r2 = -0.20], MPO [r2 = -0.26], and diarrhea prevalence [r2 = -0.25]). Further, M. diversum abundance in stools was higher in the ""normal"" children compared to the children with ""severe"" EED (2.7-fold), with ""severe"" @di$ L% @/di$ (4-fold), and with diarrhea (2-fold). Similarly, @gm$ E. harbinense @/gm$ was higher (2.3-fold) in the stools of ""normal"" children compared to the children with ""severe"" EED."	2

Four bacteria (Clostridium taeniosporum, Hungatella hathewayi, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Cryotobacterium curtum) were less prevalent (between 40% and 58%) and abundant (<1.3-log rpm per stool) in the stools, but they were detected at higher level (2.2-, 2-, 2.6-, and 2-fold, respectively) in the stools of ""normal"" children compared to the children with ""severe"" MPO. Further, Selenomonas ruminantium was also detected at higher level (2-fold) in children with no @di$ diarrhea @/di$ compared to the ones with @di$ diarrhea @/di$."	2
Five kinds of species were significantly enriched in patients with @di$ fever @/di$, namely Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter unclassified, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and six species were significantly enriched in patients with non-@di$ fever @/di$, namely Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45 (Figure 3A). This result shows that patients with @di$ fever @/di$ have significantly more pathogens but lack butyrate-producing species, which may lead to local overactivated immunity and linked to the hyperinflammation in @di$ fever @/di$. Spearman's rank correlation test also showed that the significantly enriched species in patients with @di$ fever @/di$ were associated with the clinical indices. For example, S. cerevisiae was positively correlated with diarrhea (rho=0.55, p=0.001), and E. faecalis was positively correlated with LDH (rho=0.54, p=0.002) and D-dimer (rho=0.55, p=0.001), and negatively correlated with CD8+T cells (rho=-0.42, p=0.02) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) (rho=-0.42, p=0.02) (Figure 3B). Among the significantly enriched species in patients with non-@di$ fever @/di$, E. bacterium_6_1_45 and B. fragilis were positively correlated with lymphocytes (rho=0.50, p=0.004; rho=0.37, p=0.04, respectively), and @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ was negatively correlated with LDH (rho=-0.42, p=0.02), AST (rho=-0.38, p=0.03) and IL-6 (rho=-0.44, p=0.01) (Figure 3B).	2
Five species, such as Dorea longicatena and @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$ (P < 0.001), were reduced in patients with a long history of drinking. Collinsella intestinalis was inversely related to lung adenocarcinoma (P < 0.05), while it presented at a higher abundance in patients with @di$ small cell lung cancer @/di$ (P < 0.05).	0
Flow cytometric analysis was used to examine naive and primed or memory CD4 cells extracted from periodontal lesions compared with cells from peripheral blood of healthy subjects before and after stimulation with the periodontopathic bacteria, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In peripheral blood, approximately 60% and 40% of CD4 cells were CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ respectively at day 0. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) induced CD45RO expression on almost 100% of CD4 cells. However, @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ and F. nucleatum stimulation did not cause any significant change in percentage of CD45RO+ CD4 cells except for a loss of antigen at day 6 together with re-expression at day 7, which also occurred on cells cultured in medium only. CD45RA expression on PHA and bacterial-stimulated peripheral blood CD4 cells remained fairly stable for the 10-d culture period. Greater than 90% CD4 cells extracted from healthy or marginal gingivitis (H/@di$ MG @/di$) and adult periodontitis (AP) lesions were CD45RO+ and this was maintained on AP cells throughout the 6-d culture period, except for a small decrease in the percentage of positive cells induced by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ at day 3. Approximately 9% CD4 cells from H/@di$ MG @/di$ tissue were CD45RA+, but about 22% AP cells expressed this antigen, and this increased again in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$- and F. nucleatum-stimulated cultures after 3 d. Therefore, in peripheral blood @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ and F.	1
Fn is an anaerobic, invasive, and pro-inflammatory bacterium, mainly linked to @di$ periodontitis @/di$ but also associated with odontogenic abscesses and other oropharyngeal diseases such as Lemierre's syndrome. It is rare in the faecal microbiome and, until recently, never described in colon adenocarcinomas. With an activity similar to @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$, it causes a stimulation of IL-8 (pro-inflammatory cytokine) ten times longer than that caused by E.	1
Following microbiota depletion by antibiotic pretreatment, IL-10-/- mice develop acute campylobacteriosis characterized by wasting symptoms and @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$, by acute enterocolitis with colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and by enhanced pro-inflammatory immune responses in the intestinal tract, in extra-intestinal organs and even systemically within a week post oral C. jejuni infection. Furthermore, the pronounced C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ induced immune responses in those animals have been shown to be due to bacterial LOS-induced Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) signaling. This acute murine C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ infection and inflammation model which depends on bacterial motility, adhesion and invasion has been proven highly reliable in assessing the disease-alleviating properties of non-toxic natural compounds during acute campylobacteriosis as recently shown for cardamom-EO and clove-EO. Here, we assessed the gastrointestinal pathogen loads, the clinical outcome, the microscopic inflammatory changes and immune cell responses in the colon, the pro-inflammatory mediator secretion in the intestinal tract and beyond, and the bacterial translocation to extra-intestinal organs following garlic-EO as compared to placebo treatment of C. @gm$ jejuni @/gm$ infected secondary abiotic IL-10-/- mice.	1
Following the intravenous injection of live @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ O:8, 50-69% of SHR rats developed @di$ arthritis @/di$; these rats were antibody free against all rat pathogens tested. In contrast, only 20-25% of SHR rats which had serum antibodies against Bacillus piliformis, Kilham rat virus, and Toolan H-1 virus developed @di$ arthritis @/di$. The results indicate that the microbial load of the host has a profound effect on the susceptibility to experimental @di$ arthritis @/di$.	1
Foodborne botulism may occur when the toxin is present in food even if @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ is not alive. On the other hand, colonization of the host intestines by @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$ causes infant botulism and adult intestinal toxemia botulism (collectively termed intestinal botulism). In this case, ingested botulinum spores from food or the environment germinate in the intestines and subsequently produce BoNT. Healthy adults are resistant to botulinum infections, whereas infants are susceptible because of the immaturity of their intestinal microbiota. Some adults with risk factors, such as previous gastrointestinal surgery, anatomical @di$ bowel abnormalities @/di$, @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$, and antimicrobial treatment, are also susceptible to intestinal botulism. It is important to note that patients with intestinal botulism are chronically exposed to @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$; however, it is unknown whether components other than the BoNT complex affect its pathogenesis. In addition, limited information is currently available on host immune responses to @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$.	1
For @di$ ADF @/di$ group, we also found 54 bacterial biomarkers of species level may help to improve the apparent @di$ ADF @/di$ digestibility in H_@di$ ADF @/di$ group (LDA score > 2; Figure 3B). Of note, many biomarkers belong to the Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Roseburia, and these genera contain many microorganisms with fiber degradation function. We observed that 17 bacterial biomarkers of species level in H_NDF and H_@di$ ADF @/di$ groups were the same bacteria, such as Firmicutes bacterium CAG:124, Alistipes sp. CAG:435, Firmicutes bacterium CAG:114, Oscillibacter sp. ER4, Firmicutes bacterium CAG:145, Flavonifractor plautii, Selenomonas bovis, Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus, Clostridium clostridioforme, Tyzzerella nexilis, R. albus, Clostridium sp. ATCC BAA-442, Anaerovibrio lipolyticus, Intestinimonas sp. GD2, butyrate-producing bacterium SS3/4, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Ruminococcaceae bacterium cv2. These shared some biomarkers, which may affect the apparent NDF digestibility and apparent @di$ ADF @/di$ digestibility in pigs. In addition, Roseburia faecis, @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Clostridium methylpentosum in H_NDF group and Treponema bryantii in H_@di$ ADF @/di$ group are bacteria that contribute to the degradation of non-starch polysaccharides in the intestinal tract of pigs. We also found that only L_NDF and L_@di$ ADF @/di$ groups had significant enrichment of Lactobacillus, while H_NDF and H_@di$ ADF @/di$ groups did not. At the genus level, we found 85 and 25 bacterial genera that may contribute to fiber degradation in H_NDF and H_@di$ ADF @/di$ groups, respectively (LDA score > 2, Figures 3C,D). Where g Ruminococcus, g Alistipes, g unclassified o Clostridiales, g Lachnoclostridium, g unclassified f Ruminococcaceae, g Campylobacter, g Flavonifractor, g Anaerovibrio, and g Pseudoflavonifractor were common to H_NDF and H_@di$ ADF @/di$ groups.	2
For alpha diversity, @di$ AD @/di$ individuals showed a lower alpha diversity index than their control counterparts (P = 0.039) ( Figure 1A  ), while there was no significant difference in terms of Pielou's evenness, Shannon Diversity Index, and Simpson's Diversity Index (P = 0.9, 0.87, and 0.82, respectively). Additionally, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) could not make a distinction between individuals in the @di$ AD @/di$ group and those in the control group ( Figure 1B ). The LEfSe method was applied to identify the phylotypes abundant in these two groups ( Figures 1C, D ). A significant increase of Anaerostipes caccae and Eubacterium hallii was found in @di$ AD @/di$ individuals ( Figure 1D ), and @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$ was abundant in controls. Intriguingly, Bifidobacterium bifidum was richer in @di$ AD @/di$ individuals.	2
For example, @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$ neurotoxin serotypes A and B are commonly used as locally administered cosmetics (Botox) to reduce winkles. Additionally, it has been used as a therapeutic to reduce symptoms of hyperactive muscles, including headaches, urinary incontinence, eye movement abnormality, and limb @di$ spasticity @/di$.	2
For example, Lactobacillus plantarum is effective in the @di$ colitis @/di$ model, Bifidobacterium lactis and L. acidophilus in the food allergy model, and L. casei in the arthritis model. However, only a little information regarding the effects of lactic acid bacteria on EAE/MS exists. In the present study, we demonstrate that oral administration of @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ induces IL-10-producing regulatory T cells and suppresses EAE. @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ has been used as a starter culture for fermented sausages and is one of the human commensal bacteria. These data suggest that @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ can be a novel target for the treatment of human MS.	2
For example, Phaseolus vulgaris, a popular food in Asia and Eastern country, significantly reduced food intake, body @di$ weight gain @/di$, lipid accumulation, carbohydrate absorption, and metabolism in obese animals. Interestingly, P. vulgaris extract significantly increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and Akkermansia at the genus level and further improved insulin resistance in HFD mice.	2
For example, a case of fatal laboratory-acquired infection caused by @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ occurred in a laboratorian in 2009. No additional cases or major deficiencies in engineering controls were identified in this laboratory. A postmortem examination revealed that the affected worker had hereditary hemochromatosis, a condition that increases susceptibility to infection with certain bacterial pathogens. In another situation, @di$ Campylobacter infection @/di$ among poultry-processing workers was found to occur most frequently during the first weeks of work, after which the workers develop immunity that may be protective against future infection.	0
"For example, in 2015, at least 75 people died and some 180 fell ill, including a toddler, in the north-west of Mozambique, from apparent @di$ poisoning @/di$ after consuming during a wedding party traditional fermented beer (made of sorghum, bran, corn, sugar, with Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast, which belongs to the division Ascomycota, which represents the largest and most diverse group of fungi) known as ""pombe"" (Swahili word for beer). The exact cause of the contamination was later connected with bacterium @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ and two produced toxins, bongkrekic acid and toxoflavin."	1
For example, lean and skeletal muscle muscle mass were increased in obese mice that were fed the prebiotic, oligofructose, in association with alterations in gut microbiome composition, including increases in family-level Prevotellaceae, and genus-level Prevotella and @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$. In addition, @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ are decreased in association with the age-related reduction in the percentage of whole body lean mass in rats. Investigating further, probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus gasseri decreased muscle atrophy gene expression (i.e. Atrogin-1, MuRF1, LC3, Cathepsin L) and increased muscle mass in a mouse model of @di$ leukemia @/di$, and probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum increased lean mass, grip strength, and swimming endurance in young mice.	0
For example, oral microbiota genera Veillonella and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ promote the production of anti-microbial peptides and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, increasing the epithelial barrier function and thickness characteristic of oral mucosa. However, other studies have found that some pathogenic bacteria in oral microflora are not only related to oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, and @di$ oral ulcers @/di$, but also related to infective endocarditis and coronary atherosclerosis, pneumonia, obesity, intestinal diseases, etc.	0
For example, quercetin reduced the microbiota composition including the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and the growth of species associated with diet-induced obesity like Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacillus, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$, while restoring the barrier integrity in obese NAFLD model. In HFD/high sucrose-induced obesity models, polyphenol-rich cranberry extract diet and concord grape anthocyanins inhibited insulin resistance and @di$ inflammation @/di$ by mediating an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut microbiota.	2
For example, the beneficial effects of Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 and uncultured @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ subsp. (GCA-900066225) on health include degradation of resistant starch and stabilization of the intestinal barrier. The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae in the human gut is inversely related to host body mass index (BMI), @di$ obesity @/di$ and inflammatory bowel disease.	2
For example, the relative abundance of the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$, and Anaerostipes hadrus, which promote tumor immunotherapy response, were significantly increased after consumption of H. erinaceus. Additionally, the bacteria Roseburia intestinalis, which is associated with not responding to tumor immunotherapy, was downregulated. Also, H. erinaceus supplementation could reverse the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria enriched or reduced in some diseases, such as Bacteroides caccae enriched in metabolic arthritis patients, Phascolarctobacterium enriched in kidney stones patients, Romboutsia timonensis enriched in patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Streptococcus thermophilus that is a predictor of poor prognosis for @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$, and Coprococcus comes decreased in patients with chronic widespread pain. Studies have shown that some bacteria which can contribute to human health include SCFAs-producing bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Subdoligranulum) and other probiotics like @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$, Dialister. A previous study found that the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, and Roseburia in patients with metabolic arthritis were significantly decreased. Our results, measured using biochemical blood indices, demonstrate a downregulation in UA and CREA. Therefore, we propose that alterations in gut microbiota due to H. erinaceus intervention may be related to metabolic arthritis. In addition to the upregulation of SCFAs-producing bacteria after H. erinaceus intervention, we also found an increased abundance of @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$, which degrade fiber, pectin, and regulate glycolipid metabolism.	0
For example, the relative abundance of the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum, Parabacteroides merdae, and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, which promote tumor immunotherapy response, were significantly increased after consumption of H. erinaceus. Additionally, the bacteria Roseburia intestinalis, which is associated with not responding to tumor immunotherapy, was downregulated. Also, H. erinaceus supplementation could reverse the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria enriched or reduced in some diseases, such as Bacteroides caccae enriched in metabolic arthritis patients, Phascolarctobacterium enriched in kidney stones patients, Romboutsia timonensis enriched in patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Streptococcus thermophilus that is a predictor of poor prognosis for liver cirrhosis, and Coprococcus comes decreased in patients with @di$ chronic widespread pain @/di$.	2
For example, the therapeutic core bacteria Eubacterium, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, Anaerostipes and Ruminococcus spp. are known to participate in bacterial cross-feeding pathways that are responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) - the major microbial metabolites from carbohydrate fermentation. Concurrently, with the appearance of the therapeutic core taxa, we also observed a more than 20-fold increase in Ruminococcus obeum and Subdoligranulum variable, both of which are major SCFA-producing bacteria in the gut. SCFAs promote intestinal homeostasis by both strengthening epithelial cell layer integrity and stimulating regulatory T cells. Recently, Atarashi et al. treated @di$ inflammatory colitis @/di$ in a mouse model with a combination of 17 clostridial strains, which affected SCFA and regulatory T cell levels.	2
For example, we randomly selected one @di$ obese @/di$ individual and a corresponding counterfactual instance from China. By way of counterfactual inference, we found that for this @di$ obese @/di$ individual, the minimum modulation scheme was to increase the relative abundance of six bacteria (Bacteroides dorei, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Eubacterium eligens, and Eubacterium sp. _CAG_180) and reduce the relative abundance of four bacteria (Dorea longicatena, Blautia obeum, Ruminococcus gnavus, and @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$) (Fig. 5A). In this case, an @di$ obese @/di$ individual can trend towards health from the perspective of machine learning.	2
For instance, @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ and Lactobacillus attenuate pesticide-induced ROS production in wildlife and humans through glutathione peroxidase-like 2 and catalase (CAT), and Lactobacillus sp. inhibits D-galactose-induced OS and GM dysbiosis in mice through its antioxidant activity. Furthermore, two probiotic strains, L. plantarum TW1-1 and @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ GR-1, isolated from yak dairy significantly alleviate @di$ chromate toxicity @/di$ in mice.	2
For instance, @gm$ Ruminococcus obeum @/gm$ and Alistipes were most enriched in healthy individuals. Importantly, loss of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ has been associated with susceptibility to dextran sodium sulphate-induced @di$ colitis @/di$.	1
For instance, glucose-lowering, @di$ obesity @/di$-preventing, lipid-regulating, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects have been reported in diabetic and @di$ obese @/di$ models. More information about the health benefits of flavanones and derived metabolites can also be found in a review by Mas-Capdevila (2020). Liu et al. (2020) evaluated the effects of hesperidin (100 or 200 mg/kg BW) in HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice for 10 weeks. A. muciniphila was reduced in HFD-fed mice, but unexpectedly, it failed to be changed by hesperidin; instead, the treatment enriched Lactobacillus salivarius and Desulfovibrio and decreased Helicobacter ganmani, Helicobacter hepaticus, @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$, and Mucispirillum schaedleri in HFD-fed mice. Whereas the relative abundance of A. muciniphila was not significantly modulated by hesperidin, gut microbiota modulation was correlated with reduced BW and @di$ obesity @/di$-related disturbances.	2
For instance, in the pre-eradication subgroup, we observed increased levels of Acidaminococcus intestinalis, previously shown to be elevated in @di$ overweight @/di$ adults. Similarly, we detected increased levels of Collinsella aerofaciens and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$ in the pre-eradication subgroup.	1
For instance, over-representation of @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$, a Gram-negative sulfite-reducing bacteria that is commonly recovered from patients with appendicitis, had been associated with animal based diets and diets rich in fats. At least in HFD setting, increased production of taurine conjugated bile acids had been proposed to underlie the expansion of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$. The negative effect of increased abundance of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ on intestinal inflammation had been demonstrated, but despite its documented association with dietary fats, it remains unknown whether @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ imposes negative consequences on metabolic host function. Interestingly, higher level of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ had been similarly observed in individuals suffering from severe @di$ malnutrition @/di$.	1
For instance, persons with @di$ obesity @/di$ present a high Firmicute over Bacteroidetes rate compared to their lean and overweight counterparts. Furthermore, studies have found a stronger association with Firmicutes phylum species, such as Blautia hydrogenotorophica, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum, in patients with @di$ obesity @/di$; whereas, lean people have higher proportions of Bacteroides.	1
For the pathogenic-spiked biofilms, 48 h preformed biofilms were spiked with 6 x 105 CFU/mL of each @di$ periodontal pathogen @/di$ (@gm$ T. denticola @/gm$, F.	1
Forty years since the first identification of Legionnaires' disease, we still do not have a thorough understanding of how to prevent disease caused by the species @gm$ L. longbeachae @/gm$. Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include host characteristics and modifiable behavioral or environmental factors. Most published data have focused on the risk factors for L. pneumophila Legionnaires' disease: smoking, older age, chronic cardiovascular or respiratory disease, immunosuppression, and exposure to water aerosols. Data on the risk factors for @di$ L. longbeachae disease @/di$ are lacking, beyond the presumed association with compost exposure. Our study highlights some similarities and differences with risk factors for Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila. We found that COPD and smoking are host risk factors for @di$ L. longbeachae disease @/di$. Those who had ever smoked were twice as likely to get @di$ L. longbeachae disease @/di$ as those who had never smoked, and the risk was higher for those who had smoked longer.	0
Forty-one species were enriched in the non-smokers, including Alistipes finegoldii, indistinctus, onderdonkii, putredinis, senegalensis, shahii and spAP11; Bacteroides caccae, cellulosilyticus, clarus, intestinalis, nordii, oleiciplenus, plebeius and uniformis; Eubacterium eligens, ramulus, rectale and ventriosum; and @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, torques and inulinivorans (LDA>2,  Figure 3A ).  Supplementary Table 1  shows the detailed microbiota results. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore the correlations between species abundances and participant characteristics ( Figure 3B ). Some bacteria, including Bacteroidales bacterium pH8, B. eggerthii, Ruminococcus albus, and R. bromii, were positively correlated with inflammatory markers (i.e., @di$ NEC @/di$, LYC, MOC, WBC, and PLT) and were enriched in the smokers. Other bacteria, such as Eubacterium eligens, ramulus, rectale and ventriosum and @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, torques and inulinivorans were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers and were enriched in non-smokers.	2
Frequently, DD is accompanied by @di$ digestive tract inflammation @/di$ due to the increase of gram-negative enterobacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$, and Citrobacter koseri.	1
Fresh stool samples were isolated from 2014 to 2016 in Northwest China (Gansun, Shanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet) from calves (3 to 20 days) with @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Samples were stored in transport medium, cultured directly on Salmonella-@gm$ Shigella @/gm$ (SS) agar and incubated at 37  C for 24 h to select for @gm$ Shigella @/gm$. Resultant colonies (colorless, semitransparent, smooth, and moist circular) were picked and grown at 37  C for 24 h on MacConkey (MAC) Agar to verify identity. Colonies were selected and cultured in brain heart infusion broth at 37  C for 5 h with shaking at 250 rpm. All isolates were confirmed using API20E test strips (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy-l' Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ was serotyped using a commercially available kit (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and confirmed by PCR.	1
From a total of 1,087 non-repeat clinical samples collected during the study period, non-duplicate, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli that belong to either @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ spp. or Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 80 patents. Most of these patients, 73.7% (59/80) were male, and 26.3% (21/80) were female. Ninety percent (72/80) of these patients were admitted to different wards in the hospital [surgical ward (n = 52), intensive care unit (n = 6), pediatric ward (n = 3), and medical ward (n = 11)]. Clinical samples collected include urine for @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$, sputum for lower respiratory tract infections, wound swab for wound infections/abscess, and stools for diarrhea. Most of these patients were admitted to the hospital for other underlying diseases and developed infection after admission, and most of them were treated with locally available antimicrobial therapy. Among @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ isolates 68.2% (28/41) were from surgical ward, followed by 17.0% (7/41) from medical ward, and 9.7% (4/41) from the intensive care unit (Table 1A).	1

From an operational point of view, LTBI is defined as a state of persistent immune response to @gm$ MTb @/gm$ antigens detected either by the tuberculin skin test (TST) or by IGRA without evidence of clinically manifested tuberculosis. Therefore, LTBI subjects carry an increased risk of progression to @di$ TB @/di$ which is augmented in LTBI individuals with immune impairment as HIV coinfection or therapies with TNF-alpha inhibitors or other immune regulators used for inflammatory diseases and transplantation or compromised immunity due to noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.	1
From genome analysis of @gm$ B. crudilactis @/gm$ @gm$ LMG 23609 @/gm$, 48 genes encoding for GH were identified (Fig. 1a), among which 3 encode for GH family GH3 and 12 for GH13. Sixty-eight and 19 genes encoding for @di$ GT @/di$ and CBM were found, respectively (Fig.	0
From the mNGS results, it could be seen that @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ was the most abundant bacterial species detected by DNA sequencing, accounting for 43.80% of all cases (53/121), and turned out to be more prevalent in the non-ICU group (p < 0.001). @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ is an opportunistic pathogen that has been associated with endocarditis, COPD, @di$ otitis media @/di$, and, in rare cases, brain abscesses. As expected, nearly two-thirds of non-ICU patients with H. parainfluenzae infection suffered from tumors or COPD. When treated improperly, @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ may develop resistance mechanisms, that work alone or together, to confer decreased susceptibility to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. Although @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ was often considered a member of the normal flora, it may be the pathogen responsible for the disease in immunocompromised patients without other evidence of etiology, especially when antibiotics are not effective. The higher proportion of @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ in non-ICU patients is unclear, possibly because there are more patients with mixed infections and a higher proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the ICU patients, resulting in a low proportion of patients detected in the ICU patients.	1
Further investigation was carried out by submitting the @di$ HT-CFS @/di$ of the strains to casein zymography with the aim of assessing the caseinolytic activity related to extracellular thermostable enzymes. Indeed, the heat treatment applied to @di$ CFS @/di$ promotes the depletion of any pre-existing heat-labile endogenous or exogenous proteases and, therefore, favors the selection of thermostable proteases. Casein zymography showed that the @di$ HT-CFS @/di$ of P. poae, @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$, C. joostei, C. freundii, and S. marcescens contain a thermostable protease with an estimated molecular weight of about 45 kDa (data not shown). These results agreed with those of Bagliniere et al. and Zarei et al., who reported that @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ and Serratia strains isolated from bovine raw milk produce thermostable caseinolytic enzymes with an approximate molecular weight of 45-48 kDa.	0
Further profiling of Enterococci as an indicator organism in their studies revealed that @di$ MDR @/di$ isolates could be recovered from different sites. From the PCR based profiling of Enterococcus sp. heterogeneity in the river Ganga with the order of E. faecalis followed by E. faecium, E. durans, @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ and other Enterococci was revealed.	0
Further, @di$ K. pneumoniae infections @/di$ occur frequently in colonized patients, as shown in a previous analysis of the 2014 cohort, where a significant association between infection and colonization was observed. The current analysis using the first collected rectal swabs from each patient's first hospital encounter and their fecal microbiome demonstrated the same association with subsequent @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ clinical cultures.	1
Further, the potential of the lead compound as a preclinical candidate has been demonstrated in the murine thigh @di$ infection @/di$ model against MRSA and chronic burn-wound infection against @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$.	1
Further, to analyze at the species level, the relative abundance of Roseburia hominis, Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes onderdonkii, @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$, and Staphylococcus xylosus in the MSA group was higher than those in the healthy group, while the healthy group had more abundant Bacteroides coprocola, Megamonas funiformis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Clostridium nexile, Bacteroides plebeius, and Granulicatella adiacens. In addition, we did not detect the differential taxa at an FDR q value cutoff of 0.05 between @di$ MSA-C @/di$ and MSA-P subtypes.	0
Furthermore, Anaerotruncus that enriched in the antibiotic group are butyrate-producing bacteria with a positive correlation to saturated fatty acid and cholesterol intake; therefore, they are involved in @di$ obesity @/di$ and NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Citrobacter genus presented a low virulence activity following their colonization in the gastrointestinal tract. However, increased abundance of Citrobacter species might lead to severe diseases in respiratory and urinary tract, central nervous system, bloodstream, and intestines in the probiotic supplemented patients. Anaerofustis genus is associated with movement and psychiatric disorders as well as pro-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, decreased starch degradation, possibly as a result of Collinsella reduction, leads to low levels of SCFAs production and weakens the gut epithelial barrier and host immune response in the probiotic group. Moreover, certain commensal bacteria including Megasphaera, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, and Coprococcus were significantly increased in the antibiotic group. Although some studies indicated that @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ species, particularly Ruminococcus gnavus, are correlated with T2D, CD, and UC, certain species such as @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$, are abundant in healthy individuals and may lower cardiovascular risk and provide anti-inflammatory compounds through carbohydrate degradation. Furthermore, the proportion of gut @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ species is possibly associated with the number of CD8+ Treg cells in the human body, and thereby @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ bacteria may lower the risk for developing type 1 diabetes (T1D).	2
Furthermore, from recent large microbiome studies in @di$ melanoma @/di$ and NSCLC patients, we observed bacteria associated with favorable response such as Eubacterium ventriosum, Ruminococcus (Mediterraneibacter) torques, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ significantly overrepresented in H.	1
Furthermore, germ-free mice are susceptible to @di$ infection @/di$ with fungi such as Candida (Dollive et al., 2013). The commensal bacteria Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and @gm$ Blautia producta @/gm$ can reduce Candida colonization via secretion of antifungal peptides from colonic epithelial cells (Fan et al., 2015).	2
Furthermore, in the ileum, the abundance of OTUs closely related to Actinobacillus porcinus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Campylobacter fetus, Desulfovibrio piger, Agathobacter ruminis, Parabacteroides johnsonii, and Lactococcus piscium were higher (p < 0.05) in piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ compared to piglets without @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (Figure S12). The OTUs related to Butyricimonas virosa, Sharpea azabuensis, @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ and Tyzzerella nexilis were solely detected in the piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
Furthermore, in the ileum, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Butyricimonas, Desulfovibrio, Parabacteroides, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Candidatus Soleaferrea, and Parasutterella were higher (p < 0.05) in piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ compared to piglets without @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (Figure S10). Sharpea was solely detected in the piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$. In the colon, piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ resulted in a higher abundance of Enterococcus, and a lower abundance of Agathobacter (p < 0.05). Prevotella 7 was solely detected in piglets without @di$ diarrhea @/di$, and Oxalobacter was solely detected in piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
Furthermore, recent studies using Bacillus subtilis have demonstrated that the EPS capsule of this bacterium is able to protect against intestinal inflammation in a murine model of @di$ colitis @/di$ (in this instance via TLR4), providing further support for the likely role of bifidobacterial EPS in the effects observed in these studies. Notably, the probiotic genus @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ also produces distinct EPSs, which are structurally similar to those observed in bifidobacteria . Recently, within an in vitro system (HT29-19A epithelial cell line), the EPS from Lactobacillus acidophilus 5e2 was shown to increase IL-8 expression and also TLR2 expression (we also observe that B. breve UCC2003 induces IEC TLR2 expression), and additionally upregulation of TLR2 was found to potentially 'sensitize' epithelial cells to subsequent stimulation with peptidoglycan (a TLR2 agonist). Furthermore, the authors also observed a modest increase in TLR4 expression after addition of EPS, but did not detect any significant modulation of IL-8 responses after priming with EPS and subsequent addition of LPS, which may indicate less of a role for EPS-TLR4 interactions. From a more systemic perspective, in the instance that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ or indeed B.	2
Furthermore, supplementation of LA and 38W decreased the @di$ diarrhea @/di$ incidence compared with non-supplementation group. Consistent with results of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ incidence, the intestinal microbiome such as E. coli and SE was decreased in piglets supplemented with LA and 38W. These results are also in agreement with previous study showing anti-diarrheal activity and anti-pathogenic activity of L. plantarum and L. reuteri in weaned piglets. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species generally reduce pH in the presence of carbohydrate fermentation by producing lactic acid, suppressing pathogenic bacteria as a result. In addition, fecal noxious gases are affected by the nutrient digestibility and intestinal microbiota. Consistent with our results of digestibility and counts of intestinal pathogen bacteria, supplementation of LA and 38W decreased the concentration of NH3 and H2S. @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ based probiotics feed for weaned piglets reduce the emission of total mercaptans, NH3 and H2S, because more nutrients are digestible and less substrate for microbial fermentation in the colon.	2
Furthermore, the abundance of KEGG KOs and functional pathways associated with this species were highly depleted in @di$ psoriasis @/di$ patients, making a solid case that E. rectale could be the central piece of a microbial ecological functional unit, which may have health implications. Depletion of the butyrate-producing Eubacterium or E. rectale has also been reported in other diseases: Takahashi and colleagues observed a reduced relative abundance of Eubacterium genera in patients with Crohn's disease, and Vermeiren et al. reported a reduced diversity of fecal Clostridium coccoides/E. rectale species in patients with ulcerative colitis. Loomba et al. found that E. rectale was abundant in mild or moderate NAFLD, whereas Escherichia coli was the dominant species in advanced fibrosis. In parallel, these results suggest that the gut microbiota dysbiosis, particularly the depleted levels of E. rectale in the disease cohorts, may be related to the damaged mucus barrier and the progression of liver fibrosis. Additionally, we found that A. finegoldii and @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$ species were significantly reduced, which is consistent with previous findings in @di$ psoriasis @/di$ and a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease. It is interesting to note that the species profiles depleted in @di$ psoriasis @/di$ were somehow similar to those of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, in whom all the above-mentioned bacterial species are thought to play a protective role.	2
Furthermore, the gut microbiota, such as @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, can participate in purine and UA metabolism. Compositional bacterial alterations could plausibly contribute to the advancement of UA and thereby be a potential therapeutic target. Several studies regarding the gut microbiota have been reported in adults with @di$ gout @/di$; however, only one study in clinically healthy HUA adult male patients involved the structural and functional alterations of gut microbiota.	1
Furthermore, there are a few recent studies to support a potential beneficial effect of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in the management of drug resistant epilepsy. Using chemically kindled rats as a model of drug resistant epilepsy, investigators demonstrated that oral administration of a @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$-containing probiotic was associated with a significant decrease in epileptic activity. Rats that received the supplement had elevated concentrations of GABA in brain tissue compared to controls, supporting the premise that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ might influence @di$ seizure @/di$ control through alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission. A clinical study evaluating the fecal microbiome in 91 humans with epilepsy demonstrated increased abundance of Bifidobacteria and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in patients with 4 or fewer @di$ seizures @/di$ a year compared to patients with more than 4 @di$ seizures @/di$ a year, suggesting that these bacteria might play a protective role in epilepsy. An open-label, pilot study involving 45 humans with drug resistant epilepsy reported that 29% of patients experienced a > 50% reduction in @di$ seizures @/di$ after being administered a daily probiotic supplement containing @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$. Additional research is needed to substantiate these findings and further evaluate the effect of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in the treatment of epilepsy.	2
"Fusobacteria are common obligately anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria of the @di$ oral @/di$ cavity that may act as a bridge between early and late colonizing bacteria in dental plaque and have a role in @di$ oral @/di$ and extra-@di$ oral @/di$ infections. @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ has a crucial role in @di$ oral @/di$ biofilm structure and ecology, as revealed in experimental and clinical biofilm models. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of various Fusobacterium species on in vitro biofilm formation and structure in three different @di$ oral @/di$ biofilm models namely a supragingival, a supragingival ""feeding"", and a subgingival biofilm model."	1
Fusobacterium species, previously associated with both @di$ RA @/di$ and periodontal disease, were confirmed to be more prevalent in @di$ eRA @/di$ patients. Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii was 2.2-fold more common, and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum was more abundant in @di$ eRA @/di$ patients than in healthy controls. Additional bacteria associated with @di$ eRA @/di$ and known to be linked to periodontal disease were in the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Fretibacterium genera. Whether these species are causally associated with @di$ RA @/di$ or are a biomarker for periodontal disease linked to @di$ RA @/di$ remains to be evaluated, as is the increased abundance and prevalence of Campylobacter species. Nonetheless, the results of this study are in line with our previous finding that periodontal disease is associated with prospective @di$ RA @/di$ development and other published studies on early @di$ RA @/di$.	1
GA is believed to reduce the secretion of pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IFNgamma, TNF) released by TH1 cells, activate TH2 suppressor cells to express anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, TGF-beta) in the CNS and increase the enrichments of Tregs. GA, however, has also been shown to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota in MS patients elevating the proportion of Janthinobacterium while decreasing the presence of Eubacterium and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, suggesting the a putative bidirectional interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune mechanisms involved in MS.	2
GBS is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical ascending @di$ paralysis @/di$ with areflexia or hyporeflexia triggered by certain infections, such as @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$, cytomegalovirus, M.	1
GI Infection was dominated by bacteria 64.4%, followed by an equal incidence of parasite and @di$ viral infection @/di$ [Figure 1]. Overall, G. lamblia, Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), @gm$ Shigella @/gm$/Enterotoxigenic E.	1
Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genoa, Italy, were identified seven episodes due to unusual pathogens: Bacillus circulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Brevibacterium casei, Flavimonas oryzihabitans, @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, Comamonas acidovorans and Agrobacterium radiobacter. Susceptibility to different antibiotics of all strains are reported. In all cases catheter removal was required for culture negativization. All episodes were diagnosed in absence of @di$ granulocytopenia @/di$.	0
Gene expression of cd36 is down-regulated during @di$ infection @/di$ of zebrafish with @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$, whereas knockdown of cd36 in zebrafish larvae led to higher bacterial burden upon such @di$ infection @/di$.	1
Genomic sequence-based phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that Ko3 and Ko4 formed well-defined sequence clusters related to, but distinct from, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (Ko1), K. oxytoca (Ko2), K. huaxiensis (Ko8), and K. grimontii (Ko6). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) of Ko3 and Ko4 were 90.7% with K. huaxiensis and 95.5% with K. grimontii, respectively. In addition, three strains of K. huaxiensis, a species so far described based on a single strain from a @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$ patient in China, were isolated from cattle and human feces.	0
Given that different species from the same genus may respond differently to the same intervention, it is necessary to identify responses to @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ treatment at the species level. By further using LEfSe to classify the most specific species, we found that B. adolescentis was the top hit, followed by L. reuteri and A. muciniphila. Due to their beneficial effects on human health, B. adolescentis and L. reuteri are widely used as probiotics. Animal studies have previously reported that B. longum CCFM687 supplementation can prevent the onset of depression due to chronic stress, while @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ CCFMCCFM1025 administration was found to exert antidepressant-like effects. Randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated that Bifidobacterium intervention improved cognitive decline in those with MCI and severe @di$ dementia @/di$. Taken together with the improved cognitive function we observed for specific @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ strains, large-scale, multi-center clinical trials may be warranted in the future to identify the specific effect of probiotics on AD patients at different stages of the disease, particularly in the context of the early onset of AD.	1
Given the increasing prevalence of hypertension and presence of primary diseases of poverty in China, anaerobic bacterial infection should be considered in differential diagnosis for patients with hypertension who present with @di$ gastrointestinal hemorrhage @/di$. The early prevention and control of primary diseases can reduce the occurrence and development of anaerobic bloodstream infection. Furthermore, two or more sets of blood culture greatly improves the positive test rate of blood cultures of anaerobic bacteria, and identification through mass spectrometry can play a role in @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ diagnosis.	0
Given the increasing prevalence of some nontarget organisms in @di$ BSI @/di$ cases, such as K. variicola and @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp., inclusion of capture probes for these organisms will greatly improve the applicability of the Verigene test in our region.	0
Giving @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ (@gm$ Cj @/gm$), a common cause of acute human gastroenteritis, as an example of an important foodborne pathogen that targets different host niches with different metal challenges, how @gm$ Cj @/gm$ adapts to different metal stresses within its different hosts was described. Exploring the functions and mechanisms of the zinc handling systems in @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ will expand our understanding of how they contribute to infections. Zinc deficiency is linked to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, such as Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus:GAS), a Gram-positive human pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from pharyngitis and @di$ impetigo @/di$, to severe invasive diseases including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome.	0
Gram-negative bacteria constituted about 80.3% and 76.9% of the total isolate in @di$ diabetic @/di$ and non-@di$ diabetic @/di$ group respectively, while the remaining was gram-positive. Few isolates of fungi candida spp. were also reported from each group. In both groups, E. coli, followed by K. pneumoniae were most common isolates. However, it is interesting to note that the third most common gram-negative isolate was different, i.e., P. aeruginosa in @di$ diabetic @/di$ group and Proteus spp. in non-@di$ diabetic @/di$ group. Most common gram-positive isolates included S. aureus, followed by coagulase negative staphylococcus and @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ in both the groups. Rarely other bacteria consisting of S. agalactiae S. saprophyticus were also found. @di$ Diabetic @/di$ patients also revealed a greater frequency of candida infection than non-@di$ diabetics @/di$.	0
Grass carp suffers from many bacterial diseases, and studies have demonstrated that @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ causes bacterial enteritis and furunculosis, Aeromonas sobria causes peduncle disease, Aeromonas hydrophila is the pathogen of bacterial septicemia, Pseudomonas fluorescens is responsible for @di$ red skin disease @/di$, and Flavobacterium columnare is the etiology of columnaris disease and white head-mouth disease.	0
Graves' disease (GD) is an @di$ autoimmune disorder @/di$ that frequently results in hyperthyroidism and other symptoms. Here, we designed a 6-month study with patients divided into three treatment groups, namely, methimazole (MI, n = 8), MI + black bean (n = 9) and MI + probiotic @gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$ (n = 9), to evaluate the curative effects of probiotics supplied with MI on thyroid function of patients with GD through clinical index determination and intestinal microbiota metagenomic sequencing.	2
H121, Romboutsia ilealis, Burkholderiales bacterium YL45, @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, Duncaniella sp. PC9, Duncaniella sp. B8, Muribaculum intestinale, and Lactobacillus johnsonii), and 9 were found at increased abundances (Lactobacillus sp. P38, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Ligilactobacillus animalis, and 6 Alistipes species). A closer look at the random forest analysis (Fig. 4A-F; Fig. S2) shows some concordance between the top variables of importance that are responsible for the separation by genotype and sex, including Turicibacter sp. H121 and Lactobacillus johnsonii. This agreement may be the reflection of a sex-specific difference in @di$ AD @/di$-pathology manifesting as differential microbial dysbiosis.	1
HTGAP group also had poorer microbial diversity, higher abundances of Escherichia/Shigella and Enterococcus, but lower abundances of @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, Blautia wexlerae, and Bacteroides ovatus as compared with non-HTGAP group. Correlation analysis revealed that gut bacterial taxonomic and functional changes were linked with local and systemic complications, ICU admission, and mortality. This study revealed that alterations of gut microbiota were associated with disease severity and poor prognosis in HTGAP patients, indicating a potential pathophysiological link between gut microbiota and @di$ hypertriglyceridemia @/di$ related acute pancreatitis.	1
HUS is characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and @di$ thrombocytopenia @/di$. In 2011 an outbreak of @gm$ STEC O104:H4 @/gm$ associated disease occurred in Germany.	1
He continued to have back pain, although without @di$ fever @/di$, hypotension, respiratory complaints, or neurologic abnormalities. On hospital day (HD) 4, the Gram-positive bacilli were identified as Clostridium perfringens and @gm$ Paeniclostridium sordellii @/gm$ (formerly @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$), follow-up blood cultures yielded Gram-variable bacilli.	1
He was not correctly diagnosed until he experienced a @di$ stroke @/di$ and a blood culture revealed @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$ weeks later. This case and our detailed review of related cases highlight the importance of thorough medical history-taking and clinical evaluations. Brain abscess formation should be considered in previously healthy patients with fever, @di$ stroke @/di$, and a recent history of tooth extraction.	1
Hence, a decrease in the relative abundances of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species in the human colon has been associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, IBS, IBD, @di$ obesity @/di$, allergies, and regressive autism (Di Gioia et al.,; Grimm et al.,). Examples of functions carried out by bifidobacteria include the production and/or liberation of B vitamins, antioxidants, polyphenols, and conjugated linoleic acids; maturation of the immune system during early life and preservation of immune homeostasis during life; preservation of gut barrier functions and protection against pathogens by producing bacteriocins, decreasing luminal pH by the production of acids, and blocking the adhesion of pathogens to the intestinal mucosa (Leahy et al.,; Gorissen et al.,; Rossi and Amaretti,; Gagnon et al.,). However, these functions are not characteristic for the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus or certain species, but are rather strain-specific.	2
Her hospital course was complicated by polymicrobial @di$ sepsis @/di$ (S. faecalis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Citrobacter diversus, @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$, and unidentified gram-negative bacilli #2) requiring vancomycin and gentamicin therapy.	1
Here we describe the case of a 16-year-old male who presented with fever, @di$ neck pain @/di$, and odynophagia and was ultimately diagnosed with an atypical variant of Lemierre's disease secondary to @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, a rarely described etiologic pathogen.	1
Here we describe the case of a woman with @di$ pyelonephritis @/di$ and bacteremia in which @gm$ Lactobacillus delbrueckii @/gm$ was determined to be the causative agent.	1
Here, the influence of three-species oral microbial consortium on growth, virulence, invasion and persistence in dendritic cells (DCs) was examined experimentally in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in patients with @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (@di$ PD @/di$). Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs. @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ was only taken up by DCs when in consortium with P. gingivalis. Mature consortium regressed DC maturation upon uptake, as determined by flow cytometry. Analysis of dental plaques of @di$ PD @/di$ and healthy subjects by 16s rRNA confirmed oral colonization with consortium members, but DC hematogenous spread was limited to P. gingivalis and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$. Expression of P. gingivalis mfa1 fimbriae was increased in dental plaques and hematogenous DCs of @di$ PD @/di$ patients. P. gingivalis in the consortium correlated with an adverse clinical response in the gingiva of @di$ PD @/di$ subjects.	1
Here, we characterized a @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ strain that was isolated from a patient with a @di$ renal abscess @/di$.	1
Here, we observe that the modified jejunoileal bypass effectively decreases body weight @di$ gain @/di$, fasting blood glucose, and lipids level in serum; additionally, islet beta-cell function, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance were markedly ameliorated. The hypoglycemic effect and the improvement in islet beta-cell function depend on the changes in gut microbiota structure. modified jejunoileal bypass increases the abundance of gut Escherichia coli and Ruminococcus gnavus and the levels of serum glycine, histidine, and glutamine in T2DM rats; and decreases the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ and the levels of serum branched chain amino acids, which are significantly related to the improvement of islet beta-cell function in T2DM rats.	2
Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and @di$ class-I obesity @/di$ to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework. RESULTS: Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced alpha-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Blautia obeum @/gm$, and Prevotella copri.	0
Herein, we describe the case of a 39-year-old stock breeder with a history of recurrent episodes of bacteremia caused by @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ over a period of 3 years. Two months after the last episode of bacteremia, he presented with mild @di$ renal insufficiency @/di$, nephrotic range proteinuria, and microscopic hematuria.	1
Herein, we report an unusual case of @di$ liver abscess @/di$ caused by @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$ that has not been previously reported.	1
High prevalence of @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ in human population, as well as its low immunogenic potential, suggests this species is a typical commensal gut microbe. The same finding was reported for M. luminyensis. In fact, M. luminyensis was shown to be able to degrade trimethylamine (TMA), a compound associated with @di$ metabolic disorders @/di$ such as trimethylaminuria, as well as reducing trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) plasma levels, preventing the development of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases.	2
His past history revealed: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), @di$ systemic hypertension @/di$ and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been treated with oral prednisolone (60 mg gl-1) for 8 days due to a presumed exacerbation of his COPD. Sequentially, he developed haemoptysis, chest tightness, frequent wheezing and worsening cough. Bronchoscopy showed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage; microbiological examination of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was recommended. Examination of an acid fast bacilli stain preparation of BAL revealed filariform larvae of Strongyloides. Stool specimen examination revealed larvae of Strongyloides. The physical condition of the patient began to deteriorate; a few days after admission, vancomycin-sensitive @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ was isolated from a blood sample. He was treated with ivermectin and albendazole for strongyloides and linezolid plus vancomycin for @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$.	0
Histology shows clumps of acid fast bacilli in areas of subcutaneous @di$ fatty necrosis @/di$ with acute and chronic inflammation remote from the necrotic areas. Granulomas are found in later lesions. This histopathology led to the suggestion that Mu causes disease by secretion of a toxin which can destroy human tissue and inhibit the development of local inflammation. Subsequently it was found that @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ culture filtrate could produce similar lesions after injection into guinea pig skin.	1
Histopathological analysis showed @di$ edematous @/di$ and necrotic lesions (Figure 2A) already established in the footpad tissue when the RS treatment was initiated. As previously described in @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ progressing lesions from humans and mice, necrosis was surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly by macrophages and neutrophils (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C, 3C and 3D). These necrotic areas contained clumps of extracellular bacilli (Figure 2D), whereas in peripheral infiltrates intracellular bacteria were predominantly seen (Figure 2E). Extensive @di$ edema @/di$ was also evident (Figure 2A and 1A).	1
How do mouse intestinal flora change before and after constipation, and after supplementation with @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$? The results clearly showed that the composition of the gut microbiota community both before and after intervention was dominated by two phyla, Bacteroidetes (which includes Bacteroides and Odoribacter) and Firmicutes (which includes Clostridium, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Dorea), whereas Actinobacteria (mainly Bifidobacterium), Proteobacteria and Tenericutes played minor roles. In general, at the phylum level, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes increased and the abundance of other phyla decreased in the @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ treatment groups. Similarly, at the genus level, @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ did not increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium in Actinobacteria but did increase the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in Firmicutes and reduced the abundance of Clostridium. Some species of the Clostridium genera are associated with the emergence of intestinal complications such as @di$ colitis @/di$, necrotizing enterocolitis and gastroenteritis. Therefore, the reduction of harmful Clostridium after @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ ingestion indicates a potential benefit for gut health.	2
However, BV is characterized by a decrease in beneficial vaginal bacteria, such as Lactobacillus cripatus, and by an increase of the number of anaerobic bacteria, such as @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$, Mobiluncus mulieris, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella bivia and Fusobacteria nucleatum. BV is typically a polymicrobial condition. Recently it has been found that multi-species microbial biofilms are involved in BV; however, the process by which this multi-species biofilm is established remains unknown. In general, single-species biofilm formation involves two main independent steps: initial adhesion to the surface and biofilm accumulation. In contrast, multi-species biofilm formation may be more complex and depend upon interactions between the species involved. The most thoroughly studied clinically relevant polymicrobial biofilm is the oral biofilm associated with @di$ periodontitis @/di$. During the development of these biofilms, early colonizers first adhere to the tooth pellicle and provide a surface to which intermediate colonizers can adhere as well as producing more optimal conditions for growth of successive species. This community in turn provides an environment conducive to the adherence and growth of secondary colonizers. Similar to oral biofilms, it has been hypothesized that @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ is the initial colonizing species and that @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ biofilms are conducive to growth, adherence and/or biofilm formation by other BV anaerobes, but this has yet to be demonstrated.	1
However, as with other medically important gram-positive, non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli, @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ is difficult to culture and identify in microbiology laboratories for many reasons. They are fastidious, slow growing, and phenotypically labor intensive to speciate; sometimes it may take 2 to 6 weeks for identification. For our patient, the gram stain of @di$ purulent liver abscess @/di$ aspirate was negative and required 6 days to return a positive culture and 2 more days for further identification. Most often cultured from polymicrobial sources such as the gastrointestinal and genital tracts, @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ is also frequently overgrown by less fastidious, aerobic organisms. The paucity of cases of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ infections likely reflects the above difficulties, in addition to the postulated low pathogenicity of the organism.	1
However, bifidobacteria have also been isolated from the human oral cavity, where their presence is linked to the progression of @di$ tooth decay @/di$: bifidobacteria have been detected in high numbers in infected dentine from @di$ carious lesions @/di$ in children and have been associated with childhood @di$ dental caries @/di$. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ can be found as part of the microbiota implicated in human @di$ dental caries @/di$. In recent surveys of oral bifidobacteria associated with @di$ coronal caries @/di$ in adults and children and root caries in adults, @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ was the most frequently isolated Bifidobacterium species, representing approximately eight percent of the culturable bacteria isolated from active @di$ carious lesions @/di$. This species is capable of acidogenesis to produce a final pH in glucose-containing media below pH 4.2, sufficient to cause extensive demineralisation of tooth tissues. @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ may therefore significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of @di$ dental caries @/di$ which is one of the most common chronic diseases, remaining untreated in many underdeveloped countries where dental pain is often alleviated only by the loss or extraction of the affected tooth.	1
"However, confident diagnosis of ancient @di$ septicemia @/di$ solely on the basis of historical clinical observations is not possible. The lack of suitable infected material has prevented direct demonstration of ancient @di$ septicemia @/di$; thus, the history of most infections such as plague remains hypothetical. The durability of dental pulp, together with its natural sterility, makes it a suitable material on which to base such research. We hypothesized that it would be a lasting refuge for @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$, the plague agent. DNA extracts were made from the dental pulp of 12 unerupted teeth extracted from skeletons excavated from 16th and 18th century French graves of persons thought to have died of plague (""plague teeth"") and from 7 ancient negative control teeth. PCRs incorporating ancient DNA extracts and primers specific for the human beta-globin gene demonstrated the absence of inhibitors in these preparations. The incorporation of primers specific for @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ rpoB (the RNA polymerase beta-subunit-encoding gene) and the recognized virulence-associated pla (the plasminogen activator-encoding gene) repeatedly yielded products that had a nucleotide sequence indistinguishable from that of modern day isolates of the bacterium."	1
However, epidemiological studies suggested that latent infection of the low-virulence anaerobic bacteria, especially the @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$, had a strong correlation with @di$ disc degeneration @/di$, Modic changes, sciatica, and low back pain. For example, some clinical studies have demonstrated that antibiotic therapy targeting the bacteria significantly reduced the low back pain and Modic changes in patients. In addition, inoculation of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ into normal intervertebral discs of rats or rabbits induced severe @di$ disc degeneration @/di$ and Modic changes. For this reason, @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ is thought to be involved in a previously undiscovered pathogeny for series of @di$ disc diseases @/di$.	1
However, his exposure history of contact with brackish water accompanied by a short incubation time from acupuncture to symptom onset was highly suggestive of NF due to @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$. The patient denied any injury prior to acupuncture, this implies that @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ may have survived on the skin for at least one day before the acupuncture. The prolonged survival of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ on the skin has been previously demonstrated by other authors from Israel. To date, only three other cases of NF associated with acupuncture have been reported in the English literature, the causative pathogens in these cases were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative rods. Acupuncture associated infections due to vibrios have been reported only once, in non-English literature, the report described a Korean patient suffering from @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ who developed non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholera septicemia following acupuncture.	1
However, in another animal study when compared to placebo, acarbose displayed a higher abundance of @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ 2 and Lactobacillus and decrease the species Akkermansia muciniphila . In a human study, after treatment with acarbose, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species thrived with depletion of the original gut microbiota including Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Clostridium. In a clinical study, acarbose was found to increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which correlated inversely with changes in HbA1c and body weight. At the genus level, acarbose decreased the abundance of Bacteroides and at a species level, Bacteroides plebeius, Bacteroides dorei/vulgatus, and Clostridium bolteae. In a randomized trial, acarbose treatment increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and Enterococcus faecalis in patients with T2D. However, these results might have been confounded by its co-administration with metformin and other glucose-lowering drugs which could also alter the diversity of microbiota. In people with prediabetes, compared to placebo, treatment with acarbose increased abundance of Lactobacillus and Dialister and reduced abundance of Butyricicoccus, Phascolarctobacterium, and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$. However, the study did not differentiate between @di$ IFG @/di$ and IGT.	0
However, in mice with @di$ colitis @/di$ (DSS group), the relative abundance of butyrate-producing microbes including Lachnospiraceae (Figure 4(e)), and E. ventriosum, @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$, and R. hominis (Figure 4(h)), as well as the production of butyrate (Figure 6(b)) decreased significantly, and thus, epithelial PPAR-gamma signaling was reduced (Figure 7(c-d)). Nitrate levels would be increased in the colonic lumen because the epithelial expression of Nos2, the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was elevated (figure 7(f)) with a decrease in PPAR-gamma signaling (Figure 7(c-d)). Meanwhile, colonocytes switch their energy metabolism to the conversion of glucose into lactate, and metabolic polarization of colonocytes toward anaerobic glycolysis is accompanied by elevated iNOS synthesis (Figure 7(c,e)). In agreement with these data, elevated colonic epithelial oxygenation (Figure 7(a-b), DSS) promoted a dysbiotic expansion of potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 4(e)) in mice with @di$ colitis @/di$. The anaerobic environment of the intestinal cavity is broken. Fortunately, HS administration significantly inhibited the reduction of PPAR-gamma signaling (Figure 7(c-d)) and reduced the expression of Nos2 (Figure 7(f)) and iNOS (Figure 7(c,e)), thereby inhibiting the concentration of lactate and nitrate and the expansion of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in the colonic lumen (Figure 4(e)). Therefore, HS administration activated epithelial PPAR-gamma by increasing the abundance of butyrate-producing microbes and the production of butyrate which participates in the metabolic reprogramming of colonocytes, decreases colonocyte oxygenation during @di$ colitis @/di$, and thus maintains colonocyte hypoxia (Figure 7(a-b), DSS+H2), thereby promoting the transition from a dysbiotic community to a homeostatic community in the colonic lumen of mice with @di$ colitis @/di$.	2
However, mixtures of bison and cattle rumen inoculum improved straw and total @di$ DM @/di$ and aNDF disappearances as compared to either bison or cattle rumen inoculum alone. These results suggest possible synergistic effects of the mixture of cattle and bison inoculum on @di$ DM @/di$ and aNDF degradation of straw based diets. Synergy has been previously reported in pure cultures when a non-fibrolytic @gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$ strain was co-cultured with either F.	0
However, necrosis and @di$ hypoxia @/di$, key features of human tuberculosis lesions, are lacking in conventional mouse strains. METHODS: We used C3HeB/FeJ mice, which develop necrotic lesions in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Positron emission tomography in live infected animals, postmortem pimonidazole immunohistochemistry, and bacterial gene expression analyses were used to assess whether tuberculosis lesions in C3HeB/FeJ are hypoxic. Efficacy of combination drug treatment, including PA-824, active against @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$ under hypoxic conditions, was also evaluated. RESULTS: Tuberculosis lesions in C3HeB/FeJ (but not BALB/c) were found to be hypoxic and associated with up-regulation of known @di$ hypoxia @/di$-associated bacterial genes (P < .001).	1
However, none of them were more active than the enzyme of @gm$ B. methanolicus @/gm$, which has been used in previous studies. This was probably due to the fact that all the known @di$ HPS @/di$ enzymes are relatively similar and thus the ability of the algorithm to find different types of enzymes is limited.	0
However, on-going large neonatal studies, including the UK-based PiPS trial of @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ BBG, will include analyses of impact of probiotics on @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ and gastrointestinal colonization by resistant organisms.	0
However, probiotic bacteria products available in the market contain only a few easy-to-grow strains from the @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium genera, which constitute only a small fraction of the gut microbiome. To restore the overall loss in microbial diversity caused as a result of either @di$ gut dysbiosis @/di$ or malnutrition, it is essential to reconstitute the gut microflora by administering multiple strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that belong to other phyla of human gut microbes.	2
However, several bacteria relevant to human health with CR, including @gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Enterococcus durans, Acinetobacter junii, A. johnsonii, Microbacterium lacus, and S. maltophilia, have been found in coastal seawater in Australia. These species have been found to cause human infections, such as bacteraemia (Acinetobacter junii, A. johnsonii, @gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$, and Brevundimonas vesicularis), meningitis (P. fulva), endocarditis (E. durans), @di$ cellulitis @/di$, soft tissue, urinary and respiratory tract infections (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Microbacterium lacus), and eye infections (S.	1
However, some bacteria potentially associated to @di$ halitosis @/di$, such as Fusobacterium or Prevotella, are highly diverse, and the search for potential disease or health biomarkers should therefore be performed at lower taxonomic levels. At species level, an unclassified Prevotella sp., Streptococcus parasanguinis, Veillonella dispar, Veillonella atypica, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella histicola, an unclassified Veillonella sp., Streptoccocus salivarius, Rothia mucilaginosa, @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ and an unclassified Tannerella sp.	1
However, studies on the differentiation of the composition of the intestinal microflora in patients with urinary stones have shown that antibiotic therapy promotes the development of @di$ urolithiasis @/di$ not only due to the reduction of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ colonization, but also by modifying the composition of the entire intestinal microflora. The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, harboring a large number of species, including bacteria metabolizing oxalate that build complex functional networks among each other. Typically, the gut plays an important role in the metabolism of oxalate, which lowers the risk of kidney stone formation. The relationship between the gut and kidneys is called the gut-kidney axis. The importance of the gut-kidney axis in the development of @di$ urolithiasis @/di$ is emphasized by the fact that hyperoxaluria, observed in the course of @di$ urolithiasis @/di$, may increase intestinal permeability. Disturbances in the intestinal microflora that accompany @di$ urolithiasis @/di$ can induce damage to the intestinal barrier. Increased intestinal permeability promotes the translocation of bacterial waste products that induce a response to the developing inflammation in the intestinal and urinary tract. A previous analysis showed that people who form kidney stones were characterized by microbial dysbiosis, including an abnormal abundance of eubacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and even fungi. In addition to @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$, research to date has also indicated the insufficiency of Ruminococcus and Oscillospira as causes of abnormal oxalate homeostasis in the gut.	2
However, the FV-induced abundance of health-promoting bacteria detected was likely due to more complex non-digestible plant fiber (also known as non-digestible polysaccharides) and polyphenols that are abundant in fruits and vegetables and have compelling evidence from preclinical studies to modulate @di$ gut dysbiosis @/di$ in metabolic disorders and reduce associated immune system dysregulation or modulate the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria after a high adherence to enriched fruit and vegetable diets. In humans, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ degrade plant fibers and produce acetate and succinate as major end products.	2
However, the cattle tested were suspected clinical cases of brucellosis, most likely due to natural exposure to virulent @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ field strains. Cattle that have been vaccinated with B. abortus S19 or sheep with @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ Rev 1 between 3 and 6 months are usually considered to be @di$ infected @/di$ if the sera give positive fixation at a titre of 30 or greater ICFTU/ml when the animals are tested at an age of 18 months or older (OIE, 2013a).	1
However, the relative abundance of gut microbiota between @di$ dementia @/di$ and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in AD is not well studied. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to identify differentially enriched gut microbes and their metabolic pathways in AD patients with @di$ dementia @/di$ comparing to AD patients with MCI. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan and analyzed by whole metagenomic sequencing technique. For normal controls without AD (NC), 16S rRNA sequencing was obtained from the Taiwan Microbiome Database. A total of 48 AD (38 @di$ dementia @/di$ and 10 MCI defined by cognitive function scores) and 50 NC were included. Microbiome alpha and beta diversities were estimated. Differentially enriched microbes were identified with HAllA, MaAsLin, DESeq2, and LEfSe statistical modeling approaches. RESULTS: We found significantly increased abundance of Firmicutes but decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes at phylum level in AD compared to NC. In AD patients, cognitive function scores were negatively associated with abundance of Blautia hydrogenotrophica (Firmicutes), Anaerotruncus colihominis (Firmicutes), and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$ (Actinobacteria). In addition, microbial abundance in the sucrose and S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) metabolic pathways was more enriched in AD with MCI than AD with @di$ dementia @/di$ and significantly associated with higher cognitive function scores. CONCLUSION: Gut microbe community diversity was similar in AD patients regardless of MCI or @di$ dementia @/di$ status.	1
However, the results are consistent with those generated by other investigators, who also compared the performance of PCR versus blood culture for identification of @di$ sepsis @/di$ causative pathogens, suggesting that these findings may apply to other patient cohorts as well. Our current version of @di$ Sepsis@Quick @/di$ assay cannot detect fungi and other bacterial pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida spp., Burkholderia spp., A. hydrophilia, @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$, M. morgani, E. aerogenes/cloacae, M. morganii and S. marcescens. This may partially explain the lack of DNA amplification in about 14% of episodes, whereas blood culture was still able to show growth. Hence, inclusion of more pathogens into the future forms of @di$ Sepsis@Quick @/di$ is needed to improve the pathogenic detection spectrum.	0
However, there are controversies in the literature regarding the proportion of Actinobacteria in response to @di$ inflammation @/di$ making it challenging to unravel its biological implications. For example, Bifidobacterium spp are considered as dominant bugs presenting anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties, but other genera probably might play essential roles in the gut as well. In our work, we identified two genera of Actinobacteria being significantly influenced during mucositis. A reduced proportion of Adlercreutzia was observed in mice receiving 5-FU suggesting its niche is essential for avoiding a dysbiosis state. The decreased abundance of Adlercreutzia has been previously reported in cases of colitis patients compared to control group, and in another clinical study, patients have shown a reduced proportion after chemotherapy submission. Interestingly, this genus is currently formed by one species, @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$, which produces an isoflavone metabolite, named equol, with anti-cancerous and anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties.	2
However, to our knowledge, this is the first Western study focusing on the prognostic role of gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, and inflammation in patients with cirrhosis and @di$ HCC @/di$ receiving ICIs and on their longitudinal evolution. A previous study analyzed the gut microbiota of 8 Asian patients with @di$ HCC @/di$ treated with anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, and demonstrated that @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ among other bacteria was associated with treatment response.	1
However, towards the end of the last decade, it was observed that @di$ fever @/di$ took longer time than before to clear, and at times surprisingly failed to respond to ciprofloxacin therapy. These isolates had comparatively higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of fluoroquinolones, although they were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by conventional disc diffusion testing and recommended MIC breakpoints. Nevertheless, such strains of @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ are resistant to nalidixic acid and it was noted that clinical response to fluoroquinolones in patients infected with nalidixic acid-resistant @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ (NARST) was inferior to the response in those infected with nalidixic acid-sensitive @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ (NASST) strains.	1
"However, we acknowledge the fact that the small number of positive patients in this study did not enable us to draw any conclusion on the exact role and distribution of methanogenic archaeae in refractory @di$ sinusitis @/di$. Indeed, present study was not properly designed to address the important question of the relative role of methanogens in chronic @di$ sinusitis @/di$ as it was a retrospective study which eventually included only one-culture-positive patient. This patient has not received antibiotics known to be effective against @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$. Altogether, these observations did not allow for an accurate interpretation of the relative role of methanogens in the pathology. In addition, their isolation is an insufficient criterion to prove their pathogenicity. Refractory @di$ sinusitis @/di$ is acknowledged as a condition linked to mixed infections and the present cases confirm @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$, M. smithii, and ""M. massiliense"" as three additional microorganisms linked to this disease. Moreover, the presence of methanogenic archaea in sinuses fills an anatomical gap between methanogen-associated brain abscess and oral pathologies linked to @gm$ M. oralis @/gm$ including severe periodontitis and peri-implantitis and endodontic infections."	1
However, whether the extracts have beneficial effects on @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ has so far remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-bacterial effects of Dios on Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ (@gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$) in vitro. The anti-microbial effect of Dios on P. gingivalis and @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ was assessed by a direct contact test (DCT) and the Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay at 60, 90 and 120 min. In addition, counting of colony-forming units (CFU) and live/dead cell staining were used to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects. The results of the DCT and CCK-8 assays indicated that Dios had beneficial dose-dependent inhibitory effects on P. gingivalis and @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$. The CFU counting results also indicated that Dios had dose-dependent anti-bacterial effects on P. gingivalis and @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$. Of note, Dios had significant anti-bacterial effects on the biofilms of P. gingivalis and @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ in vitro as visualized by the live/dead cell staining method. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that Dios had a marked anti-bacterial activity against P. gingivalis and @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ in vitro, both in suspension and on biofilms. The present study highlighted the potential applications of Dios as a novel natural agent to prevent and treat @di$ periodontitis @/di$ through its anti-bacterial effects.	2
Human Salmonella infection, in particular, @di$ typhoid fever @/di$ is a highly infectious disease that remains a major public health problem causing significant morbidity and mortality. The outcome of these infections depends on the host's immune response, particularly the actions of granulocytes and macrophages. Using a mouse model of human @di$ typhoid fever @/di$, with Salmonella typhimurium infection of wild type and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) knock out mice we show a delay in the onset of immune-mediated tissue damage in the spleens and livers of GM-CSF(-/-) mice. Furthermore, GM-CSF(-/-) mice have a prolonged sequestration of @gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ in affected tissues despite an increased production of F4/80+ effector cells.	1
Human brucellosis, a common zoonotic disease, is a neglected, under-recognized @di$ infection @/di$ of widespread geographic distribution and globally about 500,000 cases occur annually. The highest incidence of human brucellosis is recorded in the Middle East and Central Asia. It is among the most commonly reported infectious diseases in Kuwait and the other countries of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The organisms causing brucellosis belong to genus Brucella, and the disease in humans is primarily caused by three species, i.e. B. melitensis, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ or B.	1
Human can also be infected, mainly through animal-to-person spread, in which case long-lasting @di$ flu-like symptoms @/di$ are observed. Like tuberculosis, brucellosis is a global problem, since it is the most common bacterial infection spread from animals to humans worldwide. After the recent identification of the species B. vulpis, a total of eleven species have been identified within the genus Brucella according to their pathogenicity and preferential animal host, among which the six classically recognized species are: B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, B.	1
"Human infection follows contact with fish or contaminated water and is often described as ""swimming pool @di$ granuloma @/di$"" or ""fish tank @di$ granuloma @/di$"". It usually occurs in the upper extremities and presents as cutaneous nodules or plaques with or without ulceration, occasionally with a sporotrichoid pattern. Despite an increase in the number of cases in recent years, M. marinum infection is often unrecognized or misdiagnosed as fungal or tuberculosis infection due to nonspecific lesions and atypical histopathology. Diagnosis of M. marinum infection is usually based on isolation of M. marinum. However, culture of @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ is very time-consuming, taking several weeks to produce positive results."	1
Human intestine-on-a-chip or human gut-on-a-chip (hGoC) have already been used to model invasion or @di$ infection @/di$ by pathogenic entero-invasive E. coli strains into the commensal bacterial biofilm or the host intestinal endothelium, as well as to model Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium infections. Grassart et al. have successfully modeled the impact of flow and peristalsis on the human pathogen @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ within a 3D colonic epithelium using hGoC technology. The authors observed that @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ invasion accurately imitates what has been previously reported from clinical data. @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ was also shown to leverage the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This study is the proof-of-concept that we can use hGoCs to gain insights into @di$ infection @/di$ mechanisms of human-restricted pathogens and that such models could provide a viable alternative to animals, particularly where species differences can preclude accurate extrapolation to humans. In addition, some lactic acid bacteria have been used to model the presence or biochemical contribution of probiotics in human microbiota using hGoC models. Notably, it has been shown that the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG improved intestinal barrier function when co-cultured in the lumen of the intestinal epithelial channel of the hGoC, and that the VSL#3  probiotic formulation suppressed villus blunting and the loss of barrier function induced by @di$ infection @/di$ with pathogenic E.	1
Hyperuricemia induces @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$ and accelerates the progression of renal and cardiovascular diseases. Gut microbiota has been linked to the development of hyperuricemia through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that the abundance and centrality of @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ are depleted in subjects with hyperuricemia.	2
Hypocoprin A (1) showed antibacterial activity in disk assays against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ (@gm$ ATCC 6051 @/gm$), affording 13-14 mm inhibitory zones at 200 mug/disk (a gentamicin standard gave similar results at 20 mug/disk), but no effects against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) or Candida albicans (ATCC 14053) at this level. Hypocoprin C (3) showed only a 9 mm zone in the assay against Staph. aureus, while hypocoprin B (2) was inactive in all four assays. Hypocoprins A-C (1) were also tested for cytotoxicity against a human @di$ osteosarcoma @/di$ cell line (U2OS), but were found to be inactive (IC50 > 10 muM).	0
I-09 have not been previously thoroughly studied; however other species of @gm$ Campylobacter hominis @/gm$ and other Pseudomonas have been found to induce inflammation in other diseases such as @di$ gastroenteritis @/di$ lending support to our findings that they may modulate the host immune response to COVID-19.	1
INTERVENTIONS: All 8 patients were placed on a protocol using leeches (Hirudo medicinalis), intensive care unit monitoring, antithrombotic pharmacotherapy, frequent hematologic evaluation, blood transfusions as needed, and antibiotic prophylaxis for @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Flap salvage rate, number of leeches used per patient, time needed for inosculation, duration of intensive care unit admission, transfusion requirement per patient, and complications during leech therapy. RESULTS: All 8 flaps survived with the application of this protocol. An average of 215 leeches were used per patient, and the average time needed for inosculation was 6.6 days. The average duration in the intensive care unit was 9.6 days. The morbidity of our protocol was substantial, with intensive care unit psychosis, prerenal @di$ azotemia @/di$, and large transfusion requirements being the most frequent complications.	1
INTRODUCTION: The objective of the case report is to highlight the possibility of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ caused by atypical mycobacteria. Such an infection may simulate tuberculous bone infection and yet fail to respond to standard anti-tuberculous drug therapy. CLINICAL PICTURE: A 66-year-old man who suffered from diabetes mellitus presented with @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ of the right wrist, with extensive synovial swellings of the flexor tendon sheaths. The clinical features, radiological appearances and histology suggested a tuberculous infection, but subsequent culture grew an atypical @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$, @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$.	1
INTRODUCTION: The present report describes a case of sepsis due to @gm$ Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae @/gm$ in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia with no animal exposure, associated with concomitant bronchopneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old Caucasian man presented to an emergency room with a three-day history of chest pain, @di$ fever @/di$, cough with purulent sputum, chills and dyspnea. The patient had associated erythematous papules on the chest and enlarged axillary, submandibular, pectoral and supraclavicular lymph nodes, which regressed under treatment with penicillin. The patient was found to have sepsis without endocarditis caused by @gm$ E rhusiopathiae @/gm$, associated with bronchopneumonia that was induced by a double Gram-negative infection. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying-B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia may have favoured the development of bacteremia due to @gm$ E rhusiopathiae @/gm$, which occurred subsequent to glossitis in an immunocompromised host being treated with methylprednisolone and cladribine.	1
INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$. A secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. METHODS: Gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites from 15 patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$. Samples from each site category were pooled and IL-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites from patients with periodontitis and @di$ gingivitis @/di$. The total amount of IL-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites in both periodontitis (P = 0.018) and @di$ gingivitis @/di$ (P = 0.002) patients and was higher in @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites from periodontitis patients than in those from @di$ gingivitis @/di$ patients (P = 0.015). There were higher levels of @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites in both the periodontitis and @di$ gingivitis @/di$ patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Levels of IL-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$, even at sites with similar pocket depths. The presence of similar levels of red complex species in @di$ gingivitis @/di$ sites from periodontitis patients and from @di$ gingivitis @/di$ patients suggested that the higher levels of IL-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.	1
Identification of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species in highly contaminated animal feces and meat samples was studied by Gavini and coll.. The use of bifidobacteria as indicator of @di$ fecal contamination @/di$ along a sheep meat production chain was described by Delcenserie and coll.	1
IgG antibodies to the minor gangliosides GM1b and GalNAc-GD1a frequently are present in sera of Japanese patients with @di$ Guillain-Barre syndrome @/di$. The relationship between these autoantibodies and Campylobacter jejuni infection, the type of disease (@di$ acute motor axonal neuropathy @/di$ [AMAN], or @di$ acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy @/di$ [@di$ AIDP @/di$]) has yet to be established. Sera samples were obtained from 55 Chinese patients with clinically defined @di$ Guillain-Barre syndrome @/di$. An electrophysiology study showed nine @di$ AIDP @/di$, 28 had AMAN, and 18 unclassified. @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ serology was positively correlated with anti-GM1b and anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG antibodies (respective P values, 0.007 and 0.02). The frequencies of positive anti-GM1b and anti-GalNAc-GD1a serology were greater in AMAN (32 and 21%) than in @di$ AIDP @/di$ (11 and 0%), but the differences were not significant. Infection by @gm$ C. jejuni @/gm$ may induce IgG anti-GM1b antibody in some patients and IgG anti-GalNAc-GD1a antibody in others.	1
Imaging revealed several @di$ liver abscesses @/di$, as well as extensive right pleural empyema. Sixteen weeks previously, the patient underwent tooth extraction of the third molars (18, 28, 38, 48) and a first molar (46), and systematic closed periodontitis treatment. Four different species of the physiological microbiota of the oral cavity were detected in the pleura or @di$ liver abscess @/di$ punctate (Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$). An underlying immune defect was ruled out. Ultrasound-guided drainage of @di$ liver abscesses @/di$ and surgical treatment of pleural empyema by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) and insertion of thoracic suction drains was performed, accompanied by targeted antibiotic therapy.	1
Importantly, our analysis highlighted candidate Mtb essential drug targets that are not essential in @gm$ Mk @/gm$. The lack of genetic requirement of the genes encoding these targets may have implications for the validation of drug candidates in the antitubercular drug development pipeline against @gm$ Mk @/gm$ and underscores physiological differences between @gm$ Mk @/gm$ and Mtb. Additional physiological differences between @gm$ Mk @/gm$ and Mtb are seen by comparing the genetic requirement of the genes of the ESX loci across species (Data set S8). The @gm$ Mk @/gm$ genome contains all five ESX loci present in the Mtb genome. For the most part, the genetic requirement of the loci is the same in @gm$ Mk @/gm$ and Mtb. The ESX-3 locus is involved in iron and zinc homeostasis and is the only locus identified as @di$ ES @/di$ for in vitro growth in both organisms. In contrast, the ESX-5 membrane component genes eccB5, eccC5, eccD5, and eccE5 were all identified as GD in Mtb but were classified as @di$ ES @/di$ in @gm$ Mk @/gm$. The ESX-5 locus has been shown to modulate the macrophage response in slow-growing M. marinum and appears to be the only cluster that is present in all slow-growing mycobacteria yet absent in all rapidly growing mycobacteria analyzed so far. An Mtb ESX-5 mutant in which eccD5 was inactivated has been generated and was shown to display a wide range of phenotypes, including impaired secretion of ESX-5 substrates, reduced cell wall integrity, increased sensitivity to hydrophilic antibiotics, and attenuated growth in two infection models. Our essentiality data suggest the phenotypic effects resulting from disruption of one of the ESX-5 membrane components are more severe in @gm$ Mk @/gm$ than in Mtb under in vitro conditions.	0
Importantly, three of these bacterial species, both Deferribacteres and one Firmicutes (@gm$ Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans @/gm$) had significantly higher abundance in Nod2 -/- HFD mice than in the other three groups of mice, thus showing the best correlation with @di$ obesity @/di$ and metabolic syndrome, since Nod2 -/- HFD mice was the only group with significantly higher @di$ obesity @/di$ and metabolic syndrome.	1
In 16 patients with @di$ pustulosis palmaris et plantaris @/di$ (@di$ PPP @/di$), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from Streptococcus, (S.) sanguis, @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ and S. mitis induced production of IL-6. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. However, no significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen in 13 donors without @di$ PPP @/di$. No significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the @di$ PPP @/di$ and non-@di$ PPP @/di$ subjects, when stimulated with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and pokeweed mitogen. In the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in purified T-cells. but not in B-cells. These data suggest that IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which T-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of @di$ PPP @/di$.	1
In 2010, investigators found that a dental hygienist who developed active pulmonary TB likely transmitted @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ to another DHCP who worked in the same practice location. The newly hired hygienist worked for several months in the dental practice while she was infectious because her @di$ TB @/di$ symptoms originally were misdiagnosed. This report highlights the importance of implementing a written @di$ TB infection @/di$ prevention and control plan that ensures baseline screening of new hires for active or latent @di$ TB @/di$ that uses a 2-step tuberculin skin test or a single blood assay for @gm$ M. tuberculosis @/gm$. In addition, DHCP should be trained to recognize the signs and symptoms suggestive of active @di$ TB disease @/di$.	1
In 2017, two studies explored the relationship between the gut microbiome and clinical outcomes of ICIs in advanced @di$ melanoma @/di$. Frankel et al. investigated the effect of the baseline gut microbiome on clinical outcomes in advanced @di$ melanoma @/di$ patients receiving Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), Nivolumab (anti-PD-1), and a combination of Ipilimumab + Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), and reported that an enrichment of @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ was higher in patients who responded to immunotherapy (responders) (n = 24) compared to those who did not (non-responders) (n = 15). Among Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) + Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) responders, they observed an enrichment of gut bacteria Fecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis, whereas Pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) responders displayed an enrichment of Dorea formicigenerans. Chaput et al. also explored the relationship between the baseline gut microbiome and clinical response and GI toxicities in patients receiving Ipilimumab (CTLA-4). They reported that a relative abundance of Fecalibacterium, Gemmiger, and Clostridium XIVa and a lower abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ were associated with longer PFS (p = 0.0039) and OS (p = 0.051).	2
In 41 patients with alcoholic liver disease, antibodies to 12 common @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$ O antigens (expressed as number of O antibody reactions with an agglutination titre of greater than or equal to 40) and to immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM were studied for 8 weeks. In 18 patients (8 with cirrhosis, 10 with @di$ fatty liver @/di$) who continued drinking during this period no significant changes were found. In 23 patients (11 with cirrhosis, 12 with @di$ fatty liver @/di$) who stopped or reduced drinking, a significant decrease in the levels of E. coli O antibodies and IgA was found (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). In these 41 patients and in an additional 43 patients with alcoholic liver disease the amount of E. coli O antibodies was compared with type of histological lesion. The levels of E. coli O antibodies were significantly higher in cirrhosis with alcoholic hepatitis (22 cases) than in cirrhosis without alcoholic hepatitis (17 cases) (p less than 0.05). In these 17 patients antibody levels were significantly higher than in 41 patients with @di$ fatty liver @/di$ without alcoholic hepatitis (p less than 0.02).	1
In @di$ Aden @/di$, the incidence of diarrhoea among infants and children is still high. The present work aimed at investigation of Shigelleae and Vibrionaceae as etiologic agents of enteric infections. Stool specimens obtained from 1056 children complaining of diarrhoea were cultured on plating media and on enrichment media. Suspected colonies were then serotyped and antibiotic sensitivity tests performed. Seven percent of the specimens were found positive for @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ strains. @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$ was the commonest, particularly serotypes 14 and 1. Two percent of specimens were positive for Vibrionaceae, Plesiomonas shigelloides had the highest frequency. Several @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ strains revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics, this was explained as due to a plasmid role.	1
In @di$ Type II-A @/di$ systems, Cas9 first binds to the PAM and then interrogates the DNA from 3' to 5'. The PAM identified for @gm$ B. merycicum @/gm$, 5'-NGG-3', is the same as the well-characterized Streptococus pyogenes PAM, and flanks the 3' edge of the protospacer (Figs 4 and 5, S1 Table).	0
In @di$ obesity @/di$ patients, the abundance of phylum of Firmutes and the ratio of Firmutes/Bacteroids were decreased compared to healthy individuals, and similar results were seen in rats fed HFD, indicating the dysbiosis existing in @di$ obesity @/di$ and hyperlipidemia patients. In the current study, LGA intervention decreased the abundance of phylum of Firmutes and the ratio of Firmutes/Bacteroids caused by the HFD. It was reported that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was markedly reduced in @di$ obese @/di$ individuals, and gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced body-weight gain and adiposity in mice. Parabacteroides distasonis alleviated @di$ obesity @/di$ and metabolic dysfunctions in HFD-fed mice. We found that LGA administration significantly elevated the relative abundance of the genera of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, which may contribute to its effect on improving hyperlipidemia. Of note, the relative abundance of @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ genus increased nearly 10-fold after LGA administration compared to PBS control. @gm$ Blautia producta @/gm$ has been shown to alleviate the progress of the non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). Since @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ possesses a series of potential probiotic properties involved in the improvement of metabolic and inflammatory diseases, it is proposed to be a potential probiotic. Thus, the observed alleviation in fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in HCD rats treated with LGA may be, in part, attributed to the increased @gm$ Blautia @/gm$.	2
In AN lambs, high abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$, Comamonas kerstersii, and Veillonella magna was revealed. It is noteworthy that the revealed AN:SE ratio in the abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ was over 7000. As previously reported, the challenge with E. coli F18 and K88 can reduce the relative abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ in pigs. Therefore, similar alterations in the abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ of lambs in this study may contribute to an important role rather than a simple increase in the abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ in the susceptibility of lambs to E. coli F17. Comamonas kerstersii is a Gram-negative bacterium closely related to human @di$ abdominal and urinary tract infections @/di$, and bacteraemia and could be an opportunistic pathogen in humans.	0
In EONS, which is typically associated with vertical transmission of pathogens from mother to child, the most common pathogens are GBS, Escherichia coli, CONS, Haemophilus influenzae, and @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$. In LONS, which is most commonly associated with iatrogenic or nosocomial infections, the most common pathogens are CONS, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Risk factors include central venous catheter use and other invasive medical devices as well as prolonged hospitalization. Other risk factors include @di$ preterm rupture of membranes @/di$, amnionitis, meconium aspiration, LBW, VLBW, ELBW, preterm birth, greater than three vaginal examinations during labor, fever in the mother during labor, or any other infection in the mother during labor.	1
In HFD induced @di$ hyperlipidemia @/di$ rats, the dominant gut bacteria were also Firmicutes and Bacteroides. Compared to the C group, the number of opportunistic pathogen such as gram-negative Bacteroides in the @di$ hyperlipidemia @/di$ model group increased significantly, and @gm$ akkermansia @/gm$, oscillospiraceae and lachnospiraceae, which are negatively related to obesity, on the contrary, decreased significantly. Through the analysis of gut microbiota level, we found that Akkermansia decreased markedly in the HFD M group, but increased after given GPs. As a symbiotic genus of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ contains only one member: @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$. @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ degrades mucin and is a rich member of the human intestinal microbiota. Colonization of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ has been reported to have a protective effect on diet-induced obesity, ability to promote mucosal wound healing, and can increase antitumor responses during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ inversely correlates with the onset of inflammation; it can adjust adipose tissue metabolism and metabolic disorder during obesity in mice. We also know that oscillospiraceae can produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which is beneficial for improving the metabolism of @di$ hyperlipidemia @/di$.	2
In Japan, @gm$ P shigelloides @/gm$ is a rare pathogen of mass food poisoning and a common cause of diarrhea in travelers from Southeast Asian countries. It generally causes self-limited gastroenteritis, which resolves in 2-3 days; however, it can cause extraintestinal infections especially in neonates or adults with immunocompromising conditions, such as @di$ hematological disorders @/di$ (thalassemia, sickle cell disease, leukemia), biliary tract disease, cirrhosis, asplenia, and iron overload conditions including hemochromatosis.	1
In PD patients, we identified @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ as significantly more abundant than in the control group. Previous studies have shown the abundance of genus @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ in Taiwanese CKD patients; however, for the first time species level identification via 16S rRNA sequencing has been done for this population. Another study reported the enrichment of genus @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ in HD patients. Studies with mouse models have shown a decrease in @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ in mouse gut microbiota after nephrectomy, proving the association of this bacteria with CKD. Another animal study identified enrichment of the @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ genus in rats with unilateral @di$ ureteral obstruction @/di$, which is a general cause of renal impairment and can lead to tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and eventually irreversible renal injury..	1
In Thailand, the number of patients who are infected with @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ has been increasing. The data show that the prevalence increased from 1.5% (n = 87) in 1994 to 9.2% (n = 190) in 2006. People between the ages of 6 and 40 years in Thailand have the highest risk of @di$ infection @/di$.	1
In a double-blind study, 20 patients with peritonsillar @di$ abscesses @/di$ were treated with 2 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days together with needle aspiration, incision and daily drainage, and 20 patients were treated with 2 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. and 0.8 g metronidazole b.i.d. for ten days together with needle aspiration, incision and daily drainage. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from pus in 20 of the patients with peritonsillar @di$ abscesses @/di$, in five of these together with indigenous oropharyngeal aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Pure anaerobic bacteria were found in nine @di$ abscesses @/di$, together with indigenous aerobic microorganisms in eight, and together with group A, C and G streptococci in five. In one patient heavily colonized with beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ and Bacteroides, group A beta-streptococci failed to be eradicated.	1
In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with 78 adults with acute watery @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and severe dehydration, 37 subjects were positive for @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$. In conjunction with rehydration therapy, 13 patients received norfloxacin, 12 received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and 12 received a placebo. Norfloxacin was superior to TMP-SMX and to the placebo in reducing stool output, duration of @di$ diarrhea @/di$, fluid requirements, and vibrio excretion.	1
In a model of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, overgrowth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis populations, which are representative of the Enterobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla respectively, are associated with high levels of expression of TLR and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, increased E. coli or E. faecalis populations are also associated with clinically active CD. In contrast, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and @gm$ Lactobacillus johnsonii @/gm$, which are representative of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes respectively, are reduced during the devolvement of @di$ colitis @/di$ and this reduction is more pronounced for @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ in colitic mice challenged with the opportunistic yeast Candida glabrata.	2
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of elderly residents in an aged care facility by Nagata et al., a reduction in the incidence of @di$ fever @/di$ and an improvement in the frequency of defecation were observed in a group (n = 36) that received fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota (at least 4 x 1010 CFUs) for 6 months compared with a placebo group (n = 36). Concomitantly, the fecal acetate concentration and the numbers of Bifidobacterium and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ were significantly higher in the Lactobacillus casei Shirota fermented milk intake group than in the placebo group.	2
In a random forest analysis, 22 variables were deemed important in predicting the @di$ PHES @/di$ (Figure 4). Of these, six variables were found to be significantly associated with @di$ PHES @/di$ by linear regression (Table 2). Two taxa were positively associated with @di$ PHES @/di$ scores, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$, both short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers. Two taxa were negatively correlated with @di$ PHES @/di$ scores:Enterobacter asburiae and B.	2
In a rat-induced @di$ allergic @/di$ asthma model using ovalbumin (OVA), Domingos-Lopes et al. demonstrated that the orally administered EPS producer @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ induced immune tolerance to the allergen OVA, specifically by downregulating the overproduction of IgE and reducing the Th2-mediated @di$ allergic @/di$ response.	2
In a recent study by Toyoshima and colleagues, @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ was found responsible for a fatal respiratory illness in a 68-year old female. Other studies have also reported on the emergence of Acinetobacter species other than A. baumannii which were often associated with bacteraemia. The detection of these organisms in water samples from HIV-infected patients in the Limpopo province indicates the possibility of involvement of these organisms in the pathogenicity of opportunistic infections among patients. In fact, @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ is known to be involved in several diseases, such as sepsis, bacteraemia, @di$ pyrexia @/di$, meningitis, post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus, rigours, pneumonia, cellulitis, rash, ophthalmia neonatum, urinary tract infection (UTI), and abscess. Further studies are needed to identify the potential of this organism as an opportunistic pathogen among HIV-infected patients in the region. Results of a study in Italy indicate that Acinetobacter spp. were responsible for several diseases in HIV-infected and AIDS patients, including sepsis, UTIs, respiratory tract diseases, and bacteraemic pneumonia. In that study, the organisms responsible included A. calcoaceticus, @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$, and other Acinetobacter spp.	1
In a study conducted in India on @di$ neonatal sepsis @/di$, S. aureus followed by Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) was the most frequently detected as the etiological agent. The authors added that S. aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis, and 57.4% of the S. aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. A similar study from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, also revealed that the single most frequent organism was S. epidermidis accounting for 36% (58/190) of all proven cases. Therefore, S. epidermidis, though it is a normal flora, under certain circumstances especially MDR strains, may cause fatal neonatal diseases. Also from Saudi Arabia, an investigation on the correlation of @di$ neonatal sepsis @/di$ and the extremely low-birth-weight, showed that E. coli (29%) was the most common causing early onset sepsis, whereas, CoNS (50%) was the most common infecting organism causing late onset sepsis. The importance of Enterococci (primarily, E. faecalis and @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$) as a leading cause of nosocomial infections in several countries is well recognized.	1
In a study from North India, the most prevalent Shigella species among hospitalized children with diarrhea between 2001 and 2004 was @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ (60%), followed by Shigella sonnei (23.8%), Shigella dysenteriae (9.8%), and Shigella boydii (5.7%). @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$, especially serotype 2a, was found to be the most common serotype among children in several other studies from the Indian subcontinent. Grossly, bloody stools, @di$ dehydration @/di$, and seizures have been associated more frequently with Shigella species when compared with other intestinal bacterial pathogens. Unlike S. dysenteriae type 1 and @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ have been less frequently reported to cause severe extraintestinal as well as intestinal manifestations (i.e. intussusception and rectal prolapse). In our case, abdominal cramp, vomiting, pallor, @di$ dehydration @/di$, and passage of bloody stool with mucus in the infant simulated the clinical picture of intussusception, mandating abdominal ultrasonography to rule it out.	1
In a study of human gut microflora, @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ was identified in a significantly greater number of samples from healthy controls than from patients with @di$ Crohn's disease @/di$. Anaerotruncus and @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ appear to play a positive role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. Lachnospiraceae species are also associated with maintenance of gut health, and members of this family may protect against colon cancer in humans by producing butyric acid. Mice administered retinoic acid (RA) orally and then subjected to partial hepatectomy had higher levels of Lachnospiraceae than mice in the control group, which were not treated with RA. In the present study, VAD reduced the abundance of Anaerotruncus and @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ in the colonic mucosa, and the abundance of Lachnospiraceae _NK4A136 _ group was also lower in the combined VAD group than in the VAN group, while VAD upregulated the abundance of Parasutterella. Previously, the Parasutterella abundance was found to be increased and the Lachnospiraceae abundance was decreased in the submucosal tissues of patients with @di$ Crohn's disease @/di$.	2
In addition to MG, MS, and @gm$ ORT @/gm$ bacteria, other respiratory viruses such as AOaV-1, ACV, and AIV subtype H9N2 were detected in the broiler flocks tested positive for studied bacterial @di$ respiratory pathogens @/di$. These viruses have been implicated by several authors as primary @di$ respiratory pathogens @/di$ in Iranian commercial poultry farms suggesting that they play a prominent role in the clinical respiratory disease (Bashashati et al.,; Haji-Abdolvahab et al.,; Molouki et al.,). Viral respiratory infections in birds cause tissue damage, accordingly facilitating the invasion of bacteria, resulting in loss of tissue function. Three possible mechanisms are considered for this tissue damage: (a) loss of cilia and ciliated cells as a result of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, (b) inhibition of mucociliary clearance due to decreased ciliary activity, and (c) bacterial adherence and colonization due to damage to the epithelium (Bakaletz,; El Ahmer et al.,; Wilson et al.,). On the contrary, a previous bacterial infection is beneficial for the pathogenesis of some viral agents such as low pathogenic AIV because it facilitates the cleavage of HA protein through protease-producing bacteria (Kishida et al.,). However, bacterial infection may suppress viral pathogenesis by the modulation of the innate immune response and preventing virus entry to the susceptible cells (Sid et al.,). Avian mycoplasmas (MG and MS) often cause subclinical upper respiratory tract infections, and respiratory clinical signs are usually prominent in concomitant infection with other @di$ respiratory pathogens @/di$ in poultry. Under field conditions, H9N2 viruses frequently coinfect other bacteria such as E. coli, MG, MS, @gm$ ORT @/gm$, Avibacterium paragallinarum, Chlamydia psittaci, and Staphylococcus aureus (Roussan et al.,; Samy & Naguib,).	1
In addition to Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Hafnia alvei, which have been isolated from the fish incriminated in @di$ scombroid poisoning @/di$, several species of the enteric bacteria capable of producing histamine have also been isolated from fish. These include Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia fonticola, Serratia liquefaciens, and Citrobacter freundii. Other than the enteric bacteria, Clostridium spp., Vibrio alginolyticus, Acinetobacter lowffi, @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas spp., and Photobacterium spp.	1
In addition to Muribaculaceae, other Bacteroidetes genera with high MDG coefficients included @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ and Parabacteroides. All of these genera are common commensals of the mammalian gut microbiome, with decreased abundances of @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ specifically linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent results have shown that Muribaculaceae is negatively correlated with inflammation in a colitis mouse model. Although this genus was often abundant in the NOD2DeltaDC groups, the species and strain differences within this and many other genera should be considered. For this reason, an NCBI BLAST search was conducted to further classify important OTUs at either the species or strain level. OTU147 was aligned with Parabacteroides goldsteinii, which has been shown to reduce @di$ obesity @/di$ in mice fed a high-fat diet. Additionally, OTU063 aligned to Culturomica sp., a newly isolated bacterium from the human gut, and is phylogenetically close to @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ (OTU063 was classified based on our alignment).	2
In addition to a reduction in autochthonous bacteria, increased amounts of potential pathogens, including @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$, Corynebacterium, Cardiobacterium, Kingella, Streptococcus and Rothia, were observed in ASD patients. These pathogens are quite different from @di$ intestinal bacterial pathogens @/di$, such as Clostridium, Sutterella, and Desulfovibrio, which were not detected in the present study. In the genus @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$, for example, all seven members were more abundant in salivary samples from ASD patients, with OTU159, OTU189 and OTU361 significantly discriminative. They were also positively correlated to ABC scores (Fig. 5a), indicating an association with ASD symptom severity. Their nearest neighbor, @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$, a Gram-negative and facultative anaerobic bacteria, is not only prevalent in oral diseases, but also considered a potential pathogen causing diseases in remote target organs and systems, e.g. bacteremia and infectious endocarditis. These evidences indicate that @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ and its metabolites could gain access to the bloodstream and trigger disease outbreaks. @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ was also reported to bypass the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enter the cerebrospinal fluid, and cause meningitis. Thus, we hypothesized that @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ and its metabolites in the oral cavity might enter the blood circulation and even cross the BBB to affect brain development in ASD children.	1
In addition to its apparent ability to infect the bladder and kidneys, @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ has also been described in @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$. One study reported thirty cases of bacteremia caused by @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ among obstetric patients over a 4-year period and suggests that bacteremia caused by this organism may be significantly underreported. Although cases of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ bacteremia are enriched in the gynecologic setting, occurring after birth or following procedures such as endometrial ablation or vaginal myomectomy, @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ @di$ bloodstream infection @/di$ is not limited to women. Indeed, the evidence suggests that female to male transmission of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ can occur during sexual encounters and that regular condom use reduces the likelihood that @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ can be isolated from male urine. In one example of @di$ bloodstream infection @/di$ in a male, a previously healthy individual with flank pain was found to have urolithiasis (kidney stones) with fever, elevated peripheral neutrophils, and elevated creatinine (indicating damage to the kidneys). Blood cultures revealed the man had urosepsis caused by a coccobacilli that produced pinpoint grey colonies on chocolate agar. In this case the hospital microbiology lab was not equipped to identify the organism. Instead, a national microbiology laboratory performed an extensive workup, identifying the organism as @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$. Another example involved an uncircumcised man with a previous history of diabetes mellitus and an ongoing sexual partner with recurrent BV. The man was shown to have bloodstream @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, infective endocarditis, along with apparent septic emboli on one kidney and in the brain. In this case, routine culture of the urine was also unable to identify @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ as the culprit.	1
In addition to the commonly used Amsel criteria and Nugent score, five highly sensitive and specific multiplex PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women (@di$ BD @/di$ Max  Vaginal Panel, Hologic Aptima  BV, LabCorp NuSwab  VG, Quest Diagnostics  SureSwab  Bacterial Vaginosis, and Medical Diagnostics Laboratory (MDL) OneSwab ). These assays include various combinations of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp.	2
In addition to the role of @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$, our serum chemistry and clinical chemistry-based RF models were highly sensitive in accurately classifying strictures. Decreased total protein levels are often observed with GI disease and may indicate poor digestion/absorption. The importance of amylase and lipase in our stricture model is supported by clinical findings of cholecystitis and secondary pancreatitis. Secondary pancreatitis, attributed to extension from duodenal ulcers, was observed in 15 of 17 cases scored. In the CBC-based model, HCT, HGB, RBC, RDW, and MCH relate to red blood cell function and suggested @di$ anemia @/di$. @di$ Anemia @/di$, a common finding in marmosets with strictures and IBD, is also a risk factor for NEC in humans. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of strictures showed enrichment of lipid metabolism and intestinal absorption genes, which may reflect enterocyte damage and is consistent with lipidomic alterations induced by @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ alpha-toxin, a phospholipase C. Increased expression of FABP1 and FABP2 was observed. These genes encode for liver and intestinal fatty-acid binding proteins (LFABP and IFABP), respectively, and are often used as biomarkers of GI diseases, including NEC. To our knowledge, correlations of gut FABP2 levels with serum IFABP levels have not been described, but we hypothesize that increased expression might be a compensatory mechanism triggered by enteritis. While increased inflammatory responses were not observed due to the lack of healthy control tissue, based on the @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ infection, development of enteritis, @di$ anemia @/di$ and strictures and deregulation of lipid metabolism, we believe marmosets could be developed as a model to investigate the mechanisms of bacterially-driven CNE/NEC.	1
In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$ and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. @di$ fragilis @/di$ while was not against F. varium. Against @gm$ P. prevotii @/gm$ bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar.	2
In addition, @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ may be a rare cause of pyogenic arthritis in patients who are immunocompromised or who have a history of close animal contact. In order to prevent the impaired mobility of the joint due to subsequent MO, physicians should be vigilant when treating pyogenic arthritis in immunocompromised patients who present with severe @di$ joint pain @/di$.	1
In addition, acetate can significantly regulate the levels of DNA methylation at the host miR-378a promoter, which also contribute to the improvement of obesity and @di$ glucose intolerance @/di$. It has been reported that @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ could utilize polysaccharides with its glycoside hydrolase, and further produced acetate to affect host health.	2
In addition, antibiotic selection has varied widely in documented cases of NJSA due to @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ with agents including chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, meropenem, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tobramycin prescribed, both individually and in combination, after synovial fluid culture speciation. Metronidazole is currently the most commonly used antibiotic in this setting. Metronidazole demonstrates excellent in vitro activity against @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ and has been shown to penetrate well into synovial fluid, thus making it an extremely viable option for treatment. In addition, metronidazole resistance is rare, with >99% of gram-negative anaerobes demonstrating susceptibility to this agent. This demonstrates superiority to alternatives with @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$ showing 10-42%, 1-22%, and 0-5% resistance to clindamycin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively. Metronidazole is generally well-tolerated, with common adverse effects including @di$ nausea @/di$, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.	0
In addition, several pathogenic or opportunistic pathogen bacteria including @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginasa, Delftia tsuruhatensis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Escherichia coli were present in most of the collected colostrum samples. Genus @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$, Acinetobacter, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas were also detected in healthy colostrum samples in the study of Lima et al.. Pathogenic bacteria in colostrum or regular milk are considered to be detrimental to newborns. However, recent studies have proven that animals exposed to a certain amount of pathogen have stronger resistance to subsequent @di$ infection @/di$.	1
In addition, the bacterial abundance of 4 genera including Fibrobacter and @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ were decreased, and Selenomonas were increased only in the pigs from the E. faecalis group compared with the basal diet group on d 28. A decrease in Fibrobacter genus was consistent with the decrease in Fibrobacteres phyla in E. faecalis group on d 28 of feeding. Some species of @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ may cause diarrhea, and Selenomonas was related to obesity. The decrease of @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ and the increase of Selenomonas may cause the decreased incidence of diarrhea and the increased body @di$ weight gain @/di$ in the E.	2
In addition, this ancient specimen allowed DNA detection of oral pathogens that likely caused localized @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (Rascovan et al., 2016). In 2018, a new metagenomic approach called MEGAN alignment tool (MALT) successfully analyzed data of DNA from ancient pulp and confirmed the presence of @gm$ Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C @/gm$, this pathogen was proposed as the causative agent of the epidemic at Teposcolula Yucundaa-Mexico during the 1545-1550 period (Vagene et al., 2018).	1
In addition, we also observed that a subset of these taxa that were enriched in multiple diseases were also associated with @di$ frailty @/di$ in the ELDERMET cohort. In this current analysis, we, therefore, checked for either enrichment or depletion of each of these multiple-disease-associated taxa in each of the six LbTypes. We found that subjects harboring the L. gasseri-fermentum-salivarius Lactobacillotype were enriched for several taxa including C. citroniae, C. symbiosum, C. bolteae, C. asparagiforme, C. symbiosum, Clostridiales bacterium 1_47FAA, that were not only enriched in multiple diseases but also associated with increased @di$ frailty @/di$ in the elderly individuals (Figure 4(b)).  In contrast, this LbType was negatively associated with multiple health-associated taxa including C. catus, E. rectale, @gm$ B. crossotus @/gm$, D.	2
In another Chinese @di$ obesity @/di$ cohort, Liu et al. also explored gut microbiome alterations among @di$ obese @/di$ subjects and after LSG. In their study, @di$ obese @/di$ parameters mainly included BMI, waist, WHR and whole body fat, while visceral fat was not measured. They found that @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ and C. comes were positively correlated with @di$ obesity @/di$, which was consistent with our findings. B. thetaiotaomicron, a healthy marker species which was negatively related to @di$ obese @/di$ parameters in their study, was also increased after LSG in our study. However, we found that @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$ and B. thetaiotaomicron were not correlated with VFA. Consistent with their findings, we also found that the capacity of L-glutamate and L-glutamine biosynthesis was highly enriched in the @di$ obese @/di$ microbiome.	1
In both the root end and periapical samples, Fusobacterium nucleatum (71.6%), Dialister pneumosintes (58.3%) and @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ (48.3%) were the most prevalent species. Dialister pneumosintes showed statistically significant values in the root end, and F. nucleatum was also significant in the apical periodontitis samples. A statistically significant association between @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ and Porphyromonas gingivalis in the root ends was observed. Bacterial associations from 2 to 7 species were observed in most samples. Extra-radicular and/or intra-radicular @di$ infections @/di$ were present in all teeth with failed endodontic treatment, and showed polymicrobial @di$ infection @/di$ in most cases, with a predominance of F. nucleatum, D. pneumosintes and @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$.	1
In both treated and untreated HIV, @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ non-pneumophila infections commonly manifest as fever, cough, @di$ dyspnea @/di$, diarrhea, pleuritic chest pain, and effusion, with documented instances of pulmonary cavities, nodules, and lung abscesses.	1
In brief, a total of 72 patients were grouped into mild (stage 1 and 2, n = 26), moderate (stage 3, n = 26) and advanced (stage 4 and 5, n = 20) CKD and compared to 20 healthy controls for their blood serum and fecal sample targeted analysis of serum bile acids, SCFAs, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and @di$ uremic toxins @/di$ (pCS and IS). The authors identified that when progressing from early to advanced stages, Prevotella sp. 885, Weissella confuse, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, and Bacteroides eggerthii levels were significantly reduced, while Alloscardovia omnicolens, Merdibacter massiliensis, and Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum levels were elevated significantly.	0
In cIAIs, the infections spread beyond the local site, with a resulting @di$ peritonitis @/di$ (or abscess). @di$ Peritonitis @/di$ is further categorized as primary (no loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal [GI] tract), secondary (loss of GI tract integrity, usually by perforation or from infected viscera such as the appendix), and tertiary (recurrent infection following a primary or secondary @di$ peritonitis @/di$). In addition, secondary cIAIs are usually polymicrobial, with a potential mixture of Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There may be so many different or varied types of bacteria present, including some potentially antimicrobial-resistant strains that all may not be able to be isolated and identified. The most commonly isolated nonanaerobes are the Gram-negative Enterobacter species, E. coli, @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram-positive Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species.	1
In comparison with other strain backgrounds, the @di$ CEN.PK @/di$ lineage may have at least one specific advantage for enabling anaerobic growth on d-xylose. Using a different S. cerevisiae genetic background, Sato et al. evolved a @gm$ Clostridium phytofermentans @/gm$ xylA-expressing strain for anaerobic xylose fermentation and analysed causal mutations (Sato et al.).	0
In conclusion, flagella and flagellin from @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ (ST1 and ST4), C. malonaticus, C. muytjensii, C. turicensis, and C. dublinensis elicit a strong @di$ inflammatory @/di$ response in human macrophages, including the production of neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 and TNF-alpha.	1
In conclusion, our findings suggest that an increase in MCV is associated with body weight gain and improvement of subclinical IDA after @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ eradication in elderly patients with chronic gastritis. The tendency for subclinical IDA to improve after @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ eradication did not correlate with the presence of GHP. In addition, even with the 2 years period of the study, no significant changes were seen in the various nutritional factors, indicating that the better digestion, absorption, after the eradication therapy. For the future perspective, as the development of an aging society may be upcoming event in the near future, @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ eradication therapy may be a useful approach for preventing weight loss and @di$ frailty @/di$ in elderly individuals to keep their quality of life and health.	2
In conclusion, the decreased abundance of several primary degraders and the accompanying difference in metabolic activity, namely the starch degrader, @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ and butyrate, might be a potential mechanistic explanation for the association between early life nutrition and the gut microbiome in the development of @di$ AD @/di$.	1
In conclusion, we found that early in treatment of @di$ CF @/di$ PEx, Pseudomonas RA, but not anaerobic genera RA was associated with lower FEV1 and higher levels of inflammation. Furthermore, low microbial diversity was associated with higher RA of Pseudomonas, lower lung function and increased inflammation. With treatment, changes in RA of specific bacterial genera were markedly variable, in contrast to Pseudomonas which decreased. The changes in RA of anaerobic genera, with the exception of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, were not associated with change in FEV1. Given that @di$ CF @/di$ PEx treatment results in variable changes of anaerobic genera suggests the need for larger studies particularly in patients without traditional @di$ CF @/di$ pathogens.	0
In conclusion, we identified the specific bacterial species related to inflammatory markers in @di$ obese @/di$ patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the severity of @di$ obesity @/di$ and presence of two bacterial species (@gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and P.	1
In conclusion, we identified the specific bacterial species related to inflammatory markers in @di$ obese @/di$ patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the severity of @di$ obesity @/di$ and presence of two bacterial species (B. caccae and @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$) may be predictive markers for responders to synbiotic supplementation.	1
In concordance with the above findings, the daily administration of 0.32% EGCG to male HFD-fed C57BL/6N mice for eight weeks increased the abundance of the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria and the genera @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ and Akkermansia but decreased the abundance of phyla Deferribacteres, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, as well as an unclassified genus of Desulfovibrionaceae, compared to the untreated HFD group. The EGCG treatment inhibited BW @di$ gain @/di$, hepatic lesions size, and TG content in the liver of HFD-induced obese mice.	2
In contrast to our findings, in a scenario of DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ E. coli was antagonized by B. thetaiotaomicron and another species of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ (@gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$).	2
In contrast, 8 Proteobacteria, 3 Firmicutes, and 2 Bacteroidetes bacteria were associated with functional biomarkers of @di$ UMI @/di$. The top five bacterial species that contained the highest numbers of functions associated with biomarkers of @di$ UMI @/di$ were the opportunistic and potential opportunistic species Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Raoultella ornithinolytica (Fig. 4B). All of the identified aerobactin biosynthesis KOGs belonged to E. coli and E. cloacae. It is noteworthy that we identified bacterial species, including Escherichia coli, E. cloacae, B. thetaiotaomicron, and others, that are linked to functional biomarkers of both RMI and @di$ UMI @/di$.	1
In contrast, F.prausnitzii and @gm$ B.crossotus @/gm$ were two MHO-depleted species from our results. F.prausnitzii has been identified as a butyrate-producing bacterium, and it might function in the prevention and therapy of obesity-associated disease due to its production of anti-inflammatory metabolites. @gm$ B.crossotus @/gm$ has been reported to have decreased abundance in metabolic disorders, and high levels of @gm$ B.crossotus @/gm$ might protect against @di$ weight gain @/di$. In other words, both F.prausnitzii and @gm$ B.crossotus @/gm$ are protective species against obesity.	2
In contrast, amicoumacin A showed highly potent activity (inhibition zone >2 cm in diameter after overnight incubation) against all MSSA and MRSA strains tested including hospital-@di$ acquired MRSA @/di$ (HA-MRSA), community-@di$ acquired MRSA @/di$ (CA-MRSA), and Mu50, a HA-MRSA/VISA strain. In addition, @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$ and Streptococcus pyogenes are sensitive to amicoumacin A at a level similar to S.	1
In contrast, species Ruminococcus lactaris which was enriched in OPTIMED subgroup with no or mild SE both at M0 and M7d samples, has been enriched in healthy individuals compared to T2D patients or @di$ obese @/di$ subjects in various populations, as well as negatively associated with statin use. Within the healthy cohort (subgroup with no or mild SE) both before and after metformin use was characterized by an increased abundance of @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$, a succinate-consumer and substantial producer of short-chain fatty acids acetate and propionate.	2
In contrast, the 10 most abundant bacterial species within the modern @di$ calculus @/di$ samples were Propionibacterium acidifaciens (13.33%), Parascardovia denticolens (10.25%), Scardovia inopinata (8.57%), Lautropia mirabilis (3.66%), Actinomyces sp. oral taxon 414 (3.32%), Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum (3.06%), @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ (2.98%), Neisseria elongata (2.94%), Olsenella sp.	0
In contrast, the microbiome of INF-CVID patients showed a preponderance of several microbes associated with anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ effects, including Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Dorea longicatena, and Blautia faecie. Additionally, we identified in the gut microbiome of INF-CVID patients an enrichment of microbes that are associated with healthy metabolism, including @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, Coprococcus catus, and Roseburia hominis.	2
In contrast, the subgingival plaque was made up primarily of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$, and Prevotella intermedia which are known to be @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$.	1
In fact, patients with phenylketonuria, an @di$ inborn metabolic error @/di$, have been reported to have lower Odoribacter and @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$ abundance and interestingly, a study addressed by Moseley revealed that almost 26% of phenylketonuria patients had blood lipid profile alteration.	1
In fact, ureolytic activity has a key role in the pathogenesis of bacteria such as @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Ureoplasma urealyticum, and Yersinia enterocolitica, and such activity has been reported in diseases such as urolithiasis, pyelonephritis, ammonia encephalopathy, HE, hepatic coma, and @di$ gastroduodenal infections @/di$.	1
In general, the @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ infection model in zebrafish is well established. As @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ is a common pathogen of zebrafish, it can be considered a more natural model for studying host-@gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ interaction, than is, for example the M. tuberculosis mouse model. The histopathology of mycobacterial lesions in zebrafish has been shown to be more similar to human @di$ TB @/di$ than is the histopathology in the mouse model (reviewed in). The genetic similarities between @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ and M. tuberculosis are well documented, including the currently known genes involved in virulence and in dormancy (Dos-regulon). Thus, it is likely that the characterization of phenomena involved in latent infections and dormancy in a @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ infection, is useful for understanding human @di$ latent TB @/di$.	1
In general, the virulence of Shigella is in the order, S.dysenteriae > @gm$ S.flexneri @/gm$ > S.sonnei. The lack of ShET1 and Pic, and SepA in Ss046 may collectively make S.sonnei lesser virulent than @gm$ S.flexneri @/gm$, as these are probably the major determinants involved in the diarrhoeal phase of the @di$ infection @/di$.	1
In hepatobiliary cancers, a higher abundance of @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium-GAM147 was found in patients with longer progression-free survival (PFS), while a higher abundance of Veillonellaceae was found in patients with shorter PFS and overall survival (OS). The gut microbiome is associated with the clinical response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with hepatobiliary cancers. In metastatic @di$ melanoma @/di$, Faecalibacterium enrichment is associated with a good clinical response to ipilimumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-4).	0
In humans, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ causes symptoms such as severe diarrhoea and abdominal cramping. During @di$ infection @/di$, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ trigger a range of immune responses and studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in regulating immune responses in several ways. The mechanisms known so far range from regulation of inflammation-dependent genes to control of apoptosis of infected host cells. Understanding miRNA function can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of microorganisms. Here, the role of miR-125a-5p in infections with bacterial pathogens is of particular interest. In Mycobacterium avium infections, miR-125a-5p was overexpressed in human macrophages as part of the innate immune response to the bacterial infection. On the other hand, upregulated miR-125a in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections was associated with enhanced bacterial survival in human and murine macrophages. Furthermore, H. pylori infections in humans were accompanied by decreased miR-125a-5p expression and downregulation of miR-125a in mesenteric lymph nodes of piglets after Salmonella Typhimurium infection was identified, triggering diverse immune responses. Finally, @di$ C. jejuni infections @/di$ in mice have been recently found to be associated with reduced miR-125a-5p and enhanced miR-613-3p expression in the colon. Interestingly, all studies that have focussed on infections with intestinal pathogens revealed decreased expression of miR-125a-5p. In the present study, we focused on the interaction of miRNA-125a-5p with putative targets conserved in human and mice to emphasise its relevance in @di$ C. jejuni infections @/di$. In silico analysis determined two overlapping targets of both dysregulated miRNAs involved in mucin-type O-glycosylation being conserved in human and mice, St3gal1 and B4galt1. Here, miR-125a-5p was selected because of its known involvement in several bacterial infections, including @di$ C. jejuni infections @/di$.	1
In humans, although extra-intestinal diseases of @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ are rare, it has been associated with secondary infections in immunocompromised states, including malignancy, blood disorders and hepatobiliary disease. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ may often be missed in stool samples due to its small colony size and relatively low prevalence in gastrointestinal samples. The lack of a routine assay for @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ in cases of gastroenteritis means that this bacterium is identified only occasionally. Xia et al reported a case of @di$ meningoencephalitis @/di$ caused by @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ with a fatal outcome in a Chinese neonate.	1
In humans, an intra-duodenal microbiome transfer from lean healthy donors to individuals with @di$ impaired insulin sensitivity @/di$ improves insulin sensitivity in the recipients (Vrieze et al.,). Interestingly, transferring the fecal microbiome from obese or lean discordant human twin pairs to mice resulted in impaired glucose metabolism in the mouse if the transfer came from an obese twin (Ridaura et al.,). In mice, antiobiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves peripheral insulin sensitivity caused by a WD (Suarez-Zamorano et al.,). The effect of gut microbiota on peripheral insulin sensitivity begins at the level of the intestinal mucosa, as WD-induced @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ is prevented by blocking live intestinal bacteria from translocating into the blood and tissues where they generate an inflammatory response (Amar et al.,). Bacterial translocation preceded WD-induced @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, and required functioning Nod1 and CD14 receptors, which bind to gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the translocation of bacteria and the @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ were preventable when animals were treated with the probiotic @gm$ Bifidobacterium Animalis @/gm$, which specifically prevents translocation of Enterobacteriaceae (Amar et al.,).	2
In humans, brucellosis can cause a severe febrile disease with various clinical complications ranging from mild to severe symptoms including undulant @di$ fever @/di$, joint pain arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis. Brucella is a genus of Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria that belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria. Currently, the genus consists of 10 species that are classified based on their host preferences. Although several Brucella species are potentially zoonotic agents, Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis), Brucella abortus (B. abortus), and @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ (@gm$ B. suis @/gm$) are considered the most pathogenic Brucella species that have a serious impact on public health and the livestock industry.	1
In its previous nomenclature as Bacteroides ureolyticus it was known to cause soft tissue infections and @di$ urethritis @/di$ and it has only recently been implicated as a cause of diarrhoea. Its significant association with UC in our study suggests that these patients may be susceptible to colonisation with @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ and perhaps this is genus-specific rather than to any particular @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species. This is supported by the increased number of mixed @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ (with relatively rare members of the @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ genus, including C. showae, C. curvus and C. gracilis) in adults with ulcerative colitis as opposed to controls. This finding is similar to those in paediatric Crohn's disease reported by Man et al. The increased diversity of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species in UC may reflect a specific defect in the immunological handling of this genus in the intestinal mucosa of UC. The additional finding of mixed Helicobacteraceae and @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species in UC suggest that this defect may extend to the entire phylum of Proteobacteria.	1
In light of the therapeutic effect of isoflavones and their derivatives in menopausal disorders and estrogenic-related @di$ osteoporosis @/di$, Kawada et al. proceeded to evaluate the enzymatic parameters of daidzein reductase, which is intervenient in the conversion of daidzein in the human intestine. According to their results related to enantioselectivity, a highly purified form of the enzyme from @gm$ Eggerthella sp. YY7918 @/gm$ was able to synthesise (R)-dihydrodaidzein (Figure 26), disclosing a methodology to obtain enantiomeric pure forms of (R)-dihydroisoflavones.	2
In mice, lung exposure to @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$ induced less toll-like receptor(TLR)2-dependent inflammation than the pathogen Haemophilus influenzae. Similarly, another Prevotella species induced TLR2 signaling but fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than a cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen in human CF bronchial epithelial cells. In the context of CF, both positive and negative roles have been attributed to anaerobic bacteria including @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$, though Prevotella abundance correlates with milder CF in some cases. Prevotella species are not universally beneficial or benign members of the airway microbiome. Unlike @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$, Prevotella intermedia is frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses, expresses virulence factors including a type 6 secretion system (T6SS), and enhances susceptibility to S. pneumoniae by upregulating a critical host adherence receptor. @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$ has been identified in polymicrobial lung abscesses, though it is unclear which species drive abscess formation, and causes increased tissue damage in the context of bleomycin-induced @di$ pulmonary fibrosis @/di$ in mice.	1
In murine models the presence of certain bacteria, including Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ has been associated with colitis. Bacteria such as Citrobacter rodentium, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium avium, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are commonly used in animal models to trigger colitis-like conditions. In particular, the C. rodentium infection is used as a model for several important human @di$ intestinal disorders @/di$, including CD, UC, and colon tumorigenesis.	1
In nature, most biofilms comprise multiple species, and @di$ dental caries @/di$ arise from a polymicrobial infection process that is largely attributable to the formation of dental biofilms. S. mutans is considered to be one of the most important odontopathogens involved in the initiation and maturation of dental biofilms. @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ is also known to be one of the most abundant species in dental biofilms, and it is connected to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, which are beneficial for biofilm accumulation and maturation.	1
In order of frequency, the pathogens were @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ (from aquariums), M. chelonae (from iatrogenic lesions) and M. avium-intracellulare (in immunodepression). M. fortuitum, M. ulcerans, M. flavescens, M. haemophilum and M. kansasii were rare. The formation of epithelial giant-cell @di$ granulomas @/di$ was observed in patients without any other pathology.	1
In order to identify the bacterial taxa differently abundant in the presence of sialidase activity, the 44 samples with molecular-@di$ BV @/di$ (CST IV) were tested using LEfSe. The relative abundances of 80 bacterial taxa that were the most representative population-wide (>0.05%) were used at this analysis. The list of all bacterial taxa and their respective overall abundances is provided in  Supplementary Table 2 .  Figure 1  depicts the result of LEfSe showing a total of 24 enriched taxa in the presence of sialidase activity, of which 7 (29%) belong to Prevotella genera. Other well-acknowledged @di$ BV @/di$-associated bacteria taxa were also enriched in sialidase-positive samples, such as Leptotrichia amnionii, Megasphaera sp., Mobiluncus curtisii, and @gm$ BVAB3 @/gm$ (the novel @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$).	1
In other studies, high butyrate and propionate excretion was observed in @di$ obese @/di$ mice (Turnbaugh et al., 2006), corroborating the idea that a reduction in butyrate and propionate may provide some positive metabolic effects to the host. Additionally, the negative correlations between the abundance of P. goldsteinii and @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ and isobutyrate concentration suggest that a high isobutyrate level may be unfavorable to possibly harmful bacteria (Wang et al., 2018), thus decreasing their abundance.	0
In our cohort, the B-cell-attracting chemokine CXCL13 in CSF could not significantly distinguish different viral pathogen-related diseases, such as TBE, @di$ VZV-infections @/di$, or HSV-1 (meningo-) encephalitis from each other, or multiple sclerosis, limbic encephalitis, paraneoplastic syndrome, neuroinfectious diseases of unknown pathogens, or bacterial meningitis. Thus, as described earlier, CXCL13 appears to be the intrinsic response to specific lipoprotein surface structures, such as OspA and Pam3C in the spirochete species Borrelia burgdorferi and @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$, in contrast to lipopolysaccharides of pneumococci.	0
In our study, @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ spp. isolates were detected in 46 faecal samples and ticks (6.5%), and the highest prevalence was detected among duck (93%) and wild boar samples (29%) that respectively were 28% and 41% regarding the 46 positive samples. A great variability of @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species was observed, being P. putida and P. aeruginosa the most predominant ones. P. aeruginosa was detected among sheep and wild boar samples. This species is one of the most relevant opportunistic human pathogens, although other species such as P. putida, P. fluorescens, P. mendocina, @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ or P. monteilii, have also caused human @di$ clinical infections @/di$.	1
In our study, Akkermansia transplantation was performed to confirm whether Akkermansia was able to ameliorate @di$ vascular calcification @/di$. Interestingly, Akkermansia supplementation was suggested to relieve @di$ vascular calcification @/di$. Analysis of gut microbiota diversity showed that orally delivered Akkermansia changed the composition and structure of the microbiota. Akkermansia is a bacterium that degrades mucins, producing acetate, propionate and small nitrogen-containing molecules. Non-mucin-degrading bacteria utilise carbon and nitrogen sources provided by Akkermansia, promoting their own growth and colonisation. It has been reported that cocultured Akkermansia and non-mucin-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$, Roseburia and Eubacterium hallii, can mutually promote growth and butyrate production.	2
In our study, probiotic @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ CP-9 in combination with phototherapy significantly decreased the serum bilirubin decline rate and phototherapy duration in the experimental group compared with the control group. Additionally, the probiotic strain effectively benefited the serum bilirubin decline rate in combination with phototherapy in the first 24 h. E. coli has been reported to facilitate the production of urobilin in vitro and beta-glucuronidase. Thus, we screened probiotic candidates for @di$ NJ @/di$ treatment based on their anti-E. coli activity. Section 1 of our study (in vitro screening part; Fig. 2) reveals that the probiotic @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ CP-9 efficiently inhibited the growth of E. coli. A semiquantitative miniaturized system, API ZYM strip, was used to determine 19 enzymatic activities. The API ZYM test revealed that @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ CP-9 secretes minimal amounts of beta-glucuronidase (Fig. S2). Therefore, probiotic @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ CP-9 was used to study the clinical benefit of probiotics in @di$ NJ @/di$. Besides, the safety used of the probiotic @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ CP-9 has been reported in previous study.	2
In our study, we found that @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ belonged to Firmicutes was the common microbial characteristics of diabetes, and contributed a lot to distinguish individuals with diabetes from controls, which is consistent with previous studies that phyla Firmicutes (eg.@gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$) were more abundant in obese people those had worse glucose level. Ruminococcus flora help gut epithelial cells to absorb sugars, which might contribute to weight gain in the host. Results from diabetic rats model demonstrated that blood glucose was positively correlated with Ruminococcus . In previous animal studies, two Parabacteroides species, including Parabacteroides distasonis and Parabacteroides goldsteinii, played roles in anti-obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistant. Parabacteroides merdae, which is opportunistic pathogenic taxa, was reported frequently distributed in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ gut microbiome, further investigations whether Parabacteroides merdae play preventive role in the progression of diabetes need be conducted.	1
In parallel, independent studies exploring @di$ LBP @/di$ suggested that @gm$ CA @/gm$ was a contaminant rather than a real infectious agent.	0
In particular, the presence in the ileum of the clostridial species @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$ was related with protection against @di$ food allergy @/di$.	2
In patients with Parkinson's diseases, changes in the content of 9 genera and 15 species of microorganisms were revealed: reduced content of Dorea, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides massiliensis, Stoquefichus massiliensis, Bacteroides coprocola, Blautia glucerasea, Dorea longicatena, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides plebeus, Prevotella copri, Coprococcus eutactus, and @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$, and increased content of Christensenella, Catabacter, Lactobacillus, Oscillospira, Bifidobacterium, Christensenella minuta, Catabacter hongkongensis, Lactobacillus mucosae, Ruminococcus bromii, and Papillibacter cinnamivorans. This microbiological pattern of gut microflora can trigger local inflammation followed by aggregation of alpha-synuclein and generation of @di$ Lewy bodies @/di$.	1
In pigs, enterococci can cause serious infections, including sepsis preceded by high fever, @di$ rash @/di$ and muscle flaccidity. In addition to E. faecium and E. faecalis, other species have been isolated from farm animals, including @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$, E.	1
In previous studies enrichment of Escherichia-Shigella (Proteobacteria), Veillonella (Firmicutes), Faecalibacterium (Firmicutes), Eubacterium rectale group (Firmicutes), Streptococcus (Firmicutes), Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (Firmicutes), and reduced Prevotella strain 9 (Bacteroidetes), Megamonas (Firmicutes), and Fusobacterium (Fusobacteria) were detected in @di$ AS @/di$ patients. @di$ AS @/di$-enriched species including Bacteroides coprophilus, Parabacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium siraeum, @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ and Prevotella copri were identified in @di$ AS @/di$ patients via metagenomic analyses.	1
In previous studies, all patients with abscesses caused by @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ infections were local, but multiple skin abscesses associated with bacteremia caused by @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ were reported for the first time. Basic information of published cases and this case is shown in Table 2. @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ is easily neutralized by human serum or complement factors; thus, healthy people are rarely infected with this bacterium. This patient had a history of pneumonia, which provided the same pathological background as in the reported cases of @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ infections, most of which were patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic granuloma diseases, suggesting that people with underlying diseases are more susceptible to @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$. In addition, @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ can also easily infect newborns with low immune functions. Consistent with some reports, @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ was obtained from the blood and abscess secretions of the patients. It has also been reported that @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ was detected in lymph nodes, cornea, and sputum; therefore, it is possible to improve the detection rates of the bacterium by simultaneously examining the blood, sputum, as well as various other secretions in patients. The patient in this report had no other clinical manifestations except for skin abscesses during hospitalization, which was different from previous cases who had a fever, @di$ cough @/di$, and other symptoms. Previous studies showed that commercial tests such as the API or VITEK bacterial identification system could mistakenly identify @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ as B. cepacia. Other studies used cell fatty acid analysis or partial gene sequencing of 16S-23S rRNA to identify @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$, but the risks of misidentification always exist.	1
In previous studies, independent risk factors for the acquisition of bacteremia due to enterococci with @di$ HLGR @/di$ were intensive care unit stay, previous use of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum cephalosporin, chronic renal failure and @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ species. The results of our study are consistent with these findings; however, @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ species was not a risk factor in our study. Two kinds of patients were at especially high risk of acquiring infections with HLGR enterococci in our study: patients with neutropenia and patients with intensive care unit stay. Our data suggest that the judicious use of 3rd generation cephalosporin is important to reduce infections caused by enterococci with @di$ HLGR @/di$, especially in patients belonging to these two groups.	1
In recent years, the gut microbiota of patients with AIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis primary Sjogren's syndrome and @di$ Behcet's disease @/di$, was found to be significantly different from that of healthy people. Species that colonize the human gut, such as @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$, Ruminococcus gnavus and Lactobacillus salivarius, are implicated in the pathogenesis of AIDs.	1
In summary, @gm$ P. fulva @/gm$ is a very rare @di$ infection @/di$ in humans and only three cases have been described until now. Although this bacterium is usually an environmental microorganism, physicians and microbiologists should be aware of this @di$ infection @/di$ above all in patients with @di$ posttraumatic infections @/di$.	1
In support of this notion, a microbiota-dependent activation signal in the gut was shown to activate retina-specific T cells and intraocular inflammation in a mouse model of spontaneous @di$ uveitis @/di$. Additionally, metabolites from the abnormal gut microbiota may dysregulate host energy metabolism and induce chronic, low-grade inflammation that increases disease susceptibility. As for protective role of gut commensals in AMD, it has been reported that gut abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ was negatively correlated with complement factor H. Thus, it is worth pursuing whether @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species have a protective effect on the development of AMD via suppressing the complement system.	2
In terms of isoflavones, there is evidence in animal models that genistein has neuroprotective properties for ALS, as it eliminates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and improves @di$ gliosis @/di$ in the spinal cord. Additionally, it improves the viability of motor neurons in animal models, therefore, the effects are expected to be equally beneficial in human ALS models. Regarding its role in gut microbiota, this seems beneficial. It has been observed how an increase in several bacterial strains of Lactobacillus spp. is achieved, which are also associated with a 30% rise in SCFA. In addition, the production of microorganisms of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus group, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus was stimulated in postmenopausal women.	2
In that sense, in 2011, a hybrid EAEC-@gm$ STEC O104:H4 @/gm$ caused an important outbreak in Europe. Between 1992 and 2012, four EAEC-STEC hybrid strains were associated with small outbreak and sporadic cases of @di$ HUS @/di$.	1
In the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), Campylobacter species had the 5th greatest attributable fraction of moderate-to-severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in children under 5, with an attributable fraction as high as 16.4% in some areas. The Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) is a birth cohort study conducted in eight different countries. Analyses from MAL-ED have also identified a significant burden of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ associated with Campylobacter using both enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection. An analysis of a subset of Campylobacter-positive samples showed that roughly 30% of detections by EIA were due to other Campylobacter species, including C. hyointestinalis, C. troglodytis, and C. upsaliensis, which made up an important fraction of the disease burden. This finding is important because other diagnostic tests, both culture and FDA-approved nucleic acid based including tests such as BD Max Enteric Bacterial Panel, BD Diagnostics (Hunt Valley, MD), and BioFire Film Array Gastrointestinal Panel (Salt Lake City, UT), often target C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ but do not reliably detect other Campylobacter species.	1
In the HPV-clearance women, multivariate logistic analysis and LEfSe analysis confirmed the significant enrichment of species @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$, E. eligens and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The clearance effect might be due to the innate immune response (Toll-like receoptors-TLR) that is involved in a cascade of events promoting HPV clearance. TLR 3 and TLR9 play a role in regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokine and anti-viral environments of the lower female genital tract during viral and @di$ bacterial infection @/di$; intense inflammatory response induced by @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ in viral clearance, as well as viral proteins and other intrinsic host factors (such as sexual behaviors) responsible for HPV clearance.	1
In the TDA co-enrichment analysis, however, this species was associated with the probiotic species associated with the low severity group - @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ - and Eubacterium hallii, Ruminoccus obeum, and Dorea formicigenerans. This could suggest an indirect mechanism of action on COVID-19 severity by reducing the abundance of those probiotic species that future studies should explore further. In line with the TDA finding and the Zuo et al. study, but not the PERMANOVA finding, the literature suggests a more pro-inflammatory profile of Collinsella aerofacis, as it seems to play a role in regulating immunity: it is associated with immunotoxicity in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in cancer, with type 2 diabetes, and with rheumatoid arthritis, although other studies report the opposite. In overweight and @di$ obese @/di$ pregnant women, a study found a positive association of the genus Collinsella with circulating insulin and a negative association with dietary fibre intake.	1
In the United States, there have been four documented cases of @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$-related @di$ infections @/di$, which include three reports of bacteremia and one report of infective endocarditis. In this case report, we present the first documented case of urinary tract infection caused by @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$.	1
In the adjusted regression models, the bacterial burden index reflecting the total bacterial load was associated with moderate to severe @di$ periodontitis @/di$ with an OR of 2.40 (95% CI 1.39-4.13) (Table 5 and Figure 2). When A. actinomycetemcomitans was excluded from the combination of the bacteria, the OR was improved to 2.61 (95% CI 1.51-4.52). When P. intermedia was further excluded from the combination, and only the concentrations of P. gingivalis and @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ were used, the OR was increased to 3.59 (95% CI 1.94-6.63) (Table 5 and Figure 2). The bacteria to be excluded one-by-one from the model were chosen because they had the weakest association with @di$ periodontitis @/di$.	1
In the colon, the abundance of several OTUs belonging to Lactobacillus reuteri, Roseburia hominis, Roseburia intestinalis, Prevotella copri, Clostridium sartagoforme, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, and Lactobacillus rogosae was lower (p < 0.05) in the AH02LA group than that in the control group, whereas the abundance of OTU38 (Sphingomonas paucimobilis) was higher in the AH02LA group compared with control group (p < 0.05). The OTUs related to Kineothrix alysoides and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes were solely detected in the control group. Furthermore, in the ileum, the abundance of OTUs closely related to Actinobacillus porcinus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Campylobacter fetus, Desulfovibrio piger, Agathobacter ruminis, Parabacteroides johnsonii, and Lactococcus piscium were higher (p < 0.05) in piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ compared to piglets without @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (Figure S12). The OTUs related to Butyricimonas virosa, Sharpea azabuensis, Alistipes senegalensis and Tyzzerella nexilis were solely detected in the piglets with @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
In the context of @di$ CF @/di$, lemongrass oil (that contains about 65-85% citral) was found to inhibit the in vitro growth of drug resistant strains belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex. On P. aeruginosa, its effects ranged from negligible (MIC > 17 mg/mL) to mild (MIC = ~ 9 mg/mL). Other EOs known to contain citral (lemon, bergamot, orange, myrtle, and basil oils) yielded similar results on @di$ CF @/di$ or reference strains. Likely accounting for this poor activity, P. aeruginosa together with other Pseudomonas sp. such as P. citronellolis and @gm$ P. mendocina @/gm$, is able to degrade citral and to use it as sole source of carbon and energy.	1
In the context of @di$ obesity @/di$, the antimicrobial properties of (poly)phenols have been linked to the prevention of gut dysbiosis. Many gut opportunistic bacteria encountered in cases of @di$ obesity @/di$ and IBD are inhibited by (poly)phenol-enriched diets (Table 1). In line with this, a black raspberry phenolic extract inhibited 10 bacterial genera from the phylum Firmicutes, and especially Ruminococcus, while the abundance of A. muciniphila was increased 157-fold in C57BL/6J mice fed an obesogenic diet. Also, a 4-week oolong tea (poly)phenols treatment repressed gut dysbiosis in HFD-induced @di$ obesity @/di$ mouse model colonized with human gut microbiota; it increased the taxa of Prevotellaceae, and reduced Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and, Veillonellaceae. The dietary administration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to C57BL/6N mice fed an HFD, significantly lowered the abundance of the genera Mucispirillum, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and, Anaerotruncus, and significantly increased the abundance of the genera @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$, Akkermansia, Allobaculum, and Parabacteroides.	2
In the current study, the therapeutic potential of seven LAB strains in combination to treat IBD was evaluated using experimental @di$ colitis @/di$ model. This LAB cocktail, designated GI7, includes four strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, two strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, and one strain of @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$. We confirmed that GI7 suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in Raw264.7 macrophages. When dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitic mice were treated with GI7, their symptoms of @di$ colitis @/di$, as assessed by body weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase activity, intestinal bleeding, and histological damage, were reduced compared to untreated mice.	2
In the differential intestinal flora of the LVI and NLVI groups, g:Alistipes.s:@gm$ Alistipes_indistinctus @/gm$ was closely correlated with other dominant bacteria. Alistipes is a Gram-negative bacterium of the phylum Mycobacterium, and a relatively new genus of bacteria, isolated mainly from medical clinical samples. It has been suggested that Alistipes can act as a potential pathogen that may induce CRC. In addition, Alistipes has the most pathways of spoilage among commensal bacteria. Spoilage is the fermentation of undigested proteins in the gastrointestinal tract by the intestinal microbiota and usually results in the production of harmful metabolites by the bacteria. These products have been reported to be harmful and associated with CRC. Such products include ammonia, H2S, cresol, indole and phenol. It has also been shown that @gm$ Alistipes_indistinctus @/gm$ promotes inflammation and causes epithelial cell alterations, suggesting that this species is a potential driver of intestinal barrier @di$ dysfunction @/di$ and inflammation. Impaired intestinal barrier function contributes to the pathogenesis of CRC. Intestinal barrier @di$ dysfunction @/di$ can induce epithelial mesenchymal transformation and also allow harmful substances to enter the organism to induce chromosomal damage directly involved in tumorigenesis.	1
In the evaluable cases, treatment failure was associated with injections due to the following organisms: @gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$ (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) in the AZ group and @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$ (1) in the AM group. Superinfections were observed only in the AM group P. aeruginosa. @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$, Streptococcus viridans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Serratia marcescens. Both the peak and through serum concentrations of AZ and AM were maintained within normal ranges. Finally, an impairment of renal tubular function was observed in the group of patients treated with AM, as measured by urinary levels of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase sequentially during the treatment. These changes in renal functions alterations mentioned were not observed in the AZ group. It is concluded that the AZ + CE combination is an effective empirical and active antibiotic treatment against severe nosocomial pneumonia. Aztreonam has no renal toxicity, which is an advantage to take into account in patients with altered @di$ renal function @/di$.	1
In the human study, the @di$ deterioration of renal function @/di$ was retarded after 6 months of probiotic intervention. In addition, serum levels of endotoxin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-18 decreased, and there was an improvement in borborygmus, flatulence, and stool form, as well as increased abundance of @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ and B.	2
In the intestinal microbiota of individuals with @di$ ASD @/di$, the amount of bifidobacteria is reduced and there is abnormal growth of Clostridium species. Finegold et al. identified Desulfovibrio as the prevalent organism in the intestinal flora of these individuals and found that it modifies the bacterial ecosystem, reducing the presence of important species such as Bifidobacterium longum and @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$, which produce hydrogen sulfate, a gas that is toxic to humans.	2
In the latter, it can cause life-threatening chronic infections (pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related infections, burn wound infections, and @di$ sepsis @/di$) especially in patients with a weakened immune system. This bacterium is one of the six pathogens causing hospital ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter) infections, which readily develop resistance to antibiotics.	1
In the literature, there is also clear evidence that certain probiotics reduce the severity of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ caused by different pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and rotavirus; these studies support the potential of probiotics to attenuate the host response to infectious organisms. In the present study, although the accumulation of fluid in different sites of the intestine and the ETEC F4 count at the mucosal level were not affected by probiotic treatments, our results suggest that @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ and S. cerevisiae boulardii may interfere in certain conditions with ETEC F4 attachment to its receptor. In fact, the attachment of ETEC to specific F4 receptors in the ileum brings bacterial enterotoxins into close proximity with specific receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, other research recently showed in vitro that different strains of @gm$ Pediococcus @/gm$ have the potential to down regulate Shiga toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. In a further study, it would be interesting to determine whether @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ could modulate ETEC F4 enterotoxin gene expression and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ severity over a longer period of time post-challenge.	2
In the microbiome of early RA patients was observed a significant increase of Prevotella genus and Prevotella copri species, as well as a proliferation of Bacillus and @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in comparison to healthy controls. Moreover, Prevotella copri isolated from RA patients can worsen @di$ inflammation @/di$ in mice, which could support a causal role. Treatment with probiotics did not reach conclusive results on their possible beneficial effect: Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus have shown to decrease @di$ inflammatory @/di$ markers and disease activity, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus reuteri did not have significant effects on clinical improvement in active RA patients.	2
In the moderate CKD group, @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$, Alistipes inops, and Bacteroides uniformis levels decreased (Fig. 2A). In the ESRD group, the Turicibacter sanguinis level increased, but the Streptococcus mutans, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Lactobacillus crispatus levels decreased (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, microbial species, such as F. plautii, C. werkmanii, Ruminococcus spp., R. hominis, E. rectale, F. prausnitzii, and C. sporogenes, were closely associated with eGFR and serum Alb and Hb levels (Additional Fig. 1B and Additional Table 3). Among all clinical factors, hypertension, @di$ diabetes @/di$, serum albumin, and serum Hb significantly differed among the CKD groups; therefore, they were included as confounders in the multivariate analyses. However, the CCA found no association between CKD severity-related gut microbiome and hypertension, @di$ diabetes @/di$, or the albumin and Hb levels (P = 0.077, Additional Fig.	0
In the mouse model TMAO promotes the growth of atherosclerotic plaques and acts as @di$ uraemic @/di$ toxin. Microbial species can oppose the effects of TMAO such as @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$ and E.	2
In the present research, we aimed to test the potent inducers of Th1 responses, live-attenuated @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$  actA/ inlB strain as preventive/therapeutic vaccine candidate in @di$ liver fibrosis @/di$, HCC, and CCA. Studies were performed using autochthonous models of HCC and CCA, highly reflecting human disease. @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$  actA/ inlB demonstrated strong safety/efficacy in premalignant and malignant liver diseases. The protective mechanism relied on the induction of strong tumor-specific immune responses that keep the development of hepatobiliary cancers under control. Combination therapy, comprising Listeria vaccination and a checkpoint inhibitor blockade significantly extended the survival of HCC-bearing mice even at the advanced stages of the disease. This is the first report on the safety and efficacy of Listeria-based vaccine in @di$ liver fibrosis @/di$, as well as the first proof of principle study on Listeria-based vaccines in CCA. Our study paves the way for the use of live-attenuated Listeria as safe and efficient vaccine and a potent inducer of protective immune responses in @di$ liver fibrosis @/di$ and hepatobiliary malignancies.	2
"In the present study, the relative abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ and Bacillus pseudomallei in the stool of the patients in the depression group was significantly lower than that in the control group. @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ belongs to the thick-walled phylum. Kasai et al. observed that the abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ is closely associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ and can be involved in the metabolic process of converting polysaccharides into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). A decrease in @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ abundance tends to cause a decrease in SCFAs. SCFAs are not only an important source of energy for intestinal epithelial cells, but they also affect the intestinal mucosal barrier, permeability of intestinal epithelial cells, oxidative stress, and more. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reduced abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ in the intestine may be associated with increased intestinal mucosal permeability in patients with depression. In addition, SCFAs can also promote 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) secretion, enhance colonic contraction, and accelerate transmission; therefore, we hypothesized that a reduced abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ may also be associated with impaired gastro-dynamics in patients with depression. In conjunction with another study, it was found that the development of depression is associated with the dysregulation of central emotional neurotransmitters. For instance, low concentrations of ""happy"" substances, such as 5-HT, dopamine, and endorphins, as well as high concentrations of ""unpleasant"" molecules, may be associated with depression. It has been found that 5-HT is produced by intestinal chromophores in the gastrointestinal tract. In summary, we hypothesize that the decrease in SCFAs is caused by a decrease in @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$ abundance, causing a decrease in 5-HT secretion and a subsequent increase in intestinal mucosa permeability, gastric motility disorder, and depressed mood."	1
In the same study, the administration of @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ promoted the infiltration of IFN-gamma-producing gammadelta-T cells in the tumour. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with cisplatin and Lactobacillus bacteria up-regulated IFN-gamma, granzyme B and perforin-1 expression in a @di$ Lewis lung cancer @/di$ mouse model.	2
In the second step, Songbird was used to perform multinomial regression for the detection of donor-derived microbes that were associated with @di$ RMI @/di$. The log-ratio assessment of the Songbird differential rankings of donor-derived microbial profiles showed a clear, statistically significant difference between the R and NR groups (Fig. S4). As the analysis of the group 1 data sets showed, the predictors of @di$ RMI @/di$ included E. reclate, Acidaminococcus intestini, Collinsella aerofaciens, Roseburia intestinalis, @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$, and F. prausnitzii. Only Prevotella copri was consistently associated with @di$ UMI @/di$ (Fig. 2). Interestingly, E. rectale was a stronger predictor of @di$ RMI @/di$ for the FMT-related data sets, in comparison to F. prausnitzii. Firmicutes appeared to be beneficial in both data sets (maintaining a difference in the species content), whereas Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria demonstrated conflicting results in terms of their impacts on immunotherapy efficacy. For example, Bacteroides dorei and B. uniformis were strongly associated with @di$ RMI @/di$ in the Davar 2021 data set but not in the Baruch 2021 data set.	1
In their meta-analysis, Grin et al concluded that probiotic strains of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ are safe and effective in preventing @di$ RUTI @/di$ in adult women.  Barrons and Tassone concluded that intravaginal @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ suppositories are effective against uropathogens and show the greatest efficacy for @di$ UTI @/di$ prophylaxis.  In another study, the use of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ vaginal suppository in women resulted in the reduction of E.	2
In this case, after the patient has developed pneumonia and denied all other possible causes of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, it can be said that the same pathogen (@gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$) moved to the left femur by haematogenous pathway and caused @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$. @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, a Gram-positive, anaerobic, indole-negative coccus, is a common isolate of the normal flora of skin, the oral cavity and the gut and can also be isolated from human clinical specimens such as vaginal discharges and ovarian, peritoneal, sacral or lung abscesses. A review of the medical literature in English has not reported a single case in which @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$ caused hematogenous @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ complicated by pathological fractures in both femurs.	1
In this context, a study observed the impact of diet on the intestinal microbiota in @di$ GDM @/di$. Women aged 24-28 weeks who received dietary recommendations and experienced up to 38 weeks of gestation were included. There was a significant reduction in the adherence of Bacteroides, which is associated with diets rich in animal fat. In addition, at baseline, total fat intake was associated with higher amounts of Alistipes and protein intake with @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$. On the other hand, at the end of the research, fiber consumption was associated with the genus Roseburia. However, none of these bacteria were associated with the metabolic changes that occur in the @di$ GDM @/di$.	0
In this paper, isolation of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ from @di$ pleural effusion @/di$ in a male adult horse with respiratory symptoms is reported. Although a single isolation from a unique @di$ pleural effusion @/di$ sample has been performed, @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ grew in a monomicrobic growth. In humans, @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ is considered an emerging pathogen, while in animals its role is still unclear. The study carried out by Maatallah et al. (2014) reported that human bacteremia infections caused by @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ have higher 30-day mortality rates than those of infections caused by K. pneumoniae, suggesting the higher virulence of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$. Moreover, several researches estimate that around 10 % of K. pneumoniae isolated in human infections are misidentifications of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$. In literature, @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ has rarely been isolated in animals, in particular, among food-producing animals Podder and Colleagues (2014) evidenced that an isolate of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ can cause clinical mastisis in dairy cattle, as it is normally found in soil and feed, and not in milk from infected animals.	1
In this report, the oxidant AOPP increased 1.5-fold in the saliva of pigs affected by @gm$ S. suis @/gm$. In a recent study, increased concentrations of salivary AOPP were observed in pigs with experimentally induced @di$ sepsis @/di$, potentially attributed to the release of oxidant products during the @di$ sepsis @/di$ process.	1
In this study we compared subgingival plaque samples taken from gingivitis sites to those from inactive @di$ periodontitis @/di$ sites of the same patients. Of 44 patients plaque samples from 86 gingivitis sites and 92 @di$ periodontitis @/di$ sites were analysed. Darkfield microscopy showed a higher proportion of spirochetes and mobile rods in the @di$ periodontitis @/di$ sites. Analysis of cultures revealed a higher and statistically significant number of anaerobes in the @di$ periodontitis @/di$ sites (1.7 x 10(7) vs 3 x 10(6), p = 0.006). The following bacterial species were isolated more frequently from @di$ periodontitis @/di$ sites than from gingivitis sites: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (18% vs 10%), as well as the black-pigmented @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ (68% vs 48%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (48% vs 28%). On the one hand, these small differences in the bacteriological parameters can be explained by the fact that both gingivitis and @di$ periodontitis @/di$ plaque samples were taken from the same @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients.	1
In this study we identified immunodominant structures which were expressed in vivo during @di$ sepsis @/di$ caused by MRSA. Using human sera we compared the immune response of humans with MRSA @di$ sepsis @/di$ with the immune response of normal individuals and asymptomatically colonized individuals. We identified and characterized four staphylococcal specific antigenic structures. One target is a staphylococcal protein of 29 kDa that exhibited 29% identity to secreted protein SceA precursor of @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$.	1
In this study, 74 @gm$ S.typhimurium @/gm$ @di$ septicemia @/di$ cases were evaluated retrospectively from their records, and the age and sex distribution, presence of underlying disease, signs and symptoms, complete blood count, liver function tests and case fatality rate were documented and prognostic factors determined. It has been shown that @gm$ S.typhimurium @/gm$ is the most common strain causing Salmonella septicemia, which is more fatal in the newborn period and in the presence of an associated disease, while hemoglobin and leukocyte counts do not play an important role in the prognosis.	1
In this study, although pancreatic @di$ enlargement @/di$ was demonstrated by abdominal sonography in about half of patients, the course of pancreatitis was mild or moderate with complete recovery. However, many case reports of clinical severe acute pancreatitis during salmonellosis have been reported, suggesting that serious pancreatic disease may represent a complication of Salmonella infection. Similarly, acute pancreatitis has sporadically been reported during @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ enteritis as well as Rotavirus infection.	1
In this study, an increased F/B ratio and abundance of Lactobacillus intestinalis, @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$, and @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ were observed after administration of HD, which improved insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia and reduced the levels of circulating inflammatory factors, fat content and endotoxemia. Therefore, HD might regulate blood pressure and treat @di$ CHD @/di$ by regulating related factors.	2
In this study, in patients with PD and other comorbidities, the most abundant species was Akkermansia muciniphila, and in patients diagnosed only with PD, it was @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ which accords with the data from the literature. Akkermansia muciniphila is mucin-degrading bacteria enriched in neurodegenerative diseases (such as @di$ Alzheimer's disease @/di$ or multiple sclerosis) and contributes to the progression of neural pathologies by degrading mucin increasing gut inflammation and permeability, and finally leading to higher endotoxemia and systemic inflammation.	0
In this study, the bacterial species associated with @di$ dental caries @/di$ - detected at a significantly greater count in children with severe @di$ dental caries @/di$ - represent a very small proportion of the overall salivary microbiota. As such, these species were likely to shed from the plaque microbiota of @di$ carious lesions @/di$ and disrupted by paraffin wax for salivary collection. Thus, while oral microbes in a planktonic state are not usually regarded as direct casual agents of @di$ dental caries @/di$, understanding specific bacteria associated with the presence of active @di$ caries @/di$ can facilitate prevention and treatment, especially against those associated acidogenic and acidophilic species that are more likely to contribute to the @di$ caries @/di$ process. We found that L. salivarus, L. reuteri, L. gasseri, S. mutans, P. multisaccharivorax, P. denticolens, and @gm$ Mitsuokella @/gm$ HMT 131 were all significantly increased within the salivary microbiota of  children with severe @di$ carious lesions @/di$. L. salivarius and P. denticolens have been previously detected in saliva of individuals with progressive @di$ carious lesions @/di$ within multiple populations. Lactobacillus species are hypothesized to supervene the formation of the @di$ carious lesion @/di$, supporting downstream enamel demineralisation by more acidogenic species, such as S. mutans. The functional repertoire of Lactobacillus species (i.e. the ability to thrive in a low pH environment and produce lactic acids) suggests that its presence supports the development and severity of @di$ carious lesions @/di$. It is possible that Lactobacillus species play a more significant role in @di$ caries @/di$ development within this population than previously appreciated.	1
In this study, we detected @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$ in a @di$ diabetic @/di$ patient who developed EPN. Citrobacter infections typically occur in hospital settings in patients with multiple co-morbidities. In the majority of cases, patients are infected with Citobacter koseri and/or @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$. In most cases of infection with @gm$ Citrobacter @/gm$ species, a UTI (41 out of 78, 52.5%) was the most common clinical diagnosis; further, 30 of these patients had acute pyelonephritis, 3 had acute cystitis, and 8 had bacteriuria. Citrobacter infections (C. koseri, 90.2%; @gm$ C. freundii @/gm$, 9.8%) are generally described as uncomplicated UTIs (46.2%). Furthermore, renal abscess have been associated with an ascending infection and rarely with @gm$ Citrobacter @/gm$ species.	1
In this study, we established a @di$ protein-overload nephropathy @/di$ CKD mouse model by bovine serum albumin (BSA) injection to investigate whether hyperlipidemia could accelerate CKD progression and the underlying mechanisms. Finasteride was administrated to explore its potential therapeutic effects. The results of biochemical analyses and pathological examination showed that HFD-induced hyperlipidemia led to aggravated @di$ protein-overload nephropathy @/di$ in mice along with an elevated level of circulating TMAO, which can be alleviated by finasteride treatment possibly through inhibition of Fmo3 in liver. The 16 S rRNA sequencing results indicated that HFD feeding altered the composition and distribution of gut microbiota in CKD mice contributing to the enhanced level of TMAO precursor TMA, while finasteride could exert beneficial effects via promoting the abundance of @gm$ Alistipes_senegalensis @/gm$ and Akkermansia_muciniphila. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) and qRT-PCR results demonstrated the disruption of intestinal barrier by decreased expression of tight junction proteins including Claudin-1 and Zo-1 in HFD-fed CKD mice, which can be rescued by finasteride treatment. Cytokine arrays and redox status analyses revealed an upregulated inflammatory level and oxidative stress after HFD feeding in CKO mice, and finasteride-treatment could alleviate these lesions. To summarize, our study suggested that finasteride could alleviate HFD-associated deterioration of @di$ protein-overload nephropathy @/di$ in mice by inhibition of TMAO synthesis and regulation of gut microbiota.	2
In this study, we have examined the current accuracy of two widely available commercial MALDI-TOF systems - Biotyper and VITEK MS - when challenged with isolates from 23  Burkholderia  species comprising 22/23 species as part of the Bcc, along with  @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ , the other main  Burkholderia  pathogen in @di$ CF @/di$.	0
In this study, we isolated @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ strain WUSP074 from a healthy pig tonsil, and mice infection experiments revealed that the strain was non-pathogenic. Whether, like S. suis, some tonsillar-derived @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ strains are pathogenic and serve as a source of infection warrants further study. In addition, strain WUSP070 was isolated from cattle feces with @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Trotta et al. isolated two strains from calves with neurological hyperacute symptoms in 2019. If @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ can cause cattle @di$ diarrhea @/di$ needs further research.	0
In this study, we observed that the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ was significantly increased in the case group compared with the matched control group. Previous studies found that this increase correlates with elevated concentrations of molecules including lipopolysaccharides, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, and arachidonic acid. High levels of this bacteria can also activate the slow inflammatory response in the liver through the TLR4 signaling pathway, causing liver disease. However, more research is required to fully reveal the relationship between @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ and @di$ liver fibrosis @/di$.	1
In this study, we performed a three-week IF intervention in 72 Chinese adult participants with different body weights, ranging from regular to @di$ obese @/di$, and revealed pronounced improvements in multiple clinical parameters, including body weight, body mass index (BMI), and the atherosclerosis index (AI). IF-induced changes in the taxonomic composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota, and correlation between these changes and the clinical improvements were investigated based on a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach. The results suggested that a short-term 5:2 IF intervention induced significant changes in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in a baseline independent manner, associated with an increase in the relative abundance of species considered beneficial, including Parabacteroides distasonis and @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, which may confer weight loss and improvements in host metabolism through the synthesis, and secretion of beneficial metabolites.	2
In this work, we focused on @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$, a species of Firmicutes that belongs to microbiomes of all humans and contributes to the maintenance of oral, pharyngeal and gut health. Some @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ strains are also described as opportunistic pathogens since they have been associated with cases of meningitis, endocarditis and @di$ bacteremia @/di$ in immunocompromised patients. @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ genomes are known to evolve rapidly, presumably through HGT. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence of the pivotal role played by conjugative and/or mobilizable elements in @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ HGT. In a previous study, we highlighted the occurrence of ICEs belonging to the ICESt3 family in 13 @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ genomes. In this work, we enlarged the number of @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ genomes analyzed (n = 75) and searched not only for ICESt3 elements but also made an exhaustive search of the diversity and abundance of all ICE and IME families. We delimited almost all the identified elements, precisely defined their insertion site and searched for CIMEs that are integrated in tandem with ICEs and IMEs. We also characterized the adaptive functions carried by these mobile elements. Altogether, these data shed light on the diversity and prevalence of ICEs and IMEs in @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$. They also make a comprehensive picture of the role of these mobile elements in @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ adaptation to the environment.	1
In tuberculous meningitis (TM), @gm$ Mycobacterium tuberculosis @/gm$ and, more rarely, M. bovis (MB), formerly known as M. bovis ssp. bovis, have been reported as pathogens. Clinically, TM should be suspected in patients presenting a progressive, subacute illness with headache, meningism, cranial-nerve involvement and hydrocephalus development potentially leading to stupor and @di$ coma @/di$.	1
In vivo and in vitro, after being challenged with @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ or grass carp reovirus (GCRV), gctlr20.2 expression was induced in C. idella kidney cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, flagellin or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Overexpression of gctlr20.2 increased the expression of il1beta, il8 and tnf-alpha, but not ifn, and also increased the activity of the nf-kappaB signal pathway. Silencing, via siRNA-tlr20.2, inhibited gctlr20.2 transcription by 65.7% and down-regulated the expression of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokine genes, but not tnf-alpha.	1
In young adults, elevated gut bacterial diversity was found in lean, when compared with their corresponding @di$ obese @/di$ co-twin and in athletes, when compared with sedentary controls. Calf circumference (as an indirect index of muscle mass) was reduced in frail, when compared with less frail older adults in association with elevated abundances of family-level Enterobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, whereas genus-level @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ were decreased.	2
In363 was initially characterized in the SGI2 resistance island from @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ enteric serovar Emerk, and is organized as follows: IRi, 5'-CS, GCA (dfrA1 (@di$ dihydrofolate @/di$ resistance)-gcuC (unknown function)), Delta3'-CS (qacED1-Deltasul1), the In0 (an empty class 1 integron)-ISCR3-tetA(G) (class G tetracycline resistance)-cmlA9 (chloramphenicol resistance) region, and IRi-IS6100-IRt-Deltatni (DeltatniB-tniA)-IRt.	0
Inclusion criteria were: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of MDS or AML, and hospitalization at the UMMC Greenebaum Comprehensive @di$ Cancer @/di$ Center between August 2011 and December 2013. Charts were reviewed for demographics, clinical information, development of CDI, complications of CDI, and mortality. The starting point of data collection was identified as August 2011, when UMMC began to utilize the illumigene  @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ DNA amplification assay (Meridian Bioscience, Inc.). The assay uses loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification to detect the tcdA 5' region present in all toxigenic @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$, and has a sensitivity and specificity of 95.2% and 95.3%, respectively.	0
Incorrect development or disruption of this microbial community contributes to disorders such as @di$ Necrotising Enterocolitis @/di$, infantile diarrhoea and Group B streptococcal neonatal infection. Strikingly, the faecal microbiota of healthy breastfed infants is enriched for certain species of the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus, which are high-G+C Gram-positive anaerobes and members of the Actinobacteria phylum.	2
Indeed, Proteus was completely absent, supporting the hypothesis that it may be associated only with more moderate clinical conditions of @di$ UC @/di$. R. gnavus decreased after FMT, increased at T2, showing a trend completely independent from the patient's symptoms. Moreover, Parabacteroides, Mogibacteriaceae, B. eggerthi, B. plebeius, @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$, and B.	0
Indeed, in the research of Kanauchi and co-workers, @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ was presented as an important probiotic candidate for its short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, role in maintaining and enhancing mucosal integrity, and anti-inflammatory properties in the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, Bruzzese et al. found that both E. rectale and F. prausnitzii were reduced in the GM of @di$ CF @/di$ children compared to HC, confirming our results.	2
Indeed, it has been suggested that @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ is able to survive and be transmitted to the consumer via contaminated raw meat from @di$ infected @/di$ chicken. Several studies have shown considerable genetic similarities between strains of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ infecting humans, swine, and poultry, suggesting an ability to adapt to various hosts. In 2012, Mappley et al. carried out a genetic comparison of three strains of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ isolated from humans, chickens, and pigs, respectively. This study showed that the genotype of these three strains were very similar. However, some differences were noted in the genome size and arrangement and in some putative coding regions for carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism and transport. These data highlighted some fundamental genetic differences that are reflected in their phenotype and may have implications in host specificity and interspecies transmission, although this has remained untested till date. More structural rearrangements were observed in the strains isolated from chicken and human in comparison to the strains isolated from pig. Despite these variations, the functional genome comparison showed a high level of similarity in the features of the three strains except for the aforementioned transporters and enzymes. Additionally, genes involved in membrane fixation and in beta-haemolysis were common to the three strains, which suggests a similar invasion and @di$ infection @/di$ process between the bacteria. These genetic and phenotypic data indicate a high degree of similarity in @di$ infection @/di$ processes across species and may support the potential of transmission of bacteria causing IS from farm animals to humans and, therefore, is a realistic issue that requires attention.	1
Indeed, it has been suggested that stress and a prior gastrointestinal infection are considered significant risk factors for the development of IBS, and stress may contribute to the development of @di$ septicemia @/di$, following bacterial infection. Host stress results in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to the increased production of stress neuroendocrine hormones, including catecholamines and glucocorticoids, which can enter the gastrointestinal tract, coming into contact with the local microbiome. Previous studies have shown that catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine have resulted in increased pathogenicity in a number of bacteria, including @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ spp., Escherichia coli, Yersinia spp., Vibrio spp.	1
"Indeed, of the six secreted proteins unique to cultivation in urine, two, EF0577 and EF2076, are homologous to known streptococcal adhesins such as SsaB from Streptococcus sanguis and FimA from @gm$ S. parasanguis @/gm$. EF0577 is currently annotated as ""Adhesion lipoprotein"" and is located in the pathogenicity island of V583. EF2076 is annotated as ""Endocarditis specific antigen"" (EfaA), a well-known virulence factor of E. faecalis originally detected in connection with studies of @di$ endocarditis @/di$."	1
Individuals with @di$ obesity @/di$-induced T2D are prone to Staphylococcus aureus-mediated bone infection (osteomyelitis) after orthopedic surgery. Studies on the tibial wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus in the mice model showed that infection levels were reduced after treatment with oligofructose and subsequently there was an increase in levels of gut @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$ which has an anti-inflammatory effect.	2
Induction of T regulatory cells by @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ 35624 strain (35624) in mice is associated with protection against @di$ colitis @/di$, arthritis, allergic responses and pathogen-induced inflammation.	2
Infected @di$ SFA aneurysms @/di$ are much rarer, especially those caused by Campylobacter fetus bacteremia. We report a case of a 67-year-old woman referred to our hospital owing to the presence of a painful reddish swelling on her left thigh. A huge SFA aneurysm rupture was diagnosed, and endovascular treatment with a covered stent was performed. @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ was detected in the blood culture thereafter, and antibacterial therapy was successfully performed without any additional surgical interventions.	1
Infection by @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ results in either non-invasive gastrointestinal listeriosis among immunocompetent individuals or invasive listeriosis among immunocompromised people. Invasive listeriosis leads to abortion in pregnant women and @di$ meningitis @/di$ in immunocompromised individuals. During the 2017-2018 listeriosis outbreak in South Africa, a 42% fatality rate was recorded, with more than 1000 laboratory-confirmed cases, and the most infected were infants and pregnant women. Individuals on medications that minimize gastric acidity as well as chronic renal failure and cirrhosis patients are also at risk. Also, Listeria-related urinary tract infections were reported in an incident wherein @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ was detected in urine samples.	1
Infection with @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ usually remains unnoticed when the dog does not have reproductive activity. Frequent findings in canine brucellosis during physical examination include long term enlargement of lymph nodes, especially the submandibular and retropharyngeal. The epididymis may be enlarged and firm, with scrotal dermatitis, and testicular atrophy. @di$ Orchitis @/di$ has also been reported in @gm$ B. canis @/gm$ infection, and although testicular swelling is infrequent and usually not detectable, pain on gentle palpation of testicles or epididymis may be noticed, and distention of tunica vaginalis cavity with fibrinopurulent exudate has been reported.	1
Infections by strains belonging to the O3:K6 pandemic clone of @gm$ Vibrio parahaemolyticus @/gm$ are prevalent in southern Thailand, and serovariants of these strains have also been detected. @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ strains lacking important virulence genes (tdh and trh) were isolated from 6.5 to 10.9% of clinical specimens during the period from 2000 to 2003. In order to understand whether changes to the characteristics of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ occur during infection, 10 isolates collected from each of 63 patients who presented with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ at the Hat Yai hospital from 2003 to 2004 were examined for the presence of the tdh and trh genes, the O:K serotype, and genetic markers for the pandemic clone.	1
Infections due to @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$ and Plesiomonas shigelloides in immuno-compromised hosts have been well documented, but the role of these organisms in causing gastrointestinal disease in healthy persons is controversial. Despite difficulties in characterizing the exotoxins produced by Aeromonas species, there is accumulating evidence that these bacteria are capable of causing usually mild, self-limited diarrheal disease in previously healthy adults. Some pediatric patients may have protracted dysenteric symptoms. P. shigelloides, an organism closely related to Aeromonas species, may also cause @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in the healthy host, but no exotoxins have yet been identified by the assays used to identify other bacterial enterotoxins.	1
"Infections with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ are particularly common in intensively housed pigs and chickens, in which they cause depressed rates of growth and production. Colonization also commonly occurs in human beings living in crowded and unhygienic conditions in developing countries, as well as amongst homosexual males. Individuals colonized with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ may develop focal colitis and chronic diarrhoea, with abdominal pain, @di$ failure to thrive @/di$ and rectal bleeding. An in vitro study using Caco-2 cells has shown that @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ strains initially target the cell junctions, where one cell end of the spirochaete invaginates into the Caco-2 cell membranes. The whole cell surface progressively becomes colonized by attached spirochaetes, forming a ""false brush border"". In this model colonized monolayers demonstrated accumulation of actin at the cell junctions, loss of tight junction integrity, condensation and fragmentation of nuclear material consistent with apoptosis, and a significant up-regulation of interleukin-1beta and interleukin-8 expression. Besides colitis, a spirochaetaemia with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ has been recorded in immunocompromised or debilitated human beings, and systemic spread involving the liver also has been described in experimentally infected chickens."	1
Infections with NTM have significant impacts on cultured and wild food fishes and laboratory fish (Brocklebank et al., ; Rhodes et al., ; Whipps et al., ) and are associated with multiple symptoms, such as weight loss, @di$ skin ulceration @/di$ and granulomas in the liver, kidney and spleen (Ferguson, ; Noga, ). Both freshwater and marine fishes are considered susceptible to NTM, most commonly @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$, M. fortuitum and M. chelonae (Gauthier & Rhodes, ). In addition to its impact on fish health, @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ is a potential zoonotic since it produces granulomatous lesions in human skin (Tomas et al., ), usually following exposure to infected fish surfaces (Jernigan & Farr, ) and is also a risk factor for pneumonia (Oh et al., ).	1
Infectious keratitis can be described as an acute or chronic condition in which infection and inflammation of the cornea occur which is accompanied by pain, light sensitivity, reduced vision, tearing, @di$ swelling around the eyes @/di$ and even loss of vision in severe cases. The disease progresses very rapidly and can cause the destruction of cornea completely within 24-48 hours with some virulent bacteria. Infectious keratitis can take many forms like Bacterial keratitis mainly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$, Fungal keratitis caused by Aspergillus, Candida or Fusarium, Parasitic keratitis caused by Acanthamoeba and viral keratitis primarily caused by herpes simplex virus. Bacterial keratitis is at the top in causing vision-threatening keratitis. It is characterized by an interruption of epithelium cells of cornea that permits the entrance of bacterias like, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ which invade the corneal stroma.	1
Inflammation is one of the common factors causing @di$ fever @/di$ or hypothermia; but many studies have focused on @di$ fever @/di$ rather than hypothermia. Many antipyretic drugs, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, with potent and rapid effects, have been developed for clinical use. However, the mechanism underlying the development of hypothermia is unknown; there are few therapeutic methods and most involve heating by physical methods. This may be due to hypothermia is not common, and warm keeping is the best measure to treat hypothermia caused by cold and trauma. Meanwhile, hypothermia, caused by systemic inflammation, comes from severe diseases such as septicemia, and the focus of treatment is not on the body temperature. Even so, hypothermia caused by inflammation, like @di$ fever @/di$, is worth studying. LPS is a component of Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis, @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ are also belonging to Gram-negative bacteria; pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plague caused by Yersinia pestis, dysentery caused by @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ and some other diseases not only have inflammatory reaction, but also have @di$ fever @/di$ or hypothermia with the change of disease condition.	1
Ingestion of food contaminated with @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ can lead to gastrointestinal illness, including symptoms such as watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache and/or @di$ bloody diarrhoea @/di$. Open wounds in contact with @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ may also result in wound infection and life-threatening septicemia. Based on the number of vibriosis infections reported to the Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance (COVIS) system and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1996 to 2014, @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ was identified as the most common foodborne pathogen which caused 39-51% of Vibrio infection compared to other Vibrio species such as V. vulnificus, V. cholerae (non-O1 and non-O139), V. alginolyticus, V. fluvialis, V. mimicus, and V. hollisae. The high infection rate caused by @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ results in high medical costs worldwide. For example, the annual health cost of ingestion of seafood contaminated with @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ in the United States was estimated to be $21 million.	1
Initial blood cultures were positive for @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ on day five. Metronidazole and clindamycin were added to the regimen. Repeat CT (day 7) revealed pancreatic necrosis. The patient developed profound circulatory shock requiring multiple vasopressors, @di$ renal failure @/di$ requiring dialysis, and bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Hemodynamic instability precluded surgical intervention and he succumbed to @di$ multiorgan failure @/di$.	1
Initial intraoperative biopsy and surgical pathology results were concerning for an acid-fast bacillus as the causative pathogen, and the patient was given empiric therapy for presumed Mycobacterium tuberculosis However, microbiology speciation revealed the presence of the @di$ non-tuberculous mycobacterium @/di$ (@di$ NTM @/di$) @gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$, which resulted in an alteration of his antimicrobial therapy. This case highlights the importance of considering @di$ NTM @/di$ as a possible aetiology of spinal osteomyelitis, even among immunocompetent individuals or in low-prevalence regions.	1
Initially isolated from the alimentary canal of a Japanese corbicula clam, @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ is a Gram-negative rod, of which culture remains very difficult. Herein we present the first case of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ due to @gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$, in humans. A 55-year-old man was hospitalized for clinical management of multiple neglected leg wounds (colonized with maggots) that had occurred during a motorcycle accident. Following radiological confirmation of the bone infection, a transfemoral amputation was performed to limit the risk of extended infection. During hospitalization, before the amputation, the patient experienced fever, biological inflammation justifying the sampling of multiple blood cultures. Anaerobic blood culture was positive after 34 hours, without identification by routine procedure (MALDI-TOF), justifying identification by 16S DNA sequencing. In the absence of possible subculture, antibiotic sensitivity testing could not be performed. A pre-emptive treatment by piperacillin-tazobactam was introduced for 14 days. The evolution was good, except for a local disunion. Complete phylogenic analysis of the clinical strain showed that it significantly differed from the reference strain, which is distantly related to the Clostridia cluster IV. Due to the culture conditions and specialized identification method by sequencing, prevalence of @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ may be underestimated.	1
Interestingly, non-viable microorganisms from the archaea domain, namely methanogens from the Methanobacteriacaea group (@gm$ Methanobrevibacter @/gm$ or Methanosphaera genus), were found in high concentrations (up to 108 archaea/m3) in bioaerosols from poultries, dairy farms and swine confinement buildings (Nehme et al. 2009; Blais-Lecours et al. 2012; Just et al. 2013). Furthermore, a mouse model of @di$ lung inflammation @/di$ induced by crude extracts of these methanogens was recently developed and demonstrated species-dependent lung immune responses to Methanosphaera stadtmanae (MSS) and @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ (@gm$ MBS @/gm$), with MSS being the more potent inducer (Blais-Lecours et al.	1

Interestingly, our previous results implicated bacterial metabolism as key to chronic @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ infection. Therefore, we sought to investigate the relative importance of AAM and CAM as niches for persistent @di$ infection @/di$, and to determine whether the different metabolic programming of these two macrophage populations contributes to chronic @di$ infection @/di$ by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$.	1
Interestingly, revealed that in the first 3 months after transplantation, 47 (33%) of 142 kidney transplant recipients developed @di$ diarrhea @/di$ after transplantation, of which 24 recipients exhibited extensive microbial colonization. reported differences in the diversity of the gut microbiota between healthy individuals and kidney transplant recipients. The latter exhibited an increase in Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Lachnoclostridiumand a decrease in Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, Romboutsia, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Fusicatenibacter, Oscillibacter, Ruminiclostridium, Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides. also reported that an increase in Faecalibacterium abundance was positively correlated with future tacrolimus dosing at 1 month. reported an increasing trend in the abundance of Proteobacteria and a lower abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Gemmiger formicilis, Eubacterium rectale, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Coprococcus comes, and Roseburia . This study also reported the depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria caused by antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents and this was considered to be associated with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ after kidney transplant. reported increased abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae, and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and Alcaligenaceae in a 32-year-old kidney transplant recipient. These findings reveal that butyrate-producing bacteria are lost in RTRs. @di$ Diarrhea @/di$ after transplantation was not associated with common infectious diarrheal pathogens but with dysbiosis.	1

Interestingly, the relative abundance of genera Clostridium and @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ was negatively correlated to the size of MLN. Clostridium is a genus with butyrate-producing gram-positive bacteria. Known to exert beneficial effects for intestinal homeostasis, Clostridium spp. can have an important role in attenuating inflammation due to their cellular components and metabolites, likely through energizing intestinal epithelial cells, stimulating intestinal barrier health, and educating the immune system. Moreover, a member of the @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ genus, @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$, is a valerate- and butyrate-producing anaerobic gram-negative non-sporulating bacterium. O. valericigenes has been found in the human gut microbiota. In particular, @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ was found more abundant in healthy individuals compared to patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease. An important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate has been shown to successfully prevent inflammation through Treg induction and down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, it is conceivable, while yet to be elucidated, that the negative correlation between @di$ mesenteric lymphadenopathy @/di$ and the genera Clostridium and @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ may be due to the ability of the bacteria to produce the anti-inflammatory butyrate. It is likely that the presence or products of Lactobacillus spp. facilitated the proliferation and/or survival of these two genera, even though we do not know the mechanisms at this time. It is known, however, that Lactobacillus spp. are SCFA producers and can be butyrate-producing bacteria that alleviate intestinal permeability and maintain barrier function. Butyrate can not only inhibit pathogenic bacteria but also stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria, a notion that could be associated with the enhancement of the relative abundance of @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ and Clostridium.	2
Interestingly, we also observed a bloom of the polyphenols-degrading family Coriobacteriaceae, in particular of @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$, which suggest their involvement in the metabolism of polyphenols, which is particularly relevant as it can generate bioactive molecules involved into the amelioration of metabolic disturbances in obesity and diabetes. Our study also unraveled the important role that polymeric PACs play on the gut epithelial barrier function, especially promoting a thicker mucus layer, possibly through increasing mucin-secreting GC number, as well as mediating non-insulin dependent intestinal glucose response in obese mice. While the administration of WBE attenuated HFHS-induced @di$ glucose tolerance @/di$, only the F3 fraction replicated this effect, even though this fraction was in lower proportion in the whole WBE.	2
Interestingly, we found that @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$, a non-pathogenic carbohydrate metabolizing member of Spirochaetes associated with a high-fiber diet, is progressively reduced in the fecal microbiome despite long-term ART. A similar early decrease of the genus Treponema was noted in SIV-infected macaques by Siddiqui et al. with subsequent recovery by 2 months of viral suppression with ART. The effects of chronic SIV-ART, particularly on @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ are, however, unknown in HIV/SIV infection. A common constituent of healthy nonhuman primate gut, @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ is found in rural or traditional human populations and is lacking or in low abundance in urban populations likely due to low-fiber diets, or other factors such as frequent antibiotic use. @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ has been shown to be maintained at a higher abundance in the fecal microbiome of healthy infant rhesus macaques in contrast to those with recurrent @di$ diarrhea @/di$, further indicating their association with healthy gut function. Thus, the linear decrease in our study animals as they progressed through chronic SIV-ART and inverse correlations with inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and G-CSF as well as markers of epithelial barrier damage (Figure 6 and Figure 7) point toward a link between @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ with gut homeostasis via metabolite production and anti-inflammatory function.	2
Intestinal @di$ parasites @/di$ were diagnosed by microscopy. RESULTS: Rotavirus was the most common enteric pathogen, detected in 27% of patients, followed by Shigella (12%), diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (8%), enteric adenovirus (8%), Salmonella (4%), Campylobacter jejuni (3%) and @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ (2%). Mixed bacterial/viral infections were detected in 6% of cases. @di$ Parasites @/di$, mostly protozoa, were detected in 14% of children.	1
Intestinal bacteria are critical for regulating allergic responses to dietary antigens and this suggests that interventions modulating bacterial communities are therapeutically relevant for @di$ food allergy @/di$. According to a very recent study, the presence of a Clostridiales taxa @gm$ Anaerostipes @/gm$ (i.e., in particular the species @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$) has been associated with a reduction of the risk of @di$ food allergy @/di$ in infant. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition seems to play a role in @di$ food allergy @/di$ resolution in infants suffering from cow's milk protein allergy.	2
Intravenous and footpad infections with @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ and footpad infections with M. leprae were compared in the following mouse strains: A/He, BALB/C, CBA, C3H, C57BL, C57L, DBA, 101, and CFW. The results varied a great deal according to mouse strain used. Intravenous injection of high doses of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ resulted in deaths after 28 days of 100% of strain A/He, and none of strain 101; 27 days after injection, the feet and noses of all strain CBA mice, but few of the C57BL, 101, or CFW mice, were involved. Injection of a small dose of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ into the footpad produced visible disease in 5 days in all of the C57BL and 101 mice, but in not more than 60% of the A/He, DBA, and CFW mice; the average amount of @di$ swelling @/di$ at 17 days varied from 4.40 mm in strain C57L to 0.92 in strain 101. After footpad injection of M. leprae, the average plateau harvests varied from 1.3 x 10(7) acid-fast bacteria in strain CBA to 6.5 x 10(5) in strain C57L. The infections in CBA mice extended from the site of inoculation throughout the foot. The temperature was measured rectally, in the footpad, and in the tail. Analysis of all the results revealed little correlation among the three types of infection. There was a strong negative correlation between the tail temperature and the death rate after intravenous injection of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$, and a strong positive correlation between footpad temperature and plateau harvest of M.	1
Intriguingly, one archaeal species (@gm$ MSS @/gm$) also led to eosinophilic inflammation. In view that eosinophilic inflammation is usually associated with the development of @di$ asthma @/di$ and that archaeal species induce a strong T cell response, it is tempting to speculate that archaeal species might be linked to the development of exposure-related airway diseases including HP and occupational @di$ asthma @/di$. Moreover, our study reveals that not only the nature, but also the dose of the inhaled agent could determine the nature of an exposure-related respiratory disease, with increasing doses of @gm$ MSS @/gm$ leading to a downregulation of eosinophil accumulation in the airways. Mechanisms of eosinophilic inflammation downregulation by increasing doses of @gm$ MSS @/gm$ are currently being investigated.	2
Inulin, indeed, reaches the colon unaltered, where it is fermented by beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, determining the release of short-chain fatty acids in the gut and a pH lowering which, in turn, enhances the absorption of minerals (Ca2+ and Mg2+), nutrients, and increases the functionality of colonocytes. Moreover, regular consumption of prebiotics has shown several health benefits like modulation of @di$ hyperglycemia @/di$, reduction of LDL cholesterol and serum lipids, prevention of colorectal cancer, and enhancement of immune system efficiency.	2
Investigations revealed that it was caused by @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ 4/O:3. Approximately 30 people fell ill; 12 patients had culture-confirmed, multiresistant YE 4/O:3 infection. Three of them had appendectomies before the disease was recognized as yersiniosis. Most of the patients had abdominal pain (94%), fever (78%), and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (72%). Most of the patients had eaten in the same cafeteria in the Port of Kotka between November 25 and December 15, 2003. However, the contaminated food source was not discovered, as the food served in that cafeteria was no longer available for microbiological investigations. In addition, a cohort study among cafeteria users did not show a significant association between any food and illness. During a microbiological sampling of the cafeteria's kitchen a month later, in January 2004, hygienists noticed some shortcomings in food handling and hygiene practices that increased the possibility of cross-contamination in the cafeteria. While no @gm$ YE @/gm$ 4/O:3 strains were found in the specimens collected from the cafeteria, @gm$ YE @/gm$ biotype 1A strains were isolated from iceberg lettuce imported from Spain and from domestic carrots. Unfortunately, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of these strains are not known. At the time of the outbreak in Kotka, there were around 20 confirmed @gm$ YE @/gm$ 4/O:3 cases in other locations in Finland, mainly in the Turku area.	1
Isolated @di$ meningitis @/di$ as the first manifestation of endocarditis is unusual. Fewer than 80 cases of @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ endocarditis have been reported in the literature, and in a previous review, only one case of an embolic event in the meninges was reported.	1
It acts as an opportunistic pathogen to cause a wide spectrum of infection including nosocomial pneumonia, @di$ meningitis @/di$, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infection, conjunctivitis, burn wound infection and bacteremia. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection creates a great problem in hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU and different surgical and medical wards were investigated using standard microbiological techniques to know the distribution of and their resistant profile. Antimicrobial resistance was studied using the modified Kirby Bauer disk diffusion technique following the CLSI protocol. RESULTS: Major infections found in different medical wards, surgical wards and ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii (74.02%), A. lowfii (14.2%), A. haemolyticus (7.79%), @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ (3.8%) among Acinetobacter spices. Acinetobacter showed increased resistant against majority of commercially available drugs imipenem (5.2%), meropenem (9.75%), piperacillin-tazobactum (18.2%), netilmicin (16.24%), amikacin (14.29%), ceftazidime (74.1%), gentamicin (70.13%), ofloxacin (42.21%). CONCLUSION: A. baumannii was found to be associated with UTI, RTI, septicemia, bacteremia, and @di$ meningitis @/di$ and wound infection.	1
It acts as an opportunistic pathogen to cause a wide spectrum of infection including nosocomial pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$, conjunctivitis, burn wound infection and bacteremia. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection creates a great problem in hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU and different surgical and medical wards were investigated using standard microbiological techniques to know the distribution of and their resistant profile. Antimicrobial resistance was studied using the modified Kirby Bauer disk diffusion technique following the CLSI protocol. RESULTS: Major infections found in different medical wards, surgical wards and ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii (74.02%), A. lowfii (14.2%), A. haemolyticus (7.79%), @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ (3.8%) among Acinetobacter spices.	1
It can manifest as undulating fever with arthralgia, sometimes associated with chronic and severe complications (e.g., @di$ orchitis @/di$, spondylitis, and arthritis) and remains as a common cause of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). Meanwhile, the symptoms of infection in animals include abortion, infertility, and decreased production. Brucella spp. are Gram-negative, facultative, and intracellular pathogens with 10 different species-specific host preferences (e.g., Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis, @gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$, Brucella canis, Brucella neotomae, etc.).	1
It has been generally recognized that gut microbiota clearly differs between, genetically- or diet-induced, lean and @di$ obese @/di$ phenotypes. Genetic predisposition to @di$ obesity @/di$ associated to leptin (ob/ob mice) or leptin receptor (db/db mice) deficiencies appear to shape a microbiota specialized for enhanced dietary energy recovery with elevated abundance of Firmicutes and reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes compared with lean mice. A closer look at the specific enriched or depleted genus or species shows a significant variability depending on the representative sequence used in the analysis and on other confounding factors (e.g. sex, age, diet composition, environmental factors, etc). Leptin receptor-deficient Zucker male @di$ obese @/di$ rats exhibited lower total bacteria but higher levels of Lab158 (most Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus among other genus) and Erec482 (most members of Clostridium cluster XIVa) and no differences in Bac303 (most Bacteroides and Prevotella) compared to Zucker male lean rats. In our study, the levels of total bacteria were similar in the @di$ obese @/di$ and lean female Zucker rats. We corroborated that the @di$ obese @/di$ rats displayed elevated numbers of some members of the Firmicutes group, Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus and @gm$ B. coccoides @/gm$, compared with their lean counterparts whereas the C. leptum and the Bacteroidetes groups were lower (although did not reach significance) in the @di$ obese @/di$ rats. The saccharolytic Bifidobacterium genus, generally considered beneficial bacteria, has also been inversely associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ but while Waldram et al confirmed lower levels of Bif164 (targeting most bifidobacteria) in the @di$ obese @/di$ male Zucker rats, our results show the opposite reinforcing the potential effects of other variables in the microbiota (i.e. sex, diet, age, etc) and the difficulty of establishing definitive differences between @di$ obese @/di$ and lean phenotypes.	1
It has been previously demonstrated that @gm$ Blautia obeum @/gm$ expresses bile salt hydrolases that have been shown to suppress C. difficile germination in animal models. Another important player is Akkermansia muciniphila, which has been inversely associated with mucosal membrane pathology in multiple gastrointestinal disorders. Specifically, Akkermansia spp. are important for mucin degradation, and their relative absence is associated with @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease in both human cohorts and animal models (reviewed in).	2
It has been reported that, compared with healthy patients, the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ in the intestines of patients with @di$ psoriasis @/di$ is increased, while that of the Porphyromonadaceae family, to which Parabacteroides distasonis belongs, is decreased.	1
It has been shown that dogs with acute @di$ hemorrhagic diarrhea @/di$ have alterations in their intestinal microbiome. Bacterial taxa most commonly altered include increases in C. perfringens and E. coli, and decreases in Blautia, Turicibacter, Faecalibacterium, and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ spp.	1
It is a 50 kDa protease secreted by the bacterium @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$ and related strains found in soil. BoNTs have found extensive use in cosmetics and therapeutics for an increasing number of indications, including pain management, urinary incontinence, and muscle spasms. While the use of BoNTs is generally considered safe, off-target effects and adverse events can result in anaphylaxis, muscle weakness, @di$ dysphagia @/di$, and iatrogenic botulism. BoNTs A, B, and, less commonly, E and F are capable of intoxicating humans, causing botulism. In humans, botulism causes flaccid paralysis, which can result in life-threatening conditions due to asphyxiation of the diaphragm. There are a few hundred annual cases of botulism in the United States, mainly stemming from improper food preparation or wound infections by @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$.	1
It is clear that genome analyses will provide essential information for unravelling the genetics, epidemiology and evolution of Leishmania species, just as they have revolutionised the study of Plasmodium falciparum (causative agent of @di$ cerebral malaria @/di$), methicillin-resistant @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$  and other pathogenic microorganisms.	0
It is commonly associated with foodborne illnesses and it is responsible for many instances of abscesses, septicemia, arthritis, and @di$ endocarditis @/di$. Therefore, extensive research has been undertaken to understand the factors that affect the life cycle and virulence of S. aureus. Listeria monocytogenes is likewise a Gram-positive pathogen associated with foodborne illnesses (Listeriosis), whereas @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ is a Gram-negative bacterium associated with food spoilage.	0
It is commonly associated with hematological conditions such as leukemia and @di$ lymphoma @/di$; thromboembolic disorders such as infective endocarditis; and rarely with intra-abdominal infections. In a study, cardioembolic events were the leading cause of splenic infarcts in 89 subjects. Other less commonly known etiologies include autoimmune and vascular diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa; embolic events secondary to atrial fibrillation; sickle cell disease and trait; systemic infections; and trauma. These disorders compromise the segmental vascular supply of the spleen, resulting in wedge-shaped infarcts. Enteric fever, especially due to @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi @/gm$, is an atypical cause of splenic infarction or thrombosis of the splenic vein.	1
It is known that gut microbiome has an important role in @di$ carcinogenesis @/di$ of CRC, showing initial inflammation and modulation of different signalling pathways. Each part of the colon and rectum is characterized by different strains of bacteria. The most important and studied strains were Fusobcterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Gut microbiome also varies geographically, seven strains are the most important for @di$ carcinogenesis @/di$, B. fragilis, four oral as F. nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Prevotella intermedia, @gm$ Alistipes finegoldii @/gm$ and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans.	1
It is labelled as the second most common cause of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ in hospitalized patients. Nowadays, UTI is considered a serious global public health menace, and the annual incidence amounts to almost 150 million, resulting in healthcare costs of 6 billion US $. Gram-negative bacteria have been implicated as the prominent and putative causative agents of UTI, including the members of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp. and non-fermenting organisms, particularly @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$.	1
It is present on the skin, in the oral cavity, and the intestinal mucosa where it is known to be the causative agent of a wide range of diseases and opportunistic infections, including alveolar abscesses, maxillary sinusitis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, noma, pericarditis, sepsis, hepatitis, @di$ granuloma @/di$, acne, and orbital abscesses. S. mitis, which was detected in 7 patients (Figure 3(b)), is an indigenous oral bacterium that is primarily present in the buccal mucosa and on tooth surfaces. It is a potential causative agent of endocarditis. P. denticola, which was detected in 6 patients (Figure 3(b)), is an indigenous oral bacterium and commonly detected in subgingival biofilm of periodontitis patients, F. nucleatum, which was detected in 6 patients (Figure 3(b)), is associated with periodontitis, and according to Kuriyama et al. it is often present in an abscess along with the anginosus group of Streptococci. Other bacterial species were detected, including E. faecalis, S. capitis, P. gingivalis, S. haemolyticus, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, S.	1
"It is well known that the butyrate produced by @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ is a prebiotic. Researchers have attempted to directly or indirectly administer butyrate or butyrate ""carriers"" such as tributyrin. For effective absorption, rectal butyrate enema had been previously introduced in UC treatment. Similarly, our research group revealed the therapeutic effect of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ by suspension gavage in mice. In this view, we strongly suggest a need to develop viable probiotics based on @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ in medicine. Whole-grain diets with abundant fiber can also be fermented using @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$. Of note is that other special prebiotic supplements, such as acetate, xylan, beta-mannans, and protein hREG3alpha, alter the abundance of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ and butyrate production and promote niche superiority. As such, the application of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ can benefit from advancement in the development of materials. Recently, in our laboratory, we developed a magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (MION) internalized @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$, and the magnetic field can be directed both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, a careful investigation of the viability and cytotoxicity of MION internalized @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ and a custom-made magnetic guide facility were conducted in vitro. The results demonstrated good orienteering and the anti-inflammatory effect of MIONs in the TNBS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mouse model."	2
It may also protect against colorectal cancer and @di$ colitis @/di$. The importance of butyrate in the gut was demonstrated in an analysis of stool samples from six overweight men on strictly controlled diets. More than 320 phylotypes were detected, and 25 % of cultured species accounted for approximately 50 % of the 16S ribosomal RNA sequences. Approximately 30 % of the dominant bacterial species could produce butyrate; these were F. prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium hallii, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, Roseburia faecis, Subdoligranulum variabile, Roseburia inulinivorans and two new species.	2
It remains to be seen what significance these radiologic findings hold for the diagnosis and treatment of the @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ or the other entities listed above, but clearly more research is needed in order to understand the utility of this radiologic abnormality in diagnosing and prognosticating @di$ encephalopathy @/di$.	0
It was also positively associated with both potential pathogens and symbionts such as multiple Clostridium species and @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$, a potentially therapeutic bacterium for @di$ metabolic disorders @/di$.	2
It was previously shown that Blautia wexlerae could contribute to the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis, and its depletion was associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ and metabolic complications. The study conducted by Mondot et al. found that the increase of Dorea longicatena was beneficial to maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease. These results suggested that the decrease in gut microflora which produced SCFAs may be responsible for the poor outcome of HTGAP patients. Some Bacteroides species within the family Bacteroidaceae, including @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, and Bacteroides uniformis, were essential species to induce the production of gut IgA, which acted as a protective factor for maintaining the stability of the intestinal environment by limiting the bacteria and endotoxin invasive intestinal epithelial cells, facilitating bacterial clearance, and regulating bacterial colonization.	2
It was proved that severe patients with alcoholic hepatitis had high levels of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$, which decreased after rifaximin treatment. Wei et al found that @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ was the most strongly disease-associated taxa, which was positively correlated with the serum level of aspartate aminotransferase and liver inflammation in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Several studies confirmed that the abundance of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ increases in patients with cirrhosis. In the current study, we also found that the relative abundance of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ increased in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is consistent with the foregoing conclusion. However, when complicated by @di$ HE @/di$, the relative abundance of @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ decreased.	1
It was subsequently also discovered that butyrate, and @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$-derived pentanoate, improved the anti-tumor reactivity of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by increasing their production of effector cytokines IFNgamma and TNF-alpha through HDAC inhibition. Additionally, studies showed that increased SCFAs from high-fiber feeding in mice encouraged CD8+ T cell activation and later transition into memory cells in context of @di$ viral infections @/di$.	2
Klebsiella is a genus of diverse bacterial pathogens that originate in the gut flora and is a common cause of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, septicemia, and @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$. Up to now, many species and subspecies of the genus Klebsiella have been identified and consist of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Klebsiella granulomatis, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella variicola, and so on.	1
Klebsiella oxytoca is actually a complex of nine species-Klebsiella grimontii, Klebsiella huaxiensis, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, K. oxytoca, Klebsiella pasteurii, Klebsiella spallanzanii, and three unnamed novel species. Phenotypic tests can assign isolates to the complex, but precise species identification requires genome-based analysis. The K. oxytoca complex is a human commensal but also an opportunistic pathogen causing various infections, such as antibiotic-associated @di$ hemorrhagic colitis @/di$ (AAHC), urinary tract infection, and bacteremia, and has caused outbreaks.	1

Knowing that the isolation of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ in blood is considered as an unusual medical event, a case of an infant deceased from @di$ septicemia @/di$ by @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ is presented here.	1
Kulasekara and colleagues conducted a genomic analysis of 100 different EHEC isolates, and found that the presence of a functional NO  reductase (NorV) correlated with an increased incidence of @di$ HUS @/di$. EHEC strains possessing a functional NorV enzyme were associated with @di$ HUS @/di$ incidences of up to 25%, whereas those with the inactive form of the enzyme (possessing a 204 nt in-frame deletion in the norV gene) exhibited fewer cases (up to a 10-fold reduction) of @di$ HUS @/di$. Recent outbreaks have supported this association, such as the German outbreak in 2011, where the causative @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ strain possessed a functional NorV.	1
"L2_50, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium hallii, Eubacterium ramulus, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Peptostreptococcaceae noname unclassified, Prevotella copri, Ruminococcus callidus, @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$, Ruminococcus obeum, and Sutterella wadsworthensis. In this list, at least one bacterium regarded as ""unfriendly"" can be found: O. splanchnicus, which has been isolated from the crevicular spaces of dogs with @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (Hardham et al.,)."	0
LEfSe analysis revealed that Aeromonas, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Shewanella, Chryseomicrobium, Exiguobacterium, Vibrio and Flavobacterium, and Kurtzmaniella were the microbial biomarkers in hemolymph of @di$ WMS @/di$ (Fig. 2b). Welch's t test results also showed that the relative abundances of these bacterial and fungal genera in the hemolymph of @di$ WMS @/di$ crabs were significant higher (P < 0.05 in all cases) than those of healthy crabs (Additional file 2: Figure S2c). Together, Aeromonas, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Shewanella, Chryseomicrobium, Exiguobacterium, Vibrio and Flavobacterium, and Kurtzmaniella of hemolymph could act as the indicators for @di$ WMS @/di$.	1
LEfSe analysis was further conducted to confirm the significant differences in fecal microbiota compositions at the family, genus and species levels between the @di$ AKI @/di$ and Non_@di$ AKI @/di$ groups, which are displayed in Figure 4. Compared to the Non_@di$ AKI @/di$ group, the increased abundance of bacteria in the @di$ AKI @/di$ group at the family level was enriched in Streptococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Actinomycetaceae, whereas the decreased bacterial abundance was enriched in Erysipelotrichaceae (Figure 4A). At the genus level, the abundances of Streptococcus, Escherichia, Pseudoflavonifractor, Rothia, Granulicatella, Peptostreptococcus, and Actinomyces were significantly increased in the @di$ AKI @/di$ group, while those of Gemmiger, Erysipelatoclostridium, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, and Ruminococcus were decreased (Figure 4B). More specifically, the species of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus gallinarum, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Clostridium innocuum were found to be significantly more enriched in the @di$ AKI @/di$ group, whereas Non_@di$ AKI @/di$ patients exhibited greater abundance of Prevotella sp. CAG: 1031, Coprococcus comes, Oscillibacter sp. 57_20, and Lactobacillus fermentum (Figure 4C). Overall, LEfSe revealed significant differences between the two groups: in particular, Figures 4D,E show that the class Bacilli, genus Escherichia, species Escherichia coil, and genus Streptococcus were more enriched in the @di$ AKI @/di$ group, while the genera Ruminococcus, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, Prevotella sp. CAG: 1031, and Erysipelatoclostridium were much more enriched in the Non_@di$ AKI @/di$ group.	2

LTBI and HC individuals had no TB-related symptoms and negative sputum acid-fast bacilli smear for @gm$ MTB @/gm$. None of the participants was reported to have concomitant @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$, HIV infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or HCV infection, or immune-mediated disorders.	0
Laboratory analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis, and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a @di$ liver abscess @/di$. Interventional radiology placed an 8 French drainage catheter in the @di$ hepatic abscess @/di$ and drained 40cc of purulent fluid. A culture of the abscess fluid revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Bacteroides fragilis, and @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$.	1
Labs were significant for @di$ leukocytosis @/di$, transaminitis, and coagulopathy. Imaging showed liver cirrhosis with ascites and a left pleural effusion. Treatment of the effusion consisted of chest tube drainage and antibiotics. Spontaneous bacterial empyema was diagnosed after pleural fluid cultures were positive for @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$.	1
Labyrinthitis in humans has been reportedconcurrently with infection due to various viruses (for example, varicella-zoster, measles, mumps) and bacteria (for example,@gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and may be associated with vertebrobasilar ischemia and @di$ meningitis @/di$.	1
Lactic acid bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus ruminis, Weissella confusa, and Weissella cibaria) were positively correlated with metadata associated with IR, increased @di$ abdominal circumference @/di$, dyslipidemia, and inflammation (CRP levels). In contrast, Lactobacillus malefermentans showed a negative correlation with TG and positive correlation with HDL levels. @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ was positively correlated with increased @di$ abdominal circumference @/di$, dyslipidemia (TG levels), IR, and inflammation (CRP), and it also showed a negative correlation with LDL and HDL levels. Furthermore, microbial communities belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum (i.e., Schaalia meyeri, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum) showed a negative correlation with increased @di$ abdominal circumference @/di$, IR (FBG levels), and dyslipidemia risk factors.	1
Lactobacillus has not been found to be abundant in the oral cavity of otherwise healthy @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients or controls, but is generally considered to have a beneficial role in periodontal diseases by suppressing the growth of @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ by its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This might explain the low abundances of species from the red and orange complexes in samples rich in Lactobacillus species. However, a recent study found that @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ was highly abundant in @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients and especially in progressing @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients but not in healthy controls. If confirmed, these findings suggest different properties of Lactobacillus species or even clones of the same species and do not exclude that lactobacilli are involved in @di$ periodontitis @/di$ development in specific patients like liver cirrhosis patients when other more common @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ are suppressed.	1
Lactobacillus ruminis induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 by gut epithelial cells and is also involved in the elevation of IL-6 in the serum of @di$ stroke @/di$ patients. An anaerobic gram-positive gut bacteria Ruminococcus gnavus is involved in the secretion of glucorhamnan polysaccharide with an L-rhamnose oligosaccharide backbone and glucose sidechains which drives the activation of TNFalpha in dendritic cells. Butyrivibrio is a commensal bacteria involved in the production of butyrate through fermentation of pyruvate. Butyrate induces the secretion of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 from regulatory T cells (Treg). It also inhibits the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the gut by inducing secretion of IgA by plasma cells. The abundance of Butyricimonas is associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TGFbeta1 in the ileum. @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ has genes that encode butyric acid kinase and phosphate butyryltransferase enzymes.	0
Legionella sp responsible for documented nosocomial disease include Legionella pneumophila, Tatlockia micdadei, @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$, Legionella dumoffi and Legionella oakridgensis. The clinical presentation is nonspecific although diarrhea occurs frequently. @di$ Hyponatremia @/di$ occurs significantly more frequently in legionnaires' disease than pneumonias caused by other agents.	0
Legionnaire disease (LD) is characterized by a clinical picture of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and is usually accompanied by multisystem involvement. Neurologic manifestations tend to appear concurrently with, or soon after the onset of fever. Cases in which neurologic manifestations precede the development of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ are exceedingly rare. We recently treated 3 patients with LD who presented with a clinical picture of severe viral encephalitis without @di$ pneumonia @/di$. There were high serum titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against several Legionella species. However, a positive reaction in the spinal fluid was detected only against @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$.	1
Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe @di$ pneumonia @/di$ caused by Gram-negative bacteria, @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ spp., which are found in freshwater environments worldwide and tend to contaminate man-made water systems.	1
Legionnaires' disease is a severe @di$ pneumonia @/di$ caused by the bacterium @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$. Outbreaks of Legionnaire's disease have occurred in hotels, hospitals, and homes but had not been reported yet in the work environment. The authors report the occurrence of Legionnaires' disease in three employees of two industrial plants. The potable water in the two plants contained high numbers of @gm$ Legionella pneumophila @/gm$. Monoclonal antibody subtyping of environmental and patient isolates of @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ implicated one of the plants as the source for the disease. @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ was eradicated from this plant using acidic and caustic scale removers, calcium hypochlorite, and a biocide.	1
Lignans, for instance, are present in foods such as flaxseeds, vegetables and fruits and its bioconversion by bacteria renders them possible to be digested and absorbed by the human organism, where they were shown to have a protective effect against @di$ cancer @/di$ and other diseases. The conversion of lignans into secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and the subsequent production of enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL), which are responsible for the beneficial effects of lignans, involves a very complex series of steps. Eleven bacterial strains were identified to be responsible for these series of processes including several species from the genus Clostridium and Bacteroides and individual species such as Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus and Eggerthella lenta. Isoflavones can be obtained from soy-based foods and are then metabolized in the gut by certain bacterial strains such as @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, Enterorhabdus mucosicola and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. Also, the resulting metabolite from this interaction (O-desmethylangolensin) has been suggested to bear a protective role in a variety of diseases including @di$ cancer @/di$, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.	2
Like @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$, P. putida can cause, especially in immune-compromised adult patients, various types of serious infections, such as @di$ bacteremia @/di$, pneumonia or peritonitis, meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis, or more localized infections, such as sinus or urinary tract infections.	1
Likewise, administration of desipramine was also shown to cause important side effects and results in a higher incidence of infections generating @di$ gingivitis @/di$ and dysbiosis of oral microbiota. Other representatives of the tricyclic antidepressants group were previously shown to possess an in vitro antimicrobial effect toward human pathogenic species, such as amitriptyline against Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp., and @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$; and imipramine, which inhibited the growth of E.	0
Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that the relative abundance was significantly different between patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and controls in several microbes at the species level (level 7 = L7) (Fig. 2a). Six species including Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus), Veillonella ratti (V. ratti), and Intestinibacter bartlettii (I. bartlettii) were enriched in patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and 17 species including Megamonas funiformis (M. funiformis), CZBV_s, and @gm$ Roseburia inulinivorans @/gm$ (@gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$) were sparse in those patients (Fig. 2a). Heatmap of the relative abundance of these species clearly showed the distinct distribution between patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and controls. As for 17 species which are sparse in patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and enriched in controls, an average z-score was -0.252 for patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and 0.453 for controls. As for 6 species which are enriched in patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and sparse in controls, an average z-score was 0.252 for patients with @di$ MMD @/di$ and -0.453 for controls.	2
Listeriosis can lead to potentially lethal pulmonary complications in newborns and immune compromised patients, characterized by extensive permeability @di$ edema @/di$. Listeriolysin (LLO), the main virulence factor of @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, induces a dose-dependent hyperpermeability in monolayers of human lung microvascular endothelial cells in vitro.	1
Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a higher level of gut dysbiosis than @di$ alcoholism @/di$. Massive depletion of major commensals from the Bacteroidales order is accompanied by a rise of taxa normally inhabiting the oral cavity, as identified during our analysis of relative abundances of respective genomes. This effect is likely linked to the abnormal bile secretion and composition and is in agreement with the results of an earlier study describing gut metagenome in nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis patients, thus confirming this hallmark of the liver dysfunction on another cohort. The presence of oral species Lactobacillus salivarius, Veillonella parvula, and @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$ is more pronounced in ALC patients in comparison with both healthy controls as well as the @di$ ADS @/di$ group. Interestingly, we found that Bifidobacterium abundance was significantly associated with the cirrhosis. This observation might appear somewhat contradictory to a well-known enrichment of species exhibiting probiotic properties within this genus. While one cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of these taxa, along with the @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ and Lactobacillus, could be transient food-associated microbes, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that levels of Bifidobacterium can increase in pathologies like alcoholic hepatitis and inflammatory bowel diseases.	1
Liver cirrhosis was most common underlying disease (58%), followed by @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ (28%) and solid cancer (26%). There were 126 (82%) patients with fever, 107 (69%) patients with thrombocytopenia, and only 40 (26%) patients with leukocytosis. Of the 87 (56%) patients with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ bacteremia, one presented with acute cholangitis, one with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, two with traumatic wound infections, two with urosepsis, four with necrotizing fasciitis, and the others with primary bacteremia. Of the 45 (29%) patients with A. veronii biovar sobria bacteremia, one presented with urosepsis, one with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, one with necrotizing fasciitis, one with meningitis and the others with primary bacteremia. Of the 22 (14%) patients with A. caviae bacteremia, one patient presented with acute cholecystitis, one with traumatic wound infection, one with lung abscess and the others with primary bacteremia. There were 55 patients who died during hospitalization. Three patients with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ bacteremia and one patient with A.	1
Loss of Opp and App also results in increased virulence in a hamster model of @di$ infection @/di$. The data suggest that Opp and App indirectly repress sporulation through importation of small peptides, but the specific cargo that they transport has not been verified. OppA resembles a nickel-uptake receptor, while AppA is structurally similar to the oligopeptide-binding protein CtaP (cysteine transport-associated protein) from @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, which binds a restricted set of peptides, suggesting that C.	1
Low levels of Hamp in response to ineffective erythropoiesis, as observed in Ank1Ity16/Ity16 mutant mice, clearly exacerbate extramedullary erythropoiesis, tissue iron deposition and @di$ splenomegaly @/di$. During infection, liver Hamp expression levels remain suppressed and Gdf15, Il1 and Il6 expression increased significantly in Ank1Ity16/Ity16 mutant mice compared to wild type littermates. Gdf15 has been shown to be highly expressed in macrophages stimulated with LPS and to be modulated by several cytokines including IL-1 and by intracellular iron depletion in vitro. The high Gdf15 expression observed during infection in Ank1Ity16/Ity16 mutant mice could be explained by the progression of anemia and expansion of the erythroid compartment, by the high expression of cytokines induced by infection with @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ or as a consequence of intracellular iron deprivation due to low levels of Hamp expression.	1
Lungs exhibited @di$ vascular congestion @/di$, edema, and focal points of hematic extravasation in the alveoli, along with an important infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells. This inflammatory reaction was markedly abolished in mice preinfected with @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ WT (WT/LPS) as only mild @di$ vascular congestion @/di$ and edema were observed (Figure 3A, middle panel). As shown in Figure 3B, the inflammatory score found in lungs from the WT/LPS group was significantly lower than that found in the PBS/LPS group. These results show that @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ modulates the pulmonary innate immune response to a TLR4 agonist.	2
MASP1 polymorphisms were associated with @di$ 3MC syndrome @/di$ and to @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ colonization in cystic fibrosis patients.	0
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$, and Fusobacterium necleatum bacteria were chosen, as they are the most common and prevailing strains found in @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Bacterial samples were retrieved from necrotic root canals of systemically healthy and diabetic patients, before and after endodontic cleaning and shaping by using two different irrigation techniques; the conventional one and the EndoVac system. Quantitive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilised to detect the reduction in the bacterial count. RESULTS: The EndoVac irrigation system was effective in reducing bacteria, especially @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$ in the diabetic group when compared to conventional irrigation technique with a statistically significant difference.	1
MDR was defined for the most common pathogens of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ from our data. We followed definitions proposed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for defining MDR of S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$ (@gm$ E. aerogenes @/gm$).	1
MDV during the proliferative phase at 28-35 days of its life cycle, reduces the Firmicutes population and provides a favorable environment for the four different opportunistic pathogenic @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. and Proteobacteria colonization due to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Blautia is a Gram-positive staining coccoid or oval-shaped, non-motile bacterium that produces metabolites such as succinate and lactate by the degradation of polysaccharides and provides energy to the host. In recent studies, an increased Faecalibacterium spp. and Blautia spp. colonization in control chicks was reported as compared to their MDV infected counterparts, having more Streptococcus spp., and these are opportunistic pathogens that develop septicemia, @di$ peritonitis @/di$, and endocarditis in chicken.	1
METHODS: For characterisation of an arthritogenic @gm$ Eubacterium aerofaciens @/gm$ cell wall, peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) polymers were isolated by removing cell wall associated proteins (CWPs), PG and PS moieties were separated, and an attempt was made to de-O-acetylate PG-PS. The cell wall of E limosum was used as a non-arthritogenic control. The chemical composition of these cell wall preparations was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, their ability to resist lysozyme degradation and to sustain experimental @di$ chronic arthritis @/di$ was tested. RESULTS: The observations made with the cell wall of @gm$ E aerofaciens @/gm$, an anaerobic habitant of the human intestine, were compared with those reported from a pathogenic Streptococcus, showing that in both strains a complex consisting of PG-PS is required for the induction of @di$ chronic arthritis @/di$. The PS moiety most probably protects PG from enzyme degradation, allowing prolonged tissue persistence and leading to the chronic synovial inflammation. CWPs attached to PG-PS are not necessary for this function. O-Acetylation of PG, which is required for arthritogenicity of the streptococcal cell wall, seems not to be present in the arthritogenic @gm$ E aerofaciens @/gm$ PG or only occurs to a small degree; attempts to de-O-acylate the @gm$ E aerofaciens @/gm$ cell wall did not affect its arthritogenicity or lysozyme resistance. CONCLUSION: The results obtained indicate that the source of bacterial cell wall plays no part in the chemical or structural requirements for PG to induce chronic cell wall @di$ arthritis @/di$ in the rats; the chemical structure of the PG moiety is decisive.	1
METHODS: Full-mouth @di$ periodontal @/di$ clinical assessments were carried out in 76 obese women (17 periodontally healthy and 59 with periodontal disease), and 34 non-obese women (12 periodontally healthy, 22 with periodontal disease). Subgingival biofilm samples were individually obtained from seven sites of each individual, and the prevalence and counts of 40 bacterial taxa were determined by the checkerboard method. The frequency and counts of each species were computed for each individual and across the groups. Differences among and between groups were sought by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. Possible correlations between obesity and clinical and microbiologic parameters were tested with Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were found in significantly higher levels in obese compared with non-obese women (P < 0.01). In patients with @di$ periodontal health @/di$, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected in higher mean frequency and/or counts in obese women than in non-obese women, whereas in patients with periodontal disease, obese women harbored greater levels of C. ochracea than non-obese women (P < 0.01). Moreover, obese women with periodontal disease presented significantly greater mean counts of P. gingivalis and @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ than non-obese women with @di$ periodontal health @/di$ (P < 0.01). When the conditions obesity and periodontal disease are present at the same time, significant positive correlations were detected with C. ocharcea, P. gingivalis, S. sanguinis, and @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$. CONCLUSION: Few differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of obese and non-obese women with @di$ periodontal health @/di$ or disease were found. However, a high prevalence of P. gingivalis in obese women with @di$ periodontal health @/di$ was observed.	1
METHODS: In a double blind prospective study, 65 children aged 6-12 months were randomized to receive 6 x 10(9) colony forming units of @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) of each strain), 10 mg of zinc/day, and 0.3 grams of fructo-oligosaccharides in the supplemented group (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32), given in a soy protein based rice cereal. For each child, age, sex, weight, degree of @di$ dehydration @/di$, the presence of fever or vomiting, stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily until diarrhea resolution. RESULTS: Diarrhea resolution occurred after 1.43 +/- 0.71 days in the supplemented group vs. 1.96 +/- 1.24 in the control group (p = 0.017). In the subset of children who presented with vomiting, time to vomiting resolution was 0.27 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.91 days in the supplemented and control groups, respectively (p = 0.06). On day 3, there was only 1 child with watery stools in the supplemented group versus 10 children in the control group (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the feeding of a cereal containing @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc, reduced the severity and duration of acute gastroenteritis in young children.	2
METHODS: Subgingival biofilm was obtained from individuals with periodontal health (PH) (n = 139), @di$ gingivitis @/di$ (n = 103), and periodontitis (n = 305) and cultivated on selective media. Isolated strains were identified by mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial sensitivity was determined by disk diffusion, virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction, and the subgingival microbiota by checkerboard. Differences among groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Enterococcus spp. were isolated from 7.4% of all samples; 53.7% were @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$. They were more prevalent in periodontitis (9.8%) and @di$ gingivitis @/di$ (7.8%) than PH (2.2%; P <0.05), but no differences among stages of disease severity were observed. High rates of low susceptibility/resistance (>64%) to at least one antimicrobial were observed. Predominant virulence factors included ace (64.3%), asa (39.3%), and esp (35.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of enterococci+ individuals, whereas Dialister pneumosintes was found in low frequency in patients with bopD+ enterococci. Oral streptococci were prevalent (>70%) in patients carrying enterococci susceptible to doxycycline (P <0.05), usually bopD- and esp- (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ is increased in periodontitis-associated biofilm.	1
METHODS: These analyses utilized data from the Preventing @di$ Vaginal Infections @/di$ trial. Relative abundance of vaginal bacteria from 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene amplicon sequencing and quantities of 10 vaginal bacteria using taxon-directed polymerase chain reaction assays were compared at visits with and without detection of yeast on microscopy, culture, or both. RESULTS: Higher relative abundances of Megasphaera species type 1 (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.95), Megasphaera species type 2 (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98), and @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$ (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83) were associated with lower risk of detecting yeast.	2
METHODS: To address the discriminatory signatures, we performed shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenome across a discovery cohort (n = 97) and an independent validation cohort (n = 75) including TAK patients, healthy controls, and controls with @di$ Behcet's disease @/di$ (@di$ BD @/di$). Interrogation of untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics profiling of plasma and fecal samples were also used to refine features mediating associations between microorganisms and TAK phenotypes. RESULTS: A combined model of bacterial species, including unclassified Escherichia, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus parasanguinis, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7 1 58FAA, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus salivarius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lachnospiraceae Bacterium 5 1 63FAA, distinguished TAK patients from controls with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 87.8%, 85.9%, 81.1%, and 71.1% in training, test, and validation sets including healthy or @di$ BD @/di$ controls, respectively.	0
MIH occurs as a complication of @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ sepsis and is frequently associated with severe anemia, acute renal failure, and DIC. MIH has classically been reported in cases of post-abortion and postpartum infections, and gas gangrene.         Improvement in medical care has decreased the incidence of these entities.     However, new and more aggressive treatment of patients with malignant diseases has increased the occurrence of serious infections, including clostridial sepsis.   Currently, MIH develops in patients with diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, and malignant neoplasms, especially those with colon cancers and hematological malignancies.             Impaired mucosal barrier of the intestine by malignant neoplasms and the toxic effect of chemotherapy tend to facilitate bacterial translocation and easy access to the bloodstream. Also, non-neoplastic diseases affecting the mucosa of the digestive system, such as pan-enteritis and intestinal arteriovenous malformation (vascular ectasia), can cause @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$-induced MIH.   In this context, surgical or interventional procedures on the hepatobiliary and/or gastrointestinal system:such as cholecystectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and transhepatic arterial chemoembolization:also may be responsible for @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$-induced MIH.       Infrequently, the disease entity is reported to be caused by other conditions, such as emphysematous cystitis, @di$ endocarditis @/di$, degenerating uterine leiomyoma, and amniocentesis-related intrauterine infection.     In some MIH cases, the potential source for @gm$ C. perfringens @/gm$ sepsis remained unclear at autopsy.	1
Management of CDI in patients with @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$ (@di$ IBD @/di$) can be particularly challenging. This is due to lower response to the usual antibiotics, propensity to develop severe/severe-complicated disease and an increased risk of recurrences. CDI in these patients often lacks the typical risk factors such as antibiotic use, affects younger patients and is frequently community-acquired. Occurrence of CDI increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as @di$ IBD @/di$ flares, intensification of therapy for @di$ IBD @/di$, colectomy and death. Due to the considerable overlap between clinical features of CDI and @di$ IBD @/di$, all patients with a suspected @di$ IBD @/di$ flare should be tested for @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$.	1
Manifestations include skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), ocular infections such as keratitis and conjunctivitis, @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$, gastrointestinal infections, pneumonia, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and disseminated infections. Bacterial species implicated in water-associated illness include Aeromonas hydrophila, Chromobacterium violaceum, Edwardisella tarda, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Leptospira, Mycobacterium spp, Shewanella spp, and Vibrio spp, as well as Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp.	1
Many microbiota, such as @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria, are involved in the degradation of oxalic acid. According to our previous research, substance use disorders (including @di$ heroin abuse @/di$) can significantly change the gut microbiota.	0
Many of the Coriobacteriia, particularly @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$ and Paraeggerthella, are considered to be opportunistic pathogens because of their isolation from @di$ bacteremia @/di$ patients.	1
Many other studies of hematological changes during the active course of brucellosis showed that leukopenia occurred in 33% of patients, anemia in 44%, thrombocytopenia in 5% and @di$ pancytopenia @/di$ in 14%. Furthermore, Mantur BG et al detected @di$ pancytopenia @/di$ in 10% of children suffering brucellosis. The relative frequency of @di$ pancytopenia @/di$ with brucellosis varies from 2% to 14% in previous studies, being relatively higher in adults than in children. The possible mechanisms suggested for @di$ pancytopenia @/di$ include hypersplenism, granuloma formation in the BM, phagocytosis of formed elements by reticuloendothelial cells or BM depression due to associated septicemia. Although anemia in brucellosis is expected to be due to BM involvement, numerous other pathogenetic mechanisms can be (and have been) implicated. Bourantas et al reported that brucellosis induced an autoimmune process, culminating in autoimmune hemolysis. In this study, blood culture was positive for brucellosis in 23 children (21 for @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ and 2 for B.	1
Many studies have investigated the human vaginal microbiome during pregnancy, and its implications in @di$ PTB @/di$. Generally, @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. are regarded as beneficial, and are associated with term deliveries. In contrast, patients with CST IV (polymicrobial, BV) vaginal microbiota are more likely to experience @di$ PTB @/di$ than patients with vaginal microbiota dominated by @gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$. It is hypothesized that BV leads to decreased barrier function of CVM, allowing the ascension of bacteria or other inflammatory stimuli from the vaginal environment into the uterine compartment. Clinically, patients with BV often report an excess of thin, watery discharge. Indeed, others measured a decrease in mucus viscosity associated with BV using macrorheology. Here, we demonstrated that, regardless of timing of pregnancy, CST IV samples showed decreased barrier properties as compared to CST I samples. We previously observed that CST III samples show decreased barrier properties. Clinically, women with CST III vaginal microbiota are also at an increased risk for @di$ PTB @/di$.	1
Marine seaweeds are recognized as a promising source of anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ therapeutics. Bioactive extracts, including alginates, fucoidans, and fucoxanthin, have been extensively studied for their anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ activity. Supplement of seaweed-extracted polysaccharides promoted the enhancement of beneficial bacteria including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, or @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$. Algo (degree of polymerization 1-4), fucoidans (from L. japonica and Ascophyllum nodosum), and fucoxanthin (from Undaria pinnatifida) have been reported to ameliorate HFD-induced metabolic syndromes, and this phenomenon was supposed to be associated with the increased abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$. @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$, a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to Verrucomicrobia, has shown the potential as an emerging probiotic. Decreased abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ has been observed in mice affected by @di$ obesity @/di$ or type 2 diabetes in a previous study, and oral @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ supplementation has been demonstrated to restore the thickness of mucus, enhance the gut barrier function, and reverse HFD-induced metabolic disorders. Amuc_1100, the nowadays isolated outer membrane of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$, helps to explain the potential mechanism of the capacity of improving the gut barrier. In this work, both the high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA in the feces and single @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ strain culture indicates that SJP contain considerable amounts of monosaccharides, including glucose, mannuronic acid, guluronic acid, and fucose, which may be utilized for the growth of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$, and can be potentially used as therapeutic agents for HFD-induced @di$ obesity @/di$. However, the relationship between the anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effect of seaweed-extracted polysaccharides and the variation of @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ has not been revealed clearly, and mechanism researches are further needed.	2
Matsumoto and Benno found that metabolites released in the stools of patients fed with yoghurt containing @gm$ Bifidobacterium animalis @/gm$ LKM512 were able to reverse the inflammation caused by LPS in J774 cells. The effect of probiotic bacteria on antigens presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells is strain-dependent, since they also may be able to upregulate the production of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. IL17 induces neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. However, its role in inducing @di$ colitis @/di$ remains uncertain, as it even presents a protective activity in the gut, depending on the model studied. The main source of this cytokine is Th17 cells; however, the innate immunity cells, including macrophages, can produce it. Here, we observe that Lp62 modulated IL-17 secretion in J774 macrophages. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of this probiotic on IL-17 production in the in vivo @di$ colitis @/di$ model.	2
McNally et al screened 100 acute and convalescent serum samples from patients with @di$ pneumonia @/di$ of unknown cause. @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$ was identified as the potential cause in 8% of cases using the criterion of fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent samples. It is possible that other @gm$ Legionella @/gm$  or @gm$ Legionella @/gm$-like organisms requiring different growth medium will be identified.	1
Meanwhile, the post-mortem signs were dark brown liver, distended gall bladder, @di$ splenomegaly @/di$, and empty intestinal tract. Similarly, @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ infections resulted in exophthalmia, hemorrhage, ulceration, fin rot, lethargy, loss of scale, skin discoloration, and hemorrhagic/necrotized internal organs in different types of fish.	1
Mechanical transmission by stomoxes has been demonstrated for Pasteurella multocida (Hemorrhagic Septicemia in Buffalo), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (an agent of erysipelas in animals and erysipeloid in humans), and Francisella tularensis (responsible for @di$ tularemia @/di$). For other bacteria, mechanical transmission by stomoxes is only suspected: Clostridium perfringens, Pasteurella multilocida, @gm$ Brucella abortus @/gm$, Brucella suis, Brucella melitensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Leptospira spp..	0
Mechanisms by which an altered microbiota might be associated with @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$ are as yet unknown. Animal studies clearly demonstrate a causal relationship, as an animal model of SpA is abrogated in the germ-free environment. Herein, we report strain-level differences in fecal abundance of F. prausnitzii between children with ERA and healthy controls. Additionally, at the functional level, decreased genetic abundance of the butanoate pathway was observed in children with ERA. Children with ERA also had increased abundance of @gm$ B. fragilis @/gm$. Notably, adults with longstanding SpA had similar trends with respect to F. prausnitzii abundance, but opposite trends with respect to @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, with decreased abundance of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ genus seen in adult SpA patients compared to adult healthy controls.	1
Metagenomic methods amplifying 16S ribosomal RNA genes have been used to describe the microbial diversity of healthy skin and lesion stages of bovine digital dermatitis (@di$ DD @/di$) and to detect critical pathogens involved with disease pathogenesis. In this study, we characterized the microbiome and for the first time, the composition of functional genes of healthy skin (HS), active (ADD) and inactive (IDD) lesion stages using a whole-genome shotgun approach. Metagenomic sequences were annotated using MG-RAST pipeline. Six phyla were identified as the most abundant. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were the predominant bacterial phyla in the microbiome of HS, while Spirochetes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were highly abundant in ADD and IDD. T. denticola-like, @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$-like and T. phagedenis-like constituted the most abundant species in ADD and IDD. Recruitment plots comparing sequences from HS, ADD and IDD samples to the genomes of specific Treponema spp., supported the presence of T. denticola and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ in ADD and IDD. Comparison of the functional composition of HS to ADD and IDD identified a significant difference in genes associated with motility/chemotaxis and iron acquisition/metabolism. We also provide evidence that the microbiome of ADD and IDD compared to that of HS had significantly higher abundance of genes associated with resistance to copper and zinc, which are commonly used in footbaths to prevent and control @di$ DD @/di$. In conclusion, the results from this study provide new insights into the HS, ADD and IDD microbiomes, improve our understanding of the disease pathogenesis and generate unprecedented knowledge regarding the functional genetic composition of the @di$ digital dermatitis @/di$ microbiome.	1
Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ and Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to @di$ metabolic disorders @/di$ (anorexia, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, @gm$ Methanosphaera stadtmanae @/gm$ and Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (@di$ anorexia @/di$, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
Methanogenic archaea are involved in @di$ periodontitis @/di$ in humans. They have also been implicated in digestive tract pathologies and obesity. These microorganisms are broadly resistant to antibiotics, except for metronidazole and ornidazole. In this study, eight imidazole derivatives were synthesised and their in vitro cytotoxicity and activity against six species of methanogenic archaea, including Methanobrevibacter smithii, @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobacterium beijingense, Methanosaeta concilii and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, were tested.	1
Methanogens are a significant part of the human microbiota in some individuals and have been associated with diseases, including @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (Methanobrevibacter oralis), or negatively associated to others, such as obesity (@gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$). However, these microorganisms were never associated with any intestinal disease. Previous studies aimed to demonstrate a possible role of methanogens in IBD, but the potential impact of an imbalance between MSS and @gm$ MBS @/gm$ alone was never observed. Indeed, Scanlan et al. demonstrated that a lower proportion of patients were positive for methanogens in their gut compared to controls. Our results confirm that observation. Our data show that this decrease is at the expense of the usually much higher numbers of @gm$ MBS @/gm$, which tended to be decreased in IBD. Unlike the study from Scanlan et al., we were able to amplify and quantify MSS DNA from stool DNA extracts, suggesting higher sensitivity for the primers we designed. Moreover, our data suggest that PCR protocols used for @gm$ MBS @/gm$ and MSS detection are more efficient than the PCR protocol used for total methanogen quantification since some samples were positive for @gm$ MBS @/gm$ or MSS primers but negative with the total methanogen primers (table 3).	2
MiR-16 was significantly upregulated in cats with @di$ PN @/di$ compared with healthy cats (P = .01) and cats with other urological conditions (P = .04). The sample from the cat with @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$-associated @di$ PN @/di$ had a cook's distance of >1, indicative of an outlier. MiR-30a, miR-4286, and miR-204 were significantly downregulated in cats with @di$ PN @/di$ compared with healthy cats (P < .001, P = .02, and P < .001, respectively) and compared with cats with other urological conditions (P = .02, P = .02, and P = .004, respectively) (Figure 4).	1
Mice are the most commonly utilized animal, but limitations to this model include lack of @di$ fever @/di$ response, relatively high dose required to generate systemic infection, and an artificial route of inoculation that does not mimic natural transmission events. In contrast, guinea pigs develop key features of disease when inoculated via an aerosol route, which closely mimics the naturally occurring disease process. Guinea pigs were used in the early twentieth century as the model of choice to evaluate the pathogenicity of Brucella species such as B. abortus, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$, and B.	1
Mice given the microbiota from the chronically stressed mice showed higher levels of @di$ anxiety @/di$- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. Vice versa, fecal microbiota transplantation from the health donors to the stressed recipient rats ameliorated stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Based on these findings that gut dysbiosis is causally linked to the deleterious effects of stress, restoration of gut microbiota homeostasis by probiotic intervention has gained a great attention in recent years. The beneficial effects of probiotics on the chronic stress-induced behavioral disorders, cognitive impairments, neurochemical abnormalities by reshaping the disturbed gut microbe in rodents have been shown by supplementation of @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ CCFM1025, @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ M2CF22M7, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium longum CCFM687, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ATCC 27766, Lactobacillus helveticus NS8, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3, respectively.	2
Mice null in key inflammasome components succumb to @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ earlier and have higher bacterial loads illustrating the importance of this pathway in host-@gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ interactions. We have used the Hi-HOST methodology to explore inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis, in response to @gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$ and discuss some of our key findings from this screen of Hapmap cells in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5. Detection of various @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ components in the host can activate more than one inflammasome platform, i.e., NLRC4 (NOD-, LRR- and CARD-containing 4) and NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3). The role of NLRC4 in pathology of human diseases has remained unclear until very recently, when gain-of-function mutations in the NLRC4 gene that cosegregate with distinct autoinflammatory syndromes in affected families have been reported. Variants are marked by recurrent @di$ fever @/di$, notable gastrointestinal pathology, systemic elevation of the levels of inflammatory markers and spontaneous ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) aggregation in macrophages.	1
Mice were also @di$ infected @/di$ with either Staphylococcus aureus Lux Xen29 or @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ Lux Xen5 and observed at day 5 after treatment. The mice were lightly anesthetized, and the @di$ infected @/di$ wounds were visualized using an IVIS Lumina XR system with Living Image software (Perkin Elmer, US).	1
Microbial composition at D1 was compared between the three patient groups (CDI, AAD, and @di$ ND @/di$) for identification of predictive microbial markers. Patients who developed CDI harbored elevated levels of the pathobiont @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ (Fig. 3c, Table 2, and Supplementary Fig. 4). AAD patients harbored elevated levels of the family Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI, Ruminococcus (R. torques, R. faecis, R. lactaris, and Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum), and Blautia spp. (B. wexlerae, B. obeum, and B. faecis, Supplementary Tables 2-6), whereas @di$ ND @/di$ patients primarily exhibited a higher abundance of Blautia luti, Prevotella, uncultured Clostridiales, Porphyromonas (P. bennonis, P. asaccharolytica, P. uenonis), Campylobacter, and Ezakiella, in addition to members of the Bifidobacteriales family. When comparing CDI versus non-CDI (including AAD, @di$ ND @/di$, and non-CDI tested diarrheic cases) patients at D1, several OTUs showed lower abundance among CDI patients, which included six Bifidobacterium spp.	1

Microbiota-derived mediators may decrease @di$ pain @/di$ perception via peripheral and central mechanisms. For peripheral mechanisms, the mediators that reduce hypersensitivity include proteases, kynurenic acid, and GABA. Short-chain fatty acids regulate leucocyte functions, and one of these short-chain fatty acids, butyrate, reduces @di$ pain @/di$ associated with nerve injury by inhibiting histone deacetylase. Bile acids are another type of mediator, that may reduce @di$ pain @/di$ by activating release of endogenous opioids from macrophages. The bacteria that could be implicated in the production of the abovementioned mediators include Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus, Monascus purpureus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Clostridium butyricum, Coprococcus eutactus, C. comes, Bifidobacterium spp., B. dentium, B. infantis, B. adolescentis, Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium hallii, E. rectale, Anaerostripes butyraticus, A. caccae, @gm$ A. hadrus @/gm$, Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, Roseburia faecis, R. inulinivorans, R. intestinalis, R. hominis, and Escherichia spp., again supporting a potential association between gut microbiome and @di$ pain @/di$ outcomes.	2
Milk fat @di$ depression @/di$ or situations associated with greater trans-10 accumulation are often associated with increased ruminal abundance of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$, Streptococcus spp. and Selenomonas spp. (e.g.), suggesting that those bacteria are involved in the formation of trans-10 intermediates from 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3. Indeed, Kim et al. found that two strains of ruminal @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ (i.e. YJ-4 and T81) converted 18:2n-6 to trans-10, cis-12 CLA. In contrast, neither of the two @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ strains analyzed in the study of Maia et al., i.e. LC1 and T81, formed trans-10, cis-12 CLA. In the current study, fourteen different strains of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$, including LC1 and T81, were incubated with 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6. Under the experimental conditions used here, only two strains were able to metabolize 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6, i.e. 2602A and 5052B. Nevertheless, the formed intermediates were mainly hydroxy FA rather than the expected trans-10 intermediates. Those results suggest that it is unlikely that @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ directly contributes to the trans-11 to trans-10 shift.	0
Molecular evidence of St.LI's CoD from @di$ pneumonia @/di$ corroborates the skeletal evidence of systemic disease. The most abundant taxa identified, @gm$ A. junii @/gm$ and A. nosocomialis are strictly aerobic, recognized nosocomial and/or opportunistic microbes. As oral abscesses are typically comprised of strict anaerobes, the presence of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is likely associated with the active infection that potentially contributed to St.LI's recorded @di$ lobar pneumonia @/di$ CoD. The resemblance of this community to other tooth root microbial communities (Supplementary Note 1 Fig. 8) may reflect that calculus was sampled from an abscessed, first mandibular molar (Supplementary Note 1 Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 1 Fig. 19). If so, the dental calculus reflects a depreciated microbial community and the continued, unhindered development of plaque despite the presence of an abscess (see Supplementary Note 1 for calculus formation discussion); oral microbes may have freely accessed nearby host circulatory and lymphatic vessels due to concurrent local inflammatory responses (i.e., periodontal disease). The simultaneous occurrence of the exposed circulatory and lymphatic vessels of the abscessed molar, and the continued deposition and calcification of dental plaque is potentially what made the incorporation of the Klebsiella and @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ bacteria possible from the concurrent infections (see Supplementary Note 1).	1
Monascus purpureus-fermented adlay, with high contents of gamma-tocotrienol, gamma-oryzanol, and coixenolide, exhibited higher antioxidant activity and anticancer activity against human @di$ laryngeal carcinoma @/di$ cells HEp2. Lactobacillus-fermented adlay-soymilk showed anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages by suppressing the expression of NF-kappa B. Interestingly, Bacillus-fermented adlay dramatically improved the antioxidant status, lipid metabolism, and intestinal microflora in hyperlipidemic hamsters, indicating that @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$-fermented adlay could be used as a functional food for cardiovascular and intestinal health. In previous studies, we also found that @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$-fermented dehulled adlay (BDA) contained high levels of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), phenolics, flavonoids, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and triterpenoids, and exhibited strong antioxidant activity of alcoholic extract. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate whether the anti-proliferative activity of adlay is improved after fermentation by @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$.	2
More specifically, FMT markedly improved the symptoms of AS along with diarrhea and @di$ abdominal pain @/di$. As we were intrigued by the findings, we further explored how FMT exerted its therapeutic role in AS. Our findings suggest that FMT may alleviate AS via restoring the gut microbiota, mainly by enhancing the abundance of bacteria associated with short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium.	2
Moreover, @di$ AD @/di$ patients showed a strong reduction of some SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, Eubacterium and Propionibacterium. SCFAs are of particular interest for maintaining host health because they may exert anti-inflammatory effects through several mechanisms, including epithelial integrity (preserving tight junctions) and maintenance of the mucus layer. The resulting low production of SCFAs may be causative of the intestinal barrier dysfunction, increased intestinal permeability and inflammation found in ADs. In particular, @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ spp. are butyrate-producing bacteria. Interestingly, Nylund and co-workers reported an inverse correlation between the SCORAD index and the levels of @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$, confirming the role of this particular genus in the amelioration of @di$ AD @/di$.	2
Moreover, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ strains, usually found as a commensal of human oral environment, can exert a strong immunomodulatory effect and a protective effect on human cells, and can cause a variety of infectious complications including infective endocarditis, bacteriemia and @di$ septicaemia @/di$.	1
Moreover, Eubacterium dolichum and Prevotella copri had a positive correlation with the faecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 while @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium citroniae, Dialister, Haemophilus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Ruminococcus and Streptococcus anginosus showed an inverse association with the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Antibiotic-naive COVID-19 patients presented a higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens that could induce @di$ bacteremia @/di$ such as Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides nordii and C. hathewayi than healthy controls and pneumonia controls. It was thus inferred that severe COVID-19 might be the outcome of secondary bacterial infection. Several members belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, Coprobacillus, C. hathewayi and C. ramosum, showed a positive correlation with COVID-19 severity. Reportedly, Coprobacillus was able to increase ACE2 expression in murine gut. C. hathewayi and C. ramosum were revealed to be connected with human infection and @di$ bacteremia @/di$. In contrast, baseline faecal abundance of beneficial species A. onderdonkii and F. prausnitzii was inversely associated with COVID-19 severity. @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ species played a critical role in preserving intestinal immune homeostasis, while F.	2
Moreover, Michaelis Menten kinetics and very low reaction rates were also observed for the inulosucrase from @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$ CW28 (Km: 24 mM; V: 0.015 U/mg protein. @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ accessions are believed to be main players in colonizing the surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, a long-lasting but highly rewarding process. Very similar kinetics were observed for the Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 inulosucrase (Km: 17 mM; V: 1.2 U/mg protein). Both inulosucrases contain atypical N-terminal extensions that may be involved in surface binding processes. S. mutans OMZ175 not only contributes to plaque formation and caries in the oral cavity, but its dissemination into the blood stream also increases the risk of @di$ heart failure @/di$ through infection of coronary artery endothelial cells.	1
Moreover, a decrease in redness and @di$ swelling @/di$ of the gums around the implants was observed. In the genetic study, a significant reduction in the total number of bacteria was observed, as well as a significant reduction in the number of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Treponema denticola (Td), Tanerella forsythia (Tf) and @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$ (@gm$ Pm @/gm$).	2
Moreover, cluster 1 enriched the ASVs belonging to @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$. Some species of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ have been reported to produce acetate. In addition, high levels of acetate and butyrate concentration, as well as the functional genes involved in the production of these metabolites were observed in cluster 1. Studies have revealed that acetate suppresses body fat accumulation and inflammation in @di$ obese @/di$ or diabetic rodents through multiple mechanisms.	2
Moreover, polyamines produced by gut bacteria contribute to @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ prevention. Considering these findings, the regulation of gut bacterial metabolite production in the human is crucial for the maintenance of nutritional homeostasis and diseases prevention in humans. The molecular mechanism of gut bacterial metabolites production and their physiological function in the host have been gradually elucidated. For example, aromatic lactic acid produced by aromatic lactate dehydrogenase of Bifidobacterium affects the host immune system, and isoallolithocholic acid produced by 5alpha-reductase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ St3 through shows bactericidal activity against gram-positive pathogens.	2
Moreover, the lactate produced by Lactobacillus bacteria is converted into butyrate in the gut through bacteria such as @gm$ B. Coccoides @/gm$ and E. rectale, also found to be enhanced after exercise. Furthermore, butyrate is shown to be related to mucin synthesis and gut epithelium protection. In another study, Matsunomo et al. showed that exercise altered microbiota and enhanced n-butyrate concentration in rats' cecum. Therefore, enhanced Lactobacillus found in Obese rats group may possibly have a positive role in the gastrointestinal environment of these animals. It has been reported that @di$ obesity @/di$-associated gut microbiota is enriched in some species of Lactobacillus (e.g. Lactobacillus reuteri) while other species (e.g. Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17) are involved in metabolism regulation, presenting anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effects.	2
Moreover, we found the non-DKD group presented a higher increase in the species Bacteroides coprocola, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, and Bacteroides sp D22, which were classified as Bacteroidetes. Bacteroidetes is well-known for its capability to ferment dietary fiber into SCFAs, an emerging therapeutic target for systemic inflammatory, immune, and metabolic diseases, especially in glucose tolerance, @di$ obesity @/di$, and insulin resistance.	2
Mortality as a result of anaerobic @di$ bacteremia @/di$ remains high. Risk factors for a fatal outcome include compromised status of the host, advanced age, inadequate or no surgical therapy, and the presence of polymicrobial sepsis. Additionally, mortality varies between the infecting B. fragilis group species. Bacteroides fragilis is the most common anaerobic isolate in these studies, with associated mortality between 24% and 31%, while the mortality associated with @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ bacteremia ranges between 38% and 100%, and that associated with B. distasonis @di$ bacteremia @/di$ is about 50%.	1
Most human cases present with gastroenteritis, which includes acute watery or bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, @di$ vomiting @/di$, fever and dehydration. Amongst the known species of Campylobacter, Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent and frequently associated with diarrhoea or other bacteremic infections. Other species such as @gm$ C. coli @/gm$, C.	1
Most notably, among these OTUs, five Bacteroides species (Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$) were promoted by EGCG addition as compared to the blank. The genus Bacteroides is one of the dominant genera in human gut microbiota, which constitutes 20-40% of the human colonic bacteria and imparts substantial metabolic, immunologic, and defensive functions in the gastrointestinal tract. For example, infant colonic B. uniformis exhibits the ability to boost anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokine production and ameliorating metabolic and immune dysfunction. Fecal B. vulgatus was found to negatively correlate with coronary artery disease, and it was demonstrated to reduce gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production and thus exert anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties.	2
Most of the detected gram-negative bacteria are known to cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$ in humans and are not found in the safe or diseased periodontal tissue. These include Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter dissolvens, an emerging species closely related to Enterobacter cloacae , @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ and Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella variicola, a genotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae .	1
Most of the effects are categorized into: 1) control of pathogenic bacteria, 2) prevention of diarrhea, 3) alleviation of @di$ constipation @/di$, 4) stimulation of immune response, 5) prevention of cancer, 6) improvement of metabolic disorders, etc. Based on this classification, lactic acid bacteria were broadly used as probiotics. Besides lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria are also recognized as one of the beneficial bacteria for human health. Bifidobacteria play similar roles as the lactic acid bacteria in the human gut, and normally reside in colon and effectively eradicate few pathogenic bacteria, including @gm$ Escherichia coli O157:H7 @/gm$, by producing acetic acid as well as lactic acid.	2
Most of the knowledge concerning alginate biosynthesis is at present available from the soil bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a serious human pathogen for people with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ (@di$ CF @/di$).	1
Most pathogenic Staphylococcus can produce coagulase, staphylolysin, enterotoxin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin1, resulting in @di$ fever @/di$, emesis, diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis, and even shock. Moreover, Staphylococcus can invade the host through multiple ways and cause local and systemic infections as well as various invasive diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, blood poisoning, and septic pyemia. Remarkably, E. coli infection significantly increased Acinetobacter, Aerococcus, and Comamonas levels and decreased @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Megasphaera content as compared to control group. Acinetobacter, a common opportunistic pathogen, is widely colonized in the digestive tract, skin, respiratory tract, and genitourinary tract, which can cause bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, as well as urinary and skin infections. Aerococcus can result in endocarditis and urinary tract infections. Comamonas may be closely related to bacteremia. @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, a butyrate-producing bacterium, can utilize sucrose, cellobiose, galactose, and glycogen.	2
Mounting evidence has shown that patients with @di$ obesity @/di$ have a change in the composition of the gut microbiota. In @di$ obesity @/di$, the increased gut microbiome included the phylum Molluskum of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, as well as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratios; the decreased gut microbiome included Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, and Alistipes. More importantly, studies indicated that some types of microbes could be regarded as biomarkers for metabolism-related CVDs. For example, it has been reported that @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$, Dorea longicatena and Collinsella aerofaciens are associated with @di$ obesity @/di$, and Lachnospiraceae is associated with lipid cardiovascular risk factors. Besides, Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus are negatively associated with cholesterol and triglycerides and positively associated with HDL. Patients with hyperlipidemia have a lower proportion of Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus in the gut. Moreover, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was also positively associated with @di$ obesity @/di$.	1
Mounting evidence suggests that probiotic consumption during adolescence attenuates LPS-induced neuroinflammation and protects against @di$ depression @/di$-like behaviors in adulthood, which may be linked to reversal of inflammation-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby decreasing one's vulnerability to brain disorders later in life. Given the prominent roles of microbial homeostasis in adolescence, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed a decrease in Firmicutes in @di$ depressed @/di$ youths and this effect could be restored by sertraline. Accordingly, specific genera belonging to this phylum, such as Faecalibacterium, Blautia, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$, and Roseburia strongly enriched in HC or DEP-sertraline-treated adolescents, which indicated the potential sensitivity of these bacterial genera to alterations of the 5-HT levels.	2
Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA), Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB), and Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI) from HI-@di$ MEDIA @/di$  (Mumbai, India). Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2921). Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). Pseudomonas aeruginosa @gm$ ATCC (27803) @/gm$.	0
Multidrug resistant Gram-negative @di$ bacteremia @/di$ represents a therapeutic challenge clinicians have to deal with. This concern becomes more difficult when causing germs are represented by carbapenem resistant @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ or difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Few antibiotics are available against these cumbersome bacteria, although literature data are not conclusive, especially for @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$. Cefiderocol could represent a valid antibiotic choice, being a molecule with an innovative mechanism of action capable of overcoming common resistance pathways, whereas intravenous fosfomycin may be an appropriate partner either enhancing cefiderocol activity or avoiding resistance development. Here we report two patients with MDR Gram negative @di$ bacteremia @/di$ who were successfully treated with a cefiderocol/fosfomycin combination.	1
Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearly preponderates as the cause of mycobacterial @di$ cervical adenitis @/di$ in adults while other mycobacteria are the cause of most @di$ cervical adenitis @/di$ in children. The preponderance of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in @di$ cervical adenitis @/di$ in children contrasts with reports of @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$ as the most frequent causative agent in other geographic areas and may reflect either a change in causative agents or geographic differences.	1
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae and @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$, the etiological agents of tuberculosis (TB; 10 million new cases per year develop active disease), leprosy and Buruli ulcer (the third most common mycobacterium infection), respectively (see e.g. Sasaki et al.; Russell; Demangel et al.). While M. tuberculosis is human-specific, the closely related Mycobacterium bovis can infect both humans and animals and lead to TB regardless of host. Another Mycobacterium is the multihost chronic enteric pathogen Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that causes chronic diarrhea among ruminants (@di$ Johne's disease @/di$). It can be present in food products derived from cattle (Chacon et al.) and some data suggest that MAP is the causative agent of Crohn's disease in humans (see e.g. Greenstein; Uzoigwe et al.). Mycobacteria are also commonly present in water, e.g. Mycobacterium avium and @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$, and hence they can constitute a threat to both animals and humans.	1
Mycobacterium ulcerans disease, also known as Buruli ulcer (BU), is a tropical disease that can lead to devastating tissue and @di$ bone destruction @/di$. The virulence of @gm$ M ulcerans @/gm$ is mainly attributed to mycolactone, a toxin with cytotoxic and immunomodulation properties.	1
Mycobacterium-like organisms, isolates 2081/92 and 4185/92, were recovered from a lymph node of a child with chronic @di$ lymphadenitis @/di$. The growth characteristics, acid-fastness, and mycolic acids of the isolate were consistent with those for Mycobacterium species. The isolates were biochemically distinct from described Mycobacterium species, although they most closely resembled @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$.	1
Mycolactone is a toxin produced by @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ and responsible for the @di$ ulcerative skin lesions @/di$ observed in patients suffering from Buruli ulcer.	1
"NBC37.1, Prevotella oris, Treponema succinifaciens, Bacteroidales bacterium @di$ CF @/di$, Rufibacter sp. DG31D, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, and Elizabethkingia ursingii were the lowest in the ""both group"" than the ""none group"" and ""one group."" Especially, the abundance of Bifidobacterium dentium was obviously decreased in the ""both group"" compared to the ""none group,"" but there were no differences with the ""one group.""."	0
Nano-dagger coated gauze was bactericidal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with log reduction >7 for @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$ (@gm$ E. coli @/gm$) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Compared with the commercially available Ag gauze, the ZIF-L nano-dagger coated gauze was more biocompatible with a lower haemolytic activity, less cytotoxicity and improved wound healing performance. Animal studies showed that the ZIF-L coated gauze can effectively kill bacteria in a S. aureus @di$ wound infection @/di$ model in mice. This novel nano-dagger coated gauze offers an effective and safe alternative for patients to protect against @di$ wound infections @/di$.	1
Nationwide surveillance programs, such as the SCOPE Program, have provided data on nosocomial enterococcal @di$ BSIs @/di$, and the NHSN system also provides national data on various types of nosocomial infections due to enterococci. The SENTRY Program has documented occurrence rates for 49 491 enterococci isolates by site of infection (BSI, PIHP, SSSI, IAI, and UTI) and is the only surveillance system that analyzes data on a broad geographic scale that includes NA, EUR, LATAM, and the APAC region. During the study period (1997-2016), a total of 765 388 strains were processed by SENTRY Program participants (373 452 from NA, 236 911 from EUR, 77 314 from LATAM, and 77 711 from the APAC region), 6.5% of which were @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ spp.	1

Neonates were subjected to @di$ sepsis @/di$ work-up including blood culture, complete blood count and C-reactive protein. Organisms were identified by Gram staining and analyzed by the VITEK II system for bacterial bio-typing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. FINDINGS: Of the 199-neonates with suspected neonatal sepsis, 154 (77.38%) had culture-proven @di$ sepsis @/di$. Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) was higher (50.25%; 100/199) than late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS) (27.13%; 54/199). Multivariable analysis identified vaginal delivery as an independent risk factor for neonatal sepsis p = 0.005. Majority of isolated bacteria (74.39%) were gram-negative with Burkholderia cepacia (39%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (13%) being the most common pathogens of EOS and LOS. The most common gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9.1%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.1%). B. cepacia showed multidrug resistance except for cefepime. All Klebsiella species isolates (100%) and most Pantoea species (93%) were ESBL and carbapenemase positive. All Escherichia coli and @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ isolates were ESBL positive.	1
"Neurosyphilis refers to infection of the central nervous system by the spirochete @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$. Historically, neurosyphilis was often described as a form of ""tertiary syphilis,"" but it is now established that neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of infection (primary, secondary, latent, or tertiary). Invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with @gm$ T. pallidum @/gm$ can result in spontaneous resolution without an inflammatory response in some cases, while in others, persistent meningitis will develop due to failure to clear organisms from the CSF. Clinically, neurosyphilis can manifest itself with meningeal, vascular, or parenchymatous symptoms. Meningeal symptoms include headache, @di$ photophobia @/di$, neck stiffness, and cranial nerve palsies."	1
Ninety percent of @di$ HUS @/di$ in children are caused by STEC infections (also called STEC-HUS) with STEC @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ as the most frequent serotype responsible for @di$ HUS @/di$ in Europe. Non-@di$ HUS @/di$, less frequent, can be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection or methyl-malonic aciduria or can be atypical @di$ HUS @/di$ (aHUS). This form of @di$ HUS @/di$ occurs at any age, and may be sporadic or familial and a clear link has been demonstrated with genetic abnormalities in complement regulatory genes.	1
No associated tissue @di$ infection @/di$ was found in 14/23 cases (61%). Blood cultures yielded at least one other species in addition to @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ in 10/23 cases (43%). Mortality associated with E. lenta bacteremia was 22% (5/23). E. lenta bacteremia often occurred in patients with advanced cancer disease without documented @di$ infection @/di$.	0
No statistical significance was found in overall microbiome diversity in comparison of healthy gingiva and @di$ gingivitis @/di$ groups. However, bacterial taxa like Mogibacteriaceae and genera @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ and Prevotella were more prevalent in the @di$ gingivitis @/di$ group.	1
No studies have examined the CB consumption effects on gut microflora in diabetic/@di$ obese @/di$ individuals, although CB consumption has been examined in healthy individuals. Chronic BC capsule treatment influenced the intestinal diversity of health promoting and SCOA-producing Anaerostipes, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Faecalibacterium, and Clostridium genera.	2
None of the studies for @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$, the C. leptum group, Oscillospiraceae, or @gm$ Faecalibacterium @/gm$ had measured butyrate, a major fermentation product for these taxa (e.g., after dietary fiber degradation) and an SCFA which has been shown to affect fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism through various mechanisms (Figure 5). However, Wu et al. found that the lower abundance of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ in individuals with prediabetes was accompanied by a reduction of bacterial genes linked to butyrate biosynthesis. Some Oscillospiraceae taxa produce acetate, and 2 studies found a direct association between Oscillospiraceae and circulating acetate. Plasma acetate was furthermore inversely correlated to HbA1c and was lower in individuals with obesity and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ than in insulin-sensitive controls with obesity.	2
"Nonetheless, @gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$ BB536 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 are two probiotic strains that have been previously administered also in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Specifically, there was a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.0001) within two parameters regarding ""@di$ abdominal pain @/di$"" and ""bloating"" and overall severity of disease between IBS patients and placebo."	2
"Nosocomial @di$ Klebsiella infections @/di$ are especially problematic in preterm neonates causing neonatal sepsis, including both early- and late-onset infections. In a recent work, it has been shown that ""healthy"" antibiotic-treated preterm infants hospitalized in NICUs can harbour different Klebsiella spp. such as K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae, K. grimontii and @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$, which could greatly contribute to the resistome."	1
Not only can the gene copy number of KCNK12 allow it to serve as a molecular biomarker for the early detection of diseases (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, tubular breast carcinoma, @di$ synovial sarcoma @/di$, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors) but the expression of these two-pore domain potassium channels also holds promise as an index for therapeutic targets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify KCNK12 as a host classifier for COVID-19. In contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, Acinetobacter pittii, Bacillus sp.	0
Notably, a slight increase in blood LPS was found to be a crucial factor in the onset of low-grade inflammation, and eventually insulin resistance in models of genetically predisposed or diet-induced @di$ obesity @/di$ and diabetes, as well as related cardio metabolic diseases. The relevant and significant literature concentrates mainly on different strains, from more recent prospects such as A. muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are considered to be superior to more traditional probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. According to research by Bo et al., 2020, @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$ was able to reverse the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in @di$ obese @/di$ mice, including the variety of the microbiome and the proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes.	2
Notably, studies have shown that multiplexes probiotics (i.e., combining different strains of specific genera) can be more effective than a single-strain probiotic in the treatment of certain clinical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$. In addition, multiple probiotics are normally applied in AD research and clinical practice. Based on the clinical effect of probiotics on cognitive dysfunction and the doses of probiotics administrated to mice in literature review, we considered ProBiotic-4 (a mixture of B. lactis, L. casei, @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$, and L.	2
Notably, we observed that @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ infection provoked a systemic inflammatory response in SPF mice. The key circulating inflammatory cytokines like SAA and IL-6 significantly increased after @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ inoculation. SAA proteins are acute phase proteins mainly secreted by the liver in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, and their increased levels in serum have been associated with several chronic inflammation-based diseases, such as obesity, hyperglycemia, @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ and cardiovascular disease. SAA has also been reported to be involved in LPS signaling pathway that links inflammation to metabolic disorders in mice, for instance, de Oliveira et al. found that high fat diet induced metabolic endotoxaemia, and, body weight gain and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ could be prevented by an SAA-targeted antisense oligonucleotide treatment. IL-6 also represents a keystone cytokine in infection and inflammation, which elicits cellular immune responses to affected cells and mucosal humoral responses directed against reinfection. Increasing serum levels of IL-6 provides the basis for the amplification step of chronic inflammatory proliferation. We also detected the levels of serum LBP and TNF-alpha, their levels in BW group tended to be higher than NC group, while the differences were not statistically significant. Similar phenomenon has also been reported in both humans and rats, that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were in parallel with the abundance change of @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$.	1
OBJECTIVE: Patients with @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ have varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora and probiotics can improve some of the symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction in these patients. In the present study, blood ammonia, fecal pH, fecal ammonia, and plasma endotoxin were measured after administration of two kinds of probiotics in order to detect the changes in intestinal flora. METHODS: Six bacteria and yeast were cultured and the colony forming units were counted. Fifty cirrhotic patients were randomized to receive probiotic capsules containing Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus, or probiotic capsules containing @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ and Enterococcus faecium for 14 days. Fecal flora, pH and ammonia, blood ammonia (detected by test paper) and plasma endotoxin (detected by LAL test kits) were measured before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Patients with @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ had varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora as shown by a decrease in the Bifidobacterium count (10.04 +/- 0.78 vs 9.48 +/- 1.13, P < 0.05). The severity of the imbalance was matched by that of liver dysfunction, with the most serious imbalance observed in Child-Pugh C patients. Both types of probiotic increased the Bifidobacterium count (9.46 +/- 1.09 vs 10.30 +/- 1.11, 9.81 +/- 0.62 vs 10.44 +/- 1.08, respectively, P < 0.05) and reduced the levels of fecal pH and fecal and blood ammonia (P < 0.05). Probiotics containing @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ and E. faecium reduced the level of endotoxin in cirrhotic patients with endotoxemia (0.0876 +/- 0.0117 Eu/mL vs 0.0685 +/- 0.0246 Eu/mL, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ have an imbalance of intestinal bacteria flora.	2
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the early clinical profiles and outcomes of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates with late-onset sepsis caused by @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of VLBW neonates whose blood and/or cerebral spinal fluid yielded @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ after 3 days of hospitalization in our neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: From January 1997 to December 2006, a total of 29 episodes of E. cloacae infection occurred in 28 VLBW neonates. The onset of E. cloacae infection ranged from 4 to 70 days (27.4 +/- 9.6) days after birth. The most common symptoms and signs of sepsis were desaturation (58.6%), tachycardia (58.6%), apnea (55.2%), unstable body temperature (48.3%), and decreased activity (44.8%). The infected neonates had an average of four kinds of symptoms in each sepsis episode. The most common laboratory findings in VLBW neonates with @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ sepsis were @di$ thrombocytopenia @/di$ (65.5%), C-reactive protein > or = 1 mg/dL (55.2%), band-form neutrophils > or = 5% (41.4%), and leucopoenia (20.7%). Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy comprising piperacillin (or piperacillin and tazobactam) and gentamicin (or amikacin) was successful in the early treatment of 24 episodes of @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ sepsis in 25 patients. Three neonates (10.7%) died due to @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ sepsis. Four neonates (14.3%) developed @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ meningitis, and two of them developed brain abscesses.	1
OBJECTIVE: This retrospective surveillance study aimed to follow @di$ periodontitis @/di$-associated bacterial profiles and to identify time-dependent changes in antibiotic susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2008 to 2015, bacterial specimen from deep periodontal pockets were collected from a total of 7804 German adults diagnosed with @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Presence of selected bacteria was confirmed by anaerobic culture and nucleic acid amplification. Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates was tested by disc diffusion with antibiotics used for the treatment of @di$ periodontitis @/di$ and oral infections. The prevalences of @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ were calculated and temporal evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility towards amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, metronidazole, doxycycline, clindamycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin was analysed with logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients harbouring bacteria was 95.9% Fusobacterium nucleatum, 88.0% Tannerella forsythia, 76.4% @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$, 76.5%, Campylobacter rectus, 76.0% Eikenella corrodens, 75.0% Capnocytophaga spp., 68.2% Porphyromonas gingivalis, 57.7% Peptostreptococcus micros, 43.1% Prevotella intermedia, 30.4% Eubacterium nodatum and 21.5% Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In 63.5% of patients, one or more isolates were not susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics tested. The data further revealed a trend towards decreasing susceptibility profiles (p < 0.05) with antibiotic non-susceptibilities in 37% of patients in 2008 and in 70% in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed a high prevalence of @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ in the subgingival microbiota of German @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients.	1
OBJECTIVE: This study used CD @di$ obesity @/di$-prone (OP) and @di$ obesity @/di$-resistant (OR) rats to examine how weight gain and fat accretion relate to fermentation levels and microbiota composition after feeding resistant starch (RS). METHODS: After feeding OP rats and OR rats a high-fat (HF) diet for 4 weeks, rats were stratified into three groups: they were fed either an HF diet (group 1: HF-HF) or were switched to a low-fat (LF) diet (group 2: HF-LF) or an LF diet supplemented with 20% RS by weight for 4 weeks (group 3: HF-LFRS). Energy intake, body weight, fermentation variables, and microbiota composition were determined. RESULTS: In OP rats, RS elicited robust fermentation (increased cecal contents, short-chain fatty acids, and serum glucagon-like peptide 1). Total bacteria, species of the Bacteroidales family S24-7, and the archaean @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ increased. The robust fermentation did not elicit higher weight or fat accretion when compared with that of control rats fed the same isocaloric diets (HF-LF +- RS). In OR rats, body weight and fat accretion were also not different between HF-LF +- RS diets, but RS elicited minimal changes in fermentation and microbiota composition. CONCLUSIONS: Robust fermentation did not contribute to greater weight. Fermentation levels and changes in microbiota composition in response to dietary RS differed by @di$ obesity @/di$ phenotype.	2
OBJECTIVE: To analyze data for 60 poultry flocks voluntarily enrolled in the Pennsylvania @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ Pilot Project and determine management and environmental risk factors associated with production of @gm$ S enteritidis @/gm$-contaminated eggs. SAMPLE POPULATION: 60 flocks for which at least 1 environmental sample (manure or egg-handling equipment) was positive for @di$ S enteritidis @/di$. PROCEDURE: Samples of manure, egg-handling equipment, and mice were submitted for bacterial culture of @di$ S enteritidis @/di$. When @gm$ S enteritidis @/gm$ was isolated from environmental samples, 1,000 eggs were collected from the flock every 2 weeks for 8 weeks and submitted for bacterial culture. RESULTS: 18 flocks were found to have produced contaminated eggs. Estimated overall prevalence of contaminated eggs was 2.64/10,000 eggs produced, but flock-specific prevalence ranged from 0 to 62.5/10,000 eggs. Flocks with high levels of manure contamination were 10 times as likely to produce contaminated eggs as were flocks with low levels. However, 5 flocks with low levels of manure contamination produced contaminated eggs. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the level of manure contamination could be used to help identify flocks at risk of producing @gm$ S enteritidis @/gm$-contaminated eggs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Flocks with high levels of @gm$ S enteritidis @/gm$-contaminated manure appeared to pose the greatest public health threat, and on-farm programs to reduce the prevalence of egg contamination should be developed for farms with high levels of manure contamination.	1
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the risk of fatal toxic shock caused by @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ in women who had a recent medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. METHODS: We performed active and passive surveillance for cases of toxic shock associated with medical or spontaneous abortion. To identify the cause of toxic shock, immunohistochemical assays for multiple bacteria were performed on formalin-fixed surgical and autopsy tissues. We extracted DNA from tissues, performed Clostridium species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays, and sequenced amplified products for confirmation of Clostridium species. RESULTS: We report four patients with toxic shock associated with Clostridium species infection after medical or spontaneous abortion. Two women had fatal Clostridium perfringens infections after medically induced abortions: one with laminaria and misoprostol and one with the regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol. One woman had a nonfatal Clostridium sordellii infection after spontaneous abortion. Another woman had a fatal C sordellii infection after abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. All four patients had a rapidly progressive illness with necrotizing @di$ endomyometritis @/di$. CONCLUSION: Toxic shock after abortion can be caused by C perfringens as well as @gm$ C sordellii @/gm$, can be nonfatal, and can occur after spontaneous abortion and abortion induced by medical regimens other than mifepristone and misoprostol.	1
OBJECTIVE: To establish the baseline preoperative prevalence of @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ (@gm$ OF @/gm$) colonization in a cohort of obese patients scheduled for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and determine the effect of @gm$ OF @/gm$ colonization on urinary oxalate excretion. It has been proposed that loss of @gm$ OF @/gm$ colonization after RYGB may contribute to the development of @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$. METHODS: Adult patients scheduled to undergo RYGB were requested to provide a stool specimen and 24-hour urine collection before surgery. @gm$ OF @/gm$ colonization status was determined by the calcium precipitation test. The 24-hour urine specimens were analyzed by the Litholink Corporation (Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Of the 51 patients submitting initial stool specimens, only 8 (16%) tested positive for @gm$ OF @/gm$, whereas 43 (84%) were negative. Patients colonized with @gm$ OF @/gm$ were older than uncolonized subjects (52.9+-6.8 vs 46.0+-10.4 years, P=.03). Urinary oxalate was not significantly different between these groups (P=.14). CONCLUSION: @gm$ OF @/gm$ colonization is uncommon in morbidly obese patients (16%) before surgery. Because @di$ hyperoxaluria @/di$ develops in more than 50% of patients after RYGB, it is unlikely that loss of @gm$ OF @/gm$ colonization is the primary cause.	0
OBJECTIVE: To reduce @di$ secondary caries @/di$, glass ionomer luting cements are often used for cementing of indirect restorations. This is because of their well-known antimicrobial potential through the release of fluoride ions. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of five dental luting cements which were based on glass ionomer cement technology. METHODS: Five different glass ionomer based luting cements were tested for their antimicrobial effects on @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ in two different experimental setups: (i) determination of colony-forming units (CFUs) in a plate-counting assay; (ii) live/dead staining (LDS) and fluorescence microscopy.	2
OBJECTIVE: We explored the effects of @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ (@gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$) in Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Neonatal NEC and normal healthy volunteers were collected for this study. Neonatal mice were administered with LPS and then exposed to @di$ hypoxia @/di$ as a mice model of NEC. THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS as an in vitro model of NEC. RESULTS: We have demonstrated @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ abundance correlated with patients with Neonatal NEC or mice with Neonatal NEC. Furthermore, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ stimulated colitis and increased inflammation in mice and in vitro models. LncRNA ENO1-IT1 was an important target for @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ in NEC-inflammation. MiR-22-3p was a target gene of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ in NEC via LncRNA ENO1-IT1. Next, IRF5 was a target gene of miR-22-3p in the function of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ in NEC via LncRNA ENO1-IT1. Silencing IRF5 or over-expressing miR-22-3p relieved the role of lncRNA ENO1-IT1 on inflammation in NEC via CD206 and CD86 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate that @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ is mechanically, biologically and clinically connected to NEC. LncRNA ENO1-IT1 may be important targets for @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ in NEC-inflammation, and a meaningful in treating patients with Neonatal NEC with elevated @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$.	1
OBJECTIVE: We report the first case of bilateral contact lens-related Aeromonas caviae keratitis associated with @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ contamination of the contact lens case. The presence of virulence factors produced by Aeromonas species was also investigated. DESIGN: Case report. INTERVENTION AND TESTING: Conjunctival swabs and corneal scrapings from both eyes were inoculated for culture. The contact lens case was also cultured. The isolate was analyzed for the presence of virulence properties, such as gelatinase and protease production. The presence of virulence genes, such as the cytolytic enterotoxin (AHCYTOEN) and type IV Aeromonas pilus (tap) genes, was investigated using polymerase chain reaction. The susceptibility of @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ to 6 commercial contact lens disinfecting solutions was tested. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Culture results, protease activity, and gelatinase production were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction amplification products were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Bacterial growth after exposure to contact lens disinfecting solutions was assessed. RESULTS: @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ was grown bilaterally from the conjunctiva, cornea, and contact lens case. The organism showed protease and gelatinase production. Polymerase chain reaction amplification revealed that the @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$ strain contained the AHCYTOEN and tap virulence genes. Incubation for the minimum recommended time with all tested disinfecting solutions was effective in killing @gm$ A. caviae @/gm$. CONCLUSIONS: @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ should be considered a possible etiologic agent of contact lens-associated @di$ keratitis @/di$. The presence of virulence factors may be important in determining corneal infection. Commercial contact lens disinfecting solutions, along with proper lens case hygiene, may be effective in preventing @di$ A. caviae keratitis @/di$ in soft contact lens wearers.	1
OBJECTIVES: @di$ Enteric fever @/di$ remains an important diagnostic and treatment challenge in febrile children living in the tropics. In the context of a national Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A outbreak, the objective of this retrospective study was to compare features of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A infections in Cambodian children. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features were reviewed for 192 blood culture-confirmed children with S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A infections presenting to a paediatric referral hospital in Siem Reap, 2012-2016. RESULTS: Children with S. Typhi infections were younger, were more likely to have chills and/or diarrhoea, and were more frequently hospitalized than those with S. Paratyphi A infections. Over three quarters (88.3%) of S. Typhi isolates were multidrug-resistant, compared to none of the @gm$ S. Paratyphi A. @/gm$ CONCLUSIONS: In this small study of Cambodian children, S. Typhi infections were more severe than S. Paratyphi A infections. Antibiotic resistance limits treatment options for @di$ enteric fever @/di$ in this population.	1
OBJECTIVES: @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ is an emerging pathogen. Like Klebsiella pneumoniae, this species is able to acquire antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via mobile genetic elements. In this context, @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ isolates producing carbapenemases of KPC, NDM, IMP and OXA-48-like types have already been reported. Here we characterised a strain (@di$ BD-50 @/di$-Km) isolated from a rectal swab of a Turkish patient hospitalised in Switzerland. METHODS: Species identification was initially performed using MALDI-TOF/MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by the microdilution method. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed with both Illumina and Nanopore platforms and was used to confirm species identification, to characterise plasmids and to perform core-genome analyses. RESULTS: BD-50-Km was initially identified as Klebsiella oxytoca and showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem. However, WGS indicated that the isolate was actually @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$. BD-50-Km carried the blaVIM-1 gene associated with a rare class 1 integron (In87) located on a pST1 196 kb IncC plasmid. This plasmid shares its backbone with many other IncC plasmids found in different species (including five @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$), but not the same In87 and the remaining region harbouring various ARGs. BD-50-Km belongs to the novel ST342. Moreover, core-genome analysis (single nucleotide variant analysis) showed that BD-50-Km was not closely related to any @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ strains deposited in NCBI (n = 212), including the 38 so far reported as possessing carbapenemase genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a blaVIM-possessing @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ clinical isolate.	1
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the different fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis in adult Spanish patients with chronic periodontitis, patients with @di$ gingivitis @/di$ and periodontally healthy subjects, and the relationship between these genotypes and other periodontopathogenic bacteria. STUDY DESIGN: Samples of subgingival plaque were taken from 86 patients (33 with chronic periodontitis, 16 with @di$ gingivitis @/di$, and 37 periodontally healthy) in the course of a full periodontal examination. PCR was employed to determine the presence of the 6 fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (I-V and Ib) and of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$ and Treponema denticola. RESULTS: Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib were present in significantly higher percentages in periodontal patients (39.4% and 12.1% respectively) than in healthy or @di$ gingivitis @/di$ subjects. The prevalence of @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotype IV was significantly higher in the group that presented bleeding greater than 30%.	0
OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association of equol production with @di$ obesity @/di$ and explored the mediating roles of equol-related gut microbiota and microbial carnitine metabolites. METHODS: This 6.6-y prospective study included 2958 Chinese adults (2011 females and 947 males) aged 60.6 +- 6.0 y (mean +- SD) at baseline. Urinary equol and isoflavones were measured using HPLC-tandem MS. BMI, percentage fat mass (%FM), and serum triglycerides (TGs) were assessed every 3 y. Metagenomics sequencing and assessment of carnitine metabolites in feces were performed in a subsample of 897 participants. RESULTS: Urinary equol, but not daidzein and genistein, was independently and inversely associated with the @di$ obesity @/di$-related indicators of BMI, %FM, and a biomarker (TGs). Equol producers (EPs) had lower odds of adiposity conditions and a reduced risk of 6.6-y @di$ obesity @/di$ progression than non-EPs among total participants. Gut microbial analyses indicated that EPs had higher microbiome species richness (P = 3.42 x 10-5) and significantly different beta-diversity of gut microbiota compared with the non-EP group (P = 0.001), with 20 of 162 species differing significantly. EPs (compared with non-EPs) had higher abundances of @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ and Coprococcus catus but lower abundances of Ruminococcus gnavus (false discovery rate <0.05). Among the 7 determined fecal acylcarnitine metabolites, palmitoylcarnitine, oleylcarnitine 18:1, and stearylcarnitine were inversely associated with EPs but positively correlated with @di$ obesity @/di$ conditions and progression. Path analyses indicated that the beneficial association between equol and @di$ obesity @/di$ might be mediated by gut microbiota and decreased production of 3 acylcarnitines in feces. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a beneficial association between equol and @di$ obesity @/di$, mediated by the gut microbiome and acylcarnitines, in adults.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03179657.	2
OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to delineate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with bacteremia caused by @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with Campylobacter bacteremia were treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital from 1998 to 2008. All isolates from the 24 patients were confirmed to the species level by multiplex PCR (cadF, hipO and asp gene) and 16S RNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Bacteremia was caused by @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ in 15 (62.5%) patients, Campylobacter fetus in 6 (25%), and Campylobacter jejuni in 3 (12.5%). Of the 24 patients, 16 were male. The major underlying conditions included chronic renal insufficiency (41.7%), @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ (37.5%), malignancy (33.3%), and previous abdominal surgery (33.3%). The most common infections were intra-abdominal infection (54.2%), followed by primary bacteremia (41.7%), and cellulitis (4.2%). The mean Pittsburgh bacteremia score was 2.5 (range, 0-9). During the bacteremic episodes, six (25%) patients developed septic shock. Third-generation cephalosporins were administered to 12 (50%) patients as empirical therapy. All-cause mortality was 4.2% at 14 days and 12.5% at 30 days. The majority of the isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) values of 32 mg/L for cefotaxime, 128 mg/L for ceftriaxone, and 32 mg/L for both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. All isolates possessed a parC mutation (Arg-139-Gln) and 15 exhibited an additional gyrA mutation (Thr-86-Ile). Among these isolates, 20.8% were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC<=0.5 mg/L). CONCLUSION: Bacteremia caused by antimicrobial resistant @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species is alarming although the mortality rate is low.	1
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and bft subtypes among patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$. In addition, we assessed whether DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) and neuraminidase (nanH) genes are useful determinants for identification of B. fragilis compared to 16S rRNA sequencing as a reference method. METHODS: The 530 fecal specimens were cultured on BBE agar. The colonies which supposed to be a member of B. fragilis group were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and PCR assays targeting the Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG), gyrB and nanH. The B. fragilis toxin (bft) gene and its subtype was detected by PCR. The specificity of PCR assays was calculated considering the 16S rRNA gene sequencing as the reference method. RESULTS: A total of 111 Gram-negative anaerobic coccobacilli were isolated from 530 fecal specimens using BBE agar. Of the 111 isolates, 100 (90.09%) were assumed to be a member of Bacteroides fragilis group as they yielded an amplicon through PCR using the group-specific primers (Bfra-F/g-Bfra-R). However, only 28 isolates out of 100 were definitively identified as species of Bacteroides using16S rRNA gene sequencing; of which 15 isolates were B. fragilis and the remaining 13 isolates were identified as B. thetaiotaomicron (n = 6), Parabacteroides distasonis (n = 3), B. vulgatus (Phocaeicola vulgatus) (n = 1), @gm$ B. ovatus @/gm$ (n = 1), B. congonensis (n = 1) and B. nordii (n = 1). Among the 15 isolates of B. fragilis, 4 were found to be ETBF. Compared to the reference method, the specificity and accuracy of the PCR targeting gyrB gene (64.7% and 65%) was higher than of nanH (36.4% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that more than one-fourth of B. fragilis isolates harbored bft gene and less than 1% of patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ harbored ETBF.	1
Obesity and its associated-metabolic diseases, @di$ IBD @/di$, and CRC are recognized as multi-factorial diseases with a globally rising disease incidence. Their etiology involves a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and immune-mediated factors. The three disease entities share a common basis of chronic inflammation associated with dysbiotic intestinal bacterial communities, characterized by reduced richness, in addition to a reduction of beneficial microbes and an expansion of putative pathobionts. Alterations in intestinal bacteria composition have been described in obesity and T2DM. Previous reports showed an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Veillonella, Blautia, Anaerostipes, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Clostridiales in T2DM. On the contrary, a reduced abundance of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$, Oscillospira and the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila was shown to be associated with improved metabolic health. Similarly, in @di$ IBD @/di$, inflammatory responses in humans as well as experimental mouse models are linked to the over-representation of certain pathobionts such as Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB), adhering invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), and Enterococcus faecalis and the reduction in beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae.	2
Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and @di$ vision loss @/di$ in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB.	1
Of 62 other Bacteroides tested, only two of four strains of @gm$ B ovatus @/gm$, two of three strains of B thetaiotaomicron, and two of four strains of B uniformis were heparinase producers. None of the 48 strains of fusobacteria or seven strains of Veillonella produced heparinase. The anaerobic cocci (19 peptococci and seven peptostreptococci) were also negative for heparinase production as were 46 Clostridium spp tested. It was concluded that heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria was unlikely to play a part in the regional @di$ thrombophlebitis @/di$ that sometimes occurs in anaerobic infections.	0
Of all the taxa in this analysis, @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ was the only one identified by both WQSRSRH and TWAS to have a negative association with Pb exposure in the second and third trimesters. @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ is a common member of the human gut microbiome, and relatively newly identified. Little is known about the health implications of @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$. However, one study has identified it as protective against @di$ liver fibrosis @/di$., and another identified it as a keystone species for restoring a healthy gut microbiome in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, the Alistipes genus has been shown to have both beneficial and detrimental health effects in humans. Continued investigation of the health implications of @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ are necessary to understand the links between prenatal Pb exposure and downstream health status via the microbiome.	2
Of interest is the @di$ bacteremia of @/di$ unknown origin (BUO), a community-acquired blood infection which cannot be attributed to a specific infectious locus, and the causative bacteria can be retrieved only from the blood of the patient. Reports estimate 40 to 154 cases per 100,000 annually with a mortality rate higher than that of the nosocomial-acquired @di$ bacteremia @/di$. Among the MR bacteria detected in the flea-pools of our study, the following are described as causative agents of BUO: B. fragilis, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and F. nucleatum. However, bacteria not satisfying the ICD-11 criterion, but reported as BUO causative agents, were also detected: Streptococcus equi, Elizabethkingia miricola, Gemella haemolysans, Parvimonas micra, Eubacterium hadrum, E. saphenum, @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$, E.	1
Of note, some of our identified species, such as @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$, E. biforme, and R. hominis, have not been specifically linked to TMAO in prior studies and therefore require further replications. Despite that our study participants were of old age, our findings on TMAO-predicting species and their interactions with diet in association with TMAO levels were independent of many risk factors including participants' renal function, HbA1c levels, and @di$ obesity @/di$ status.	0
Of note, the fermentation of dietary fibers to produce butyrate is largely mediated by gut microbiota including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, E. halli, and others. Thus, it is relevant to propose that the gut microbiome could influence the dietary impact of butyrate. A smaller population of butyrate-producing bacteria such as @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Clostridium, and Eubacterium was observed in advanced CRA patients along with a lower production of butyrate, highlighting the importance of gut microbiota in modulating the production of butyrate to protect hosts from colonic neoplasm. Conversely, butyrate could change the composition of gut microbiota to attenuate the detrimental effect of high-fat diet, resulting in an improve intestinal barrier and attenuated @di$ obesity @/di$ or steatohepatitis.	2
Of the 116 @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ isolates identified from male patients with indigenous cases of shigellosis, 7 (6.0%) were resistant to cefotaxime (Table 2), which were also resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ampicillin: 3 identified from MSM and 4 from PLWH. One fatality occurred in a 56-year-old HIV-uninfected male patient with cefotaxime-resistant shigellosis, who presented with @di$ fever @/di$ and diarrhoea that rapidly evolved into septic shock and died of hospital-acquired pneumonia after 27 days of hospitalization.	1
Of the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genus Bacteroides decreased in two studies treated with metformin among newly diagnosed T2D patients, and in two studies treated with acarbose among pre-@di$ diabetic @/di$ and newly diagnosed T2D patients. Additionally, one study treated with metformin and one study treated with acarbose in newly diagnosed T2D patients reported similar results of decreases in seven species (e.g., Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides finegoldii). For the phylum Firmicutes, the genus Lactobacillus increased in two studies in pre-@di$ diabetic @/di$ and newly diagnosed T2D patients receiving acarbose, and the species L. gasseri increased in one study treated with metformin, and with acarbose, respectively, among newly diagnosed T2D patients. Meanwhile, the genus @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ decreased in one study among healthy participants receiving metformin which was also reported in newly diagnosed T2D patients treated with acarbose (Table 4). Two species, i.e., C. bartlettii and @gm$ C. botulinum @/gm$, consistently decreased among T2D patients receiving metformin in two separate studies.	2
Of the total of 113 patients identified during the 12-year period, patients infected with Mycobacterium fortuitum and @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ were younger than those infected with M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) (36 and 44 years vs. 55 years, P=0 004 and P=0 056, respectively), and were more likely to have previous invasive procedures than those infected with MAC and M. abscessus (81 8% and 72 0% vs. 27 8% and 54 8%, P=0 007), and less likely to have associated immunosuppression (9 1% and 24% vs. 66 7% and 45 2%, P=0 006). @di$ Granuloma @/di$ was more often observed in immunocompetent patients (60 1% vs. 40%, P=0 019), and in @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$-infected specimens (78 3%).	1
Of the various species, Aeromonas hydrophila, @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$, Aeromonas veronii, and Aeromonas jandaei are most frequently associated with acute enteritis and foodborne infections. All typically cause persistent watery diarrhea. Patients often have abdominal pain and dysenteric-like symptoms can occur, but fecal leukocytes and red cells are usually absent from stool. Nausea, vomiting, and @di$ fever @/di$ may occur in up to 50% of patients.	1
Of these 17 peptides, the hprt4-18 peptide, found in the normal human gut commensal @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$, activated both human T cell clones from T1D patients and T cell hybridomas from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice specific to insB:9-23. Immunization of NOD mice with @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ insB:9-23 peptide mimic or insB:9-23 peptide verified immune cross-reactivity. Colonization of female NOD mice with @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ accelerated the development of T1D, increasing macrophages, dendritic cells, and destructive CD8+ T cells, while decreasing FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Western blot analysis identified @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$-reacting antibodies in sera of NOD mice colonized with @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ and human T1D patients. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from P. distasonis-treated mice to NOD/@di$ SCID @/di$ mice enhanced disease phenotype in the recipients.	1
On E14, dams were restrained and inoculated vaginally with two immediately successive 10 muL inoculations as follows: PBS and PBS (mock vehicle controls); @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ then PBS; PBS then GBS; @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ then GBS. This small volume of liquid was entirely taken up into the vagina (it did not pool at the introitus). To further ensure that the inoculum was maintained in the vagina, the mouse was restrained stationary with its tail end raised up for ~30 seconds before being returned to its cage. An initial experiment confirmed that the order of inoculation of the two bacteria did not affect colonization or infection. Previous studies reported that a 108 colony forming units (cfu) inoculum of GBS strain COH1 resulted in vaginal colonization and ascending intrauterine infection in >90% of pregnant mice and intrauterine fetal demise and/or @di$ PTB @/di$ in 16-40% of pups . As a positive control, we included a small number of mice inoculated with 108 cfu of GBS (GBShigh), but used a ten-fold lower 107 dose of GBS (GBSlow) in our co-inoculation model. The dose of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ was ~108 colony forming units (cfu) and the dose of GBS was either 107 or 108 cfu.	1
On admission, sputum and blood for cultures, serum for measuring antibodies and urine for Streptococcus pneumoniae or @gm$ L. pneumophila @/gm$ antigen test were collected to detect as clearly as possible the causative microorganisms of CAP. @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ species was identified using culture on WYO-alpha medium, not by polymerase chain reaction. We diagnosed @di$ Legionella pneumonia @/di$ due to non-L.	1
On day 25, he was diagnosed with cholangitis and @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$ bacteremia. He had complication of proteus vulgaris pneumonia and peripheral neuropathy [aetiology not stated]. He received cefotaxime as antibiotic therapy. Cholangitis was attributed to ketamine. He was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. On day 66, hepatic MRI revealed a periportal hypersignal without hepatic biliary dilatation. On day 74, liver biopsy showed interlobular biliary lesions with cholestasis, without evidence for @di$ infection @/di$. The day after, he was discharged home. On day 84, he had readmitted with recurrent cholangitis and @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$ bacteremia.	1
On postnatal day 4, he began sleeping more than usual and experienced hypoactivity, pallor, jaundice, seizures, @di$ metabolic acidosis @/di$, and finally respiratory insufficiency, necessitating mechanical ventilation and empiric treatment with cefepime and ampicillin. We obtained 2 blood cultures on postnatal day 4 that yielded @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ spp. with resistance to cephalothin and cefoxitin, intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin, and susceptibility to other antimicrobial drugs, including cefepime and ampicillin. A transfontanel ultrasound on postnatal day 6 showed grade 2 periintraventricular hemorrhage with hypoxic-ischemic lesions. Subsequent computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging revealed biparietal cerebral abscess (Figure). Culture of the cerebral abscess on postnatal day 33 yielded @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ spp.	1
On the contrary, @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$, is the most common catalase-positive species, and presumably the most common cause of clinical campylobacteriosis, even though it can be found in normal individuals. Clinical manifestation of campylobacteriosis is non-specific and includes diarrhoea (bloody or watery), abdominal pain and @di$ fever @/di$. Campylobacteriosis is most frequently a self-limiting disease; however, sometimes antimicrobial treatment is required. These findings are consistent with our case study: The dog was in fact hospitalized due to acute and complicated hemorrhagic colitis caused by both @gm$ Campylobacter jejuni @/gm$ and Campylobacter upsaliensis enteritis and needed a specific antimicrobial treatment.	1
On the contrary, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, Clostridium clostridioforme, Blautia producta, Bifidobacterium adolescent, and Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum taxa were significantly more abundant in the HC group ( Figure 2C ). There was no significant difference in the fecal microbiota among the EC, @di$ GC @/di$, and CRC groups.	0
On the one hand, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio and the growth of bacterial species associated with diet-induced @di$ obesity @/di$ were decreased, including Erysipelotrichaceae, Bacillus spp. and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$.	2
On the other hand, toxicity in the liver is resolved by the time the 21-nt injected mice die of @di$ cardiomyopathy @/di$, as indicated by ALT and AST levels (Figure 1C); therefore, the mechanism of transient @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$-mediated liver toxicity is different from AAV8-mediated liver shRNA toxicity, which revolves around miR-122 levels.	0
Once a patient has failed a 4 to 8 weeks trial of empiric treatment or failed to respond to eradication of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$, upper endoscopy is indicated. Endoscopy alone is insufficient because it may miss serious mucosal lesions in about 15 to 30% of cases that can be picked up later on by histological examination. Biopsy is convenient procedure for accurate assessment and diagnosis of premalignant gastric lesions. Moreover, the biopsy is important for identifying and grading various mucosal pathologic lesions. The sites for biopsy taking from stomach according to the Sydney-Houston system are from the antrum, the angulus, and the corpus. The aim of this study was to determine histopathological features of gastric and duodenal mucosal biopsies in @di$ dyspepsia @/di$ with normal looking upper GI endoscopy.	1
One clinical study showed that the administration of Lactobacillus helviticus and @gm$ Bifidobacterium longum @/gm$ helps to reduce the @di$ obsessive-compulsive @/di$ scores in healthy volunteers. Thus, there is some evidence that probiotics may play a role in the treatment of @di$ OCD @/di$; however, the research is in its infancy at this time to draw any significant conclusions.	2
One hundred and fourteen @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ strains obtained in 1991 to 2000 were tested for their susceptibilities to 12 antimicrobial agents. Nalidixic acid (NA) resistance was found in 2 of 15 strains (13.3%) in 1993, 2 of 8 strains (25%) in 1996, one of 5 strains (20%) in 1998, 7 of 21 strains (33.3%) in 1999 and 6 of 12 strains (50%) in 2000. The incidence of resistance to NA in @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ strains increased significantly during this period. Among those 19 NA resistant strains, 11 strains were derived from patients with traveler's diarrhea and 8 strains were derived from patients who had not traveled abroad before the @di$ infection @/di$, namely domestic patients. PFGE analysis with Xba I revealed that all strains tested differentiated into two major clonal clusters, one cluster consisted of strains derived from patients who had traveled to India after 1993, and another cluster included strains derived from domestic patients. Mechanism of NA resistance was examined by sequencing the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA gene. Among 19 NA resistant strains tested, 11 strains presented a change at Ser-83 to Leu and 7 strains presented a change at Asp-87 to Try (5 strains) or Asn (2 strains), whereas 3 NA sensitive strains had no change in the region. These findings indicated that this mutation in gyrA plays an important role in acquisition of Nalidixic-acid resistance in clinical isolates of @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$.	1
One of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (PTB) is acute @di$ genitourinary tract infection @/di$. The bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include Gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low birth weight. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ (@gm$ Pg @/gm$), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(Fn), and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations.	1
One of the pathophysiological processes in @di$ IVD degeneration @/di$ is the programmed cell death of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), as NPCs are critical to the maintenance of the mechanical and biochemical homeostases of IVDs. It was initially thought that apoptosis is the main death form of NPCs, and previous research demonstrated that @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ causes the apoptosis of NPCs, which induces @di$ IVD degeneration @/di$.	1
One particular group of gut microbes, the methanogenic archaea (methanogens), has been specifically linked to altered metabolism and @di$ weight gain @/di$ . These anaerobic organisms utilize hydrogen, formate and other substrates produced by neighboring microbes to generate methane . In humans, the predominant methanogen is @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ , and there is increasing evidence for a specific role for @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and methane production in @di$ weight gain @/di$ and the development of obesity .	1
One patient developed critical multi-organ dysfunctions partly explained by extensive necrotizing fasciitis/myositis originating from an @gm$ Aeromonas sobria @/gm$ wound infection. This resulted in rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and @di$ acute kidney injury @/di$.	1
One requirement for the pathogenesis of @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$, the causative agent of bubonic plague, is the yersiniabactin (Ybt) siderophore-dependent iron transport system that is encoded within a high-pathogenicity island (HPI) within the pgm locus of the @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ chromosome. Nine gene products within the HPI have demonstrated functions in the nonribosomal @di$ peptide @/di$ synthesis (NRPS)/polyketide (PK) synthesis or transport of Ybt. NRPS/PK synthetase or synthase enzymes are generally activated by phosphopantetheinylation. However, no products with similarities to known phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) transferases were found within the pgm locus. We have identified a gene, ybtD, encoded outside the HPI and pgm locus, that is necessary for function of the Ybt system and has similarities to other P-pant transferases such as EntD of Escherichia coli. A deletion within ybtD yielded a strain (KIM6-2085+) defective in siderophore production. This strain was unable to grow on iron-deficient media at 37 degrees C but could be cross-fed by culture supernatants from Ybt-producing strains of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$.	1
One such famous association is LS, which is characterized by @di$ thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein @/di$ caused primarily by Fusobacterium necrophorum and @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$. Fusobacterium species are inherently thrombogenic in nature due to their ability to cause platelet aggregation through unclear mechanisms. Thrombus formation and rapid bacterial growth can cause septic embolization to distant sites. Mortality burden varied from 5% to 19% in patients afflicted with Fusobacterium species bacteremia. F. necrophorum was widely seen in younger individuals, and @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ was seen in older individuals with comorbidities and associated with gastrointestinal (GI) infections and/or malignancy.	1
Only three samples from broilers contained @gm$ K. variicola subsp @/gm$. variicola. This indicates that K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae is the overall dominant @di$ KpSC @/di$ subspecies in the gut of poultry.	0
Oral administration of Nano-Se-@gm$ B. longum @/gm$ may give rise to elevated plasma selenium levels by enhanced hepatic secretion of selenoproteins, which may enhance insulin-induced signal transduction. Therefore, we assessed the effects of Nano-Se-@gm$ B. longum @/gm$ administration on insulin signalling pathways. In our study, Nano-Se-@gm$ B. longum @/gm$ increased the levels of pIRS1 and pAkt proteins and decreased pGSK-3beta in @di$ diabetic @/di$ mice. We can reasonably speculate that an increase in the selenoproteins induced by Nano-Se-@gm$ B. longum @/gm$ treatment enhanced insulin sensitivity by promoting the insulin signalling pathway.	2
Oral diseases such as dental caries, @di$ gingivitis @/di$, periodontitis and periimplantitis are among the most common biofilm diseases. Periodontitis, a chronic, tissue-destructive inflammation, which degrades the attachment apparatus of the teeth, can cause tooth loss and, in its most severe form, edentulousness, the complete loss of all natural teeth. Microbial plaque (biofilm) forms on hard and soft tissues, first supragingivally then subgingivally with mainly the bacterial pathogens of the orange and red complex that strongly associate with periodontitis such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ as etiological agents.	1
Oral flora in @di$ edentulous @/di$ patients is becoming a topic of great interest in dentistry, since dental implants have been increasingly used for prosthodontic rehabilitation. Although dental implant prosthesis is considered an excellent treatment option for the rehabilitation of @di$ edentulous @/di$ patients, its failure can also occur, especially due to periimplantitis. Results from different studies have shown that the microbial component associated with dental implants failure involves periodontal pathogens that cause inflammation of peri-implant tissues, including red-complex bacteria (RCB):Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of periodontal pathogens prior to rehabilitation of @di$ edentulous @/di$ patients should be essential to reduce the chances of failure in the medium and long term.	1
Oral infections are among the most common human bacterial infections, and the gram-negative anaerobe @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ (Baumgartner et al.) is one of the most frequently detected organisms in periodontal disease pockets (Bolstad et al.). However, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ is also one of the most common species found in the subgingival crevice even in the absence of disease (Bolstad et al.), and the categorization of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ as a traditional pathogen or commensal is debatable. However, in current models of oral pathogenicity, health or disease states are not viewed in the context of a single pathogenic organism but rather of dysbiotic microbial communities (Hajishengallis and Lamont). A number of in vivo studies have shown the potential importance of these community interactions, including elevated pathogenicity of polymicrobial communities in rodent @di$ abscess @/di$ models (Ochiai et al.; Yoneda et al.; Kesavalu et al.) and alveolar bone loss models (Daep et al.; Orth et al.; Settem et al.).	1
Oral microbiota including @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$_7, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, and Fusobacterium had higher weighted node connectivity (WNC) scores in @di$ cancerous @/di$ tissues (Figure 4A), while Serratia, Lactococcus, and L. brevis, which were identified above as being enriched in non-@di$ cancer @/di$ group, had higher WNC scores in non-@di$ cancer @/di$ tissues (Figure 4B).	1
Oral mucositis and @di$ xerostomia @/di$ develop in patients with HNSCC receiving RT. @di$ Xerostomia @/di$ is responsible for the alterations of biofilm composition in the supragingival environment. In irradiated tissues, reduction in blood supply, delays in repairing of wound, and reduction in immune response occur that drive proliferation of anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria in the supra or subgingival biofilms. @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$, S mitis, S mutans, S oralis, S sanguinis, and Streptococcus sobrinus are responsible for the development of oral mucositis. The abundance of Porphyromonas and Prevotella genera was decreased in the supragingival biofilm and increased in the gingival sulcus of gingivitis or chronic periodontitis patients. The presence of these microorganisms in the microbial biofilm is associated with poor hygiene and oral conditions as well as alcohol and tobacco consumption which induces adhesion and oral colonization by enteric microorganisms in irradiated patients. The most significant alterations in microbial populations was observed in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The fimbriae of these microorganisms may facilitate adhesion of microbiota to tumor cells that enhances the colonization of microbial organisms in irradiated patients with @di$ xerostomia @/di$.	1
Oral rehydration of infants with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ is an effective therapy that is becoming increasingly available in developing countries. To formulate judicious recommendations for preparation and storage of such solutions, we assessed the capability of recognized bacterial enteropathogens to survive and proliferate in solutions made either with sterile distilled or river water collected in two developing countries. @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$, an enteropathogen typically transmitted by faecal/oral contact rather than by water or food, survived very poorly. In contrast, Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, pathogens classically associated with transmission by food and water, reached concentrations of 103-104 per ml by 12 h and 104-106 by 24 h after inoculation of solutions made with river water and somewhat lower concentrations in distilled water. This potential exposure to bacteria must be considered in the context of the field situation where children are already ingesting high levels of bacteria in drinking water and food and where the oral rehydration solution would probably add little to their exposure. Although it is probably wise to prepare solutions fresh each day with water as free from faecal pollution as possible, in situations where lack of fuel to boil water or scarce supply of glucose/electrolyte packets preclude compliance with these recommendations prompt administration of oral rehydration solutions to infants with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ should nevertheless proceed.	1
Other @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species have shown no sign of ESBLs production. According to these results, the pattern of ESBLs production varies among @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ clinical isolates depending on the infection site. Samples collected from trachea contained highest rate of ESBL production (24.7%), blood and wound samples came second and third on the ranking (21.17% and 3.52% ESBL-producing strains, respectively). Other samples including mucus, urine, abscess, @di$ pleural effusion @/di$ and ascites were negative for ESBL production.	1
Other VRE infections were @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$ in one patient and meningitis in one patient. @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ was isolated in all patients with VRE-I.	1
Other bacterial include- @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$ species and Chromobacterium violaceum. Many apparent infections go undetected on cultures and may require special efforts to determine a specific etiological organism. At least in Sweden, patients with X-linked disease had more infections than the AR counterparts, with dermal abscesses more commonly seen than lymphadenitis or pneumonias. In the Japanese experience at one hospital, of 23 patients treated, nearly half had Aspergillus infection of the lungs, while @di$ short staure @/di$ and underweight were a complication in up to 1/5th of the patients.	0
Other findings of this study that have previously not been reported include association with genera Sellimonas, Lachnoclostridium, Hungatella, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, LachnospiraceaeUCG001, and Ruminococcusgauvreauiigroup. Sellimonas and Hungatella were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Sellimonas is the most significant finding of this study. It belongs to the family Lachnospiraceae and phylum Firmicutes. Species belonging to Sellimonas have been reported to be increased in inflammatory diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. Further, increased abundance of Sellimonas have been observed after dysbiosis. Lachnoclostridium belongs to the family Lachnospiraceae. Higher levels of Lachnoclostridium were associated with increased depressive symptoms in our study and also consistent with the findings of the Bosch et al. study [NCOMMS-21-20669B]. Lachnoclostridium has previously found to be depleted in other psychiatric disorders including @di$ schizophrenia @/di$ and autism and in patients with gastrointestinal tract neoplasms. Hungatella belongs to the family Clostridiaceae and phylum Firmicutes. It has previously been associated with paleolithic diet and is known to produce the precursor molecule for trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO has been implicated in cardio-vascular and neurological diseases including depression. @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ belongs to the family Eubacteriaceae and has been found to be significantly depleted after traumatic brain injury in mice. Major depression is a frequent complication of traumatic brain injury. In our study we also observed depletion of @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ with the increase in depressive symptoms, which fits well with association with traumatic brain injury. In human studies @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ was found to be slightly more abundant in obese individuals.	1
Other genera, @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ and Olsenella with high relative abundance, showed a 3- to 7-fold change after urea, Met, and MD supplementation. Interestingly, lactate is the dominant product from Olsenella, through the action of beta-glucosidase. A classic isolate of the genus, @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$, can convert lactate to butyrate. Theoretically, butyrate concentration should be increased after MD and Met addition. However, the genus Butyrivibrio was enriched in the CON group and can grow on a range of carbohydrates with butyrate production, such as starch and hemicelluloses. The different butyrate-producing bacteria may lead to the invariable butyrate proportion among four groups and another possible reason is that butyrate accounts for a relatively smaller proportion of TVFA, and may be masked by the modification of acetate and propionate. Furthermore, Pitta et al. found that the relative abundance of @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ was decreased by Met analog supplementation after 28 days in dairy cows when exposed to diets with risk for milk fat @di$ depression @/di$.	2
Other infections, including @di$ suppurative cholangitis @/di$, peritonitis, acute otitis, endophthalmitis, etc., have also been reported from these strains. Unfortunately, to date, little research has been done on the distribution and epidemiological features of V. fluvialis, especially in Iran, and it remains largely unknown. Considering that Qom is an endemic region of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ and in recent years some cases of non-agglutinable (NAG) strains have been isolated, our aim was to evaluate the isolation of V.	0
Other significant NFGNB isolated were: Sphingobacterium species (5.2%), @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ (3.1%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.6%). P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem (94%), cefoperazone (70%), amikacin (69%), and ticarcillin (63%). A. baumannii showed 100% sensitivity to imipenem and 70% sensitivity to piperacillin. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were the common NFGNB isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, @di$ bacteremia @/di$, surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia.	1
Other studies demonstrated that the presence of @di$ emphysema @/di$ in lung cancer patients affects lung microbiome. Thus, prevailing Firmicutes (Streptococcus) and Bacteroidetes (Prevotella) can characterize microbial composition of cancer and @di$ emphysema @/di$ patients rather than @di$ emphysema @/di$-only patients. Proteobacteria phylum (i.e., @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ and Acidovorax) is in contrast less commonly in lung cancer cases independently of @di$ emphysema @/di$ presence.	0
Other studies have shown that Escherichia coli and @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$, which have been shown to potentiate carcinogenesis through specific toxins that can induce DNA damage, are enriched in @di$ Barrett's esophagus @/di$.	1
Other studies in rodent models indicate that a decrease in Ruminococcus or some Ruminoccocus species is linked to @di$ depression @/di$ or antidepressant effects. Interestingly, the abundance of Ruminococcus is significantly associated with 5-HT levels in a rodent model of postpartum depression. Different Ruminococcus species are associated with NINONS-associated human disorders that exhibit a strong comorbidity with MDD, including chronic fatigue syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In Parkinson's `disease, those with cognitive impairment had a lower abundance of the genus Ruminococcus than those without cognitive abnormalities. Ruminococcus genus and @gm$ R. callidus @/gm$ are much less prevalent in the feces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.	1
Our CDI diagnosis included only the results of confirmed laboratory diagnosis of @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ toxin assay or culture. It did not detect those patients who may have had received empiric treatment, which may lead to underestimation of CDI in this cohort. Additionally, this study did not account for those patients who were colonized with @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ (tested positive) but did not exhibit symptoms (not infected). The overall influence of these patients that are colonized but not infected are believed to be minimal since they would not qualify for testing without the requisite @di$ diarrhea @/di$ episodes.	1
Our analysis also showed that the abundance of species belonged to Firmicutes (Ruminococcus bromii, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, and Roseburia sp CAG 182) was negatively correlated with HS, AST, ALT, and uric acid levels in the gut microbiome (p < 0.05, Figure 3A and Dataset S5, Supporting Information). Moreover, the characterization of oral microbiome revealed that the abundance of Campylobacter concisus and Capnocytophaga granulosa is negatively correlated, but Eikenella sp NML130454 and Actinomyces johnsonii is positively correlated with HS, ALT, and AST levels (Figure 3B and Dataset S5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, we found that the reduced abundance in some Haemophilus members was negatively correlated with the HS and ALT levels (p < 0.05, Figure 3B and Dataset S5, Supporting Information). Other significantly correlated species with clinical parameters are presented in the Supporting Information, Figure 3A,B, and Dataset S5 in the Supporting Information. As shown in Table  1 , we highlighted several gut microbial species, which were associated with the clinical variables and showed significantly different abundance at least in one of the steatosis groups compared to the none steatosis group. Meanwhile, it has been reported that these species are associated with MAFLD, dietary pattern, or immune dysregulation and contain genes which were linked with some key human metabolic pathways in Human Gut Microbiome Atlas (https://www.microbiomeatlas.org/). The abundance of Ruminococcus bromii is negatively correlated with the fibrosis severity and primary bile acid levels in nonobese MAFLD subjects. The abundance of @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$ is decreased in MAFLD-cirrhosis and negatively correlated with the markers of insulin resistance in postmenopausal women with @di$ obesity @/di$.	2
Our differential analysis showed an enrichment of @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium actinocoloniiforme in CS, while B. pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense are overrepresented in the @di$ VD @/di$ group. Other studies described a delay in the transmission of maternal strains of Bifidobacterium (e.g., Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and B. pseudocatenulatum) in newborns delivered by cesarean (Shao et al.,). Moreover, Saturio et al. reported a higher abundance of B. pseudocatenulatum in the @di$ VD @/di$ and @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$ species in the CS.	0
Our findings demonstrate that (i) maternal STS treatment prevented adult offspring from exhibiting @di$ hypertension @/di$ induced by maternal CKD; (ii) treatment with STS during pregnancy and lactation restores maternal CKD-induced reduction of renal 3MST protein levels and plasma H2S concentration; (iii) the benefits of STS for offspring @di$ hypertension @/di$ are connected to increased NO bioavailability; (iv) maternal treatment with STS alters microbiota beta diversity and composition in adult progeny; (v) maternal CKD reduced genus Enterococcus and increased genera of Erysipelatoclostridium and Dorea, while maternal STS treatment increased genus Dorea, Streptococcus, and Anaerotruncus; and (vi) the beneficial effect of STS against offspring @di$ hypertension @/di$ coincided with increases of beneficial microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Blautia schinkii, and @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$.	2
Our models based on species abundance identified Bifidobacterium species and Flavonifractor plautii as the most important factors for predicting all three @di$ APNS @/di$ outcomes. Specifically, we found higher abundances of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$, B. longum, and B. bifidum were associated with higher PTSD and depression scores, which contradicts some literature regarding positive relationships between Bifidobacterium spp. and improved neuropsychiatric outcomes. Contrary to this, many other microbiome-based studies of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, and anxiety, have failed to find similar associations. Indeed, for MDD, various investigators have found both increased and decreased abundances of Bifidobacterium spp. to be associated with clinical disease suggesting possibly strain specific effects. Our analysis identifying increased abundances of Bifidobacterium spp. as being associated with @di$ APNS @/di$ outcomes adds more contradiction to the literature but highlights the importance of looking beyond species abundances in microbiome studies.	1
Our pathogen screening revealed @gm$ Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C @/gm$ in skeletal remains from the two burial pits, indicating the highly contagious @di$ enteric paratyphoid fever @/di$ as the cause of death.	1
Our patient presented with intracranial hypertension, headache, diplopia, and @di$ papilledema @/di$, and normal brain-MRI. @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ in the CSF was confirmed with PCR-assay.	1
Our recent publication (Chey et al., Nutrients 2020) showed that a 30-day administration of pure galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) significantly reduced symptoms and altered the fecal microbiome in patients with @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$ (@di$ LI @/di$). Results. In this addendum, we performed an in-depth analysis of the fecal microbiome of the 377 @di$ LI @/di$ patients randomized to one of two GOS doses (Low, 10-15 grams/day or High, 15-20 grams/day), or placebo in a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons was done on GOS or placebo groups at weeks zero (baseline), four (end of treatment), nine, 16 and 22. Taxa impacted by treatment and subsequent dairy consumption included lactose-fermenting species of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus. Increased secondary fermentation microorganisms included Coprococcus and Ruminococcus species, Blautia producta, and Methanobrevibacterium. Finally, tertiary fermenters that use acetate to generate butyrate were also increased, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$, and C. eutactus. Conclusions. Results confirmed and expanded data on GOS microbiome modulation in @di$ LI @/di$ individuals.	2
Our results demonstrate that vaginal @gm$ Porphyromonas @/gm$ species are capable of directly degrading fibrinogen and impairing fibrin clot formation. Fibrinogen is detected in vaginal lavage fluid and is targeted by other reproductive pathogens. Although the implications of altered fibrinogen levels in the female reproductive tract are not clear, impaired clotting functions could have severe consequences during labor and postpartum. Fibrinogen is known to increase substantially during pregnancy, and decreased plasma fibrinogen levels have been associated with increased severity of postpartum hemorrhage. Further to this, genetic fibrinogen abnormalities are significantly associated with miscarriage, @di$ placental abruption @/di$, and postpartum hemorrhage.	1
Our results show, for the first time, that long-term oral supplementation with @gm$ BL @/gm$ NCC3001 leads to a beneficial effect on stress relief and improves subjective sleep quality in a healthy adult population reporting moderate levels of psychological stress. In response to the Maastricht Acute Stress Test, momentary subjective assessments revealed a lower amount of pain experience in the probiotic group and a higher amount of relief at the end of the procedure in the placebo group, as reflected by the higher scores in the positive affect state. Multivariate analysis indicated that a reduction in perceived stress correlated with a reduction in @di$ anxiety @/di$, in depression, and in the cortisol awakening response after oral intervention. Larger, powered clinical trials are warranted to confirm the exciting findings on stress relief and sleep quality and provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the stress-relieving and sleep-improving effect of @gm$ BL @/gm$ NCC3001.	2
Our studies identify @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ as a clinically relevant NASH-promoting bacterium. Blautia, a genus of Lachnospiraceae family, has been reported to increase in human patients with NAFLD and decrease after NAFLD treatment in rodents. In contrast, other studies showed that there was a negative correlation between Blautia and visceral fat and inflammatory disease, and depletion of Blautia luti was related to the worsening of @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ in children with obesity. Here, we showed the abundance of Blautia in mice (Fig. 3a, c) and the increase of its family Lachnospiraceae in humans (Supplementary Fig. 7) during NASH development. We demonstrated that Blautia reduction is associated with antibiotic-mediated suppression of NASH pathogenesis (Figs. 3c and 2). In particular, repopulation with Blautia significantly promotes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in WT mice and further progression of NASH in CL-HFS-fed mice (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10). Similarly, supplementation of @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ promotes liver fibrosis in ND-fed mice (Supplementary Fig.	1
Our study has shown the expression of LBP in human gingiva and its significant association with @di$ periodontal @/di$ health and disease. @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ is a key pathogen of periodontal disease. @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS as a main virulence factor is strongly involved in @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogenesis and it displays a significant lipid A structural heterogeneity. Currently, it remains unknown whether, and to what extent, the lipid A structural heterogeneity of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS affects LBP expression. The present study investigated the expression profile of LBP in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) stimulated by two isoforms of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS [tetra- (LPS(1435/1449)) and penta-acylated (LPS(1690))] and Escherichia coli LPS, and the involvement of TLRs in LBP expression. The results showed that the expression of LBP mRNA and peptide was significantly up-regulated by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS(1690) and E. coli LPS, while @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS(1435/1449) did not affect LBP expression. Blocking assay and siRNA gene silencing revealed that @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS(1690)-induced LBP expression was through both TLR2 and TLR4. This in vitro study demonstrates that @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ LPS with a lipid A structural heterogeneity differentially modulates LBP expression in HOKs.	1
Our study not only reports a novel plasmid co-harboring blaIMP-4 and blaNDM-1 but also highlights the putative pathway of plasmid formation and evolution by means of genetic rearrangement through sequence insertion and homologue recombination, which may have critical value for plasmid research and increase awareness of carbapenem-resistant @di$ Enterobacteriaceae @/di$ (@di$ CRE @/di$). IMPORTANCE In this study, we characterized a novel plasmid from a carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. michiganensis @/gm$ (CRKM) isolate, which harbors two metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), IMP-4 and NDM-1, is capable of transconjugation and contains three replicons. Our results first expand the diversity of plasmids co-harboring carbapenemase genes in Enterobacterales, which exhibits epidemic importance in bacterial resistance. Additionally, we investigated the origin and formation of this MBL double-positive plasmid based on comparative genomics analysis, which indicated that IS26 plays a vital role through continuous genetic rearrangements. Moreover, this plasmid is unstable in transconjugants during passage at the multidrug-resistant (MDR) region of blaNDM-1, with fluctuating stability under varying antibiotic selection, highlighting auspicious considerations regarding recognition of the complexity and plasticity of plasmids in evolution and re-emphasizing clinical infection control inspired by @di$ CRE @/di$.	1
Our work is the first to consider the DPP-4-like activity of the gut microbiota as a potential target of DPP-4 inhibitors and evaluate, in an animal model of diet-induced @di$ obesity @/di$, the effect of vildagliptin on gut barrier function, innate immune response and liver. Overall, our results show that vildagliptin improved gastrointestinal function judged by restoration of the expression of AMPs and the depth of the crypts in the ileum. In the liver, vildagliptin was associated with a reduction of cytokine expression. However, the ex vivo experiment with PCLS showed that reductions were not due to a direct effect of the drug, reinforcing the idea that reduced hepatic inflammatory tone might be related to changes at the intestinal level. Furthermore, vildagliptin was associated with changes in beta diversity indexes, reductions in @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$ spp. and increases in Lactobacillus spp. and caecal propionate levels. Among the 67 OTUs changed by vildagliptin, we can pinpoint some unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, as well as P. goldsteinii, as potential contributors to the increase in propionate levels, even if no statistically significant correlation backed up this fact. DPP-4 is a multifunctional protein and therefore it is plausible that its inhibition by vildagliptin has induced the broad changes that we observed through several mechanisms. In this regard, we demonstrated three effects of vildagliptin on the intestine, namely: (1) restoration of the active form of gut peptides such as GLP-1; (2) modulation of the innate immune response; and (3) modulation of the gut microbiota. There could be a link between these effects, as illustrated for instance in a study performed in @di$ obese @/di$ prebiotic-fed mice which reported that the gut microbiota influenced the release of substrates of DPP-4 such as GLP-1 and GLP-2.	2
Out-bred mice weighing 15-20 g after intraperitoneal introduction of TcT @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ at a dose of 20 mug developed toxinemia with the appearance of general tremor, convulsions, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, prostration and death of animals within 15-22 hours from the start of the experiment. A morphological study showed that this toxin causes a pronounced multi-organ pathology with a predominance of degenerative-destructive changes. An assumption was made that the formation of typical granulomas was due to the direct damaging effect of TcT on target organs. Ultrastructural studies have confirmed the membranolytic effect of this toxin on the cells of the parenchymal organs. Finally, it was recently established that some isolates of @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ produce a cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNFY), but the functional consequences of this toxin on host-pathogen interactions during infection are little known. The presence of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor gene (cnfY) was detected in all 104 studied @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ strains isolated in the Russian Federation in 1966-2015 from patients with FESLF, from rodents, and from environmental objects.	1
"Over 70% of the respondents thought they have been affected by ""food poisoning"" at some time, and 70% thought that they should seek medical help when they have had one or more symptoms of the following: abdominal pain, diarrhea (bloody or not), vomiting, mild fever, @di$ weakness @/di$, nausea +-4.9 h, headaches, and males were more likely than females to visit a doctor (82% vs. 47%). The respondents thought that restaurants are the main cause of foodborne disease (36%), but 27% stated carelessness, 11% thought it was contaminated food, and only 3% considered bacteria. The educational level did not seem to be a big factor in this knowledge, e.g., those only with primary schooling (10) selected restaurants (8) or bacteria (2); and those with high school or university levels (85) had no idea (22), selected restaurants (28) or contaminated food (24), or carelessness (10), but only 1 selected bacteria. Interestingly, although 23% claimed they had no idea what was the cause of ""food poisoning"", many men and women had heard of Bacillus (31%), @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ (16%), Clostridium (26%), E."	0
Over the course of chronic SIV infection and long-term ART, however, the specific loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Treponema succinifaciens @/gm$ significantly correlated with an increase in plasma inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, G-CSF, I-TAC, and MIG. Further, the loss of @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ correlated with an increase in circulating biomarkers of gut epithelial barrier damage (IFABP) and microbial translocation (LBP and sCD14). As F. prausnitzii and @gm$ T. succinifaciens @/gm$ are major short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, their sustained loss during chronic SV-ART may contribute to gut inflammation and metabolic alterations despite effective long-term control of @di$ viremia @/di$.	1
Over the past few years, several important @di$ oral pathogens @/di$ have been completely or partially sequenced [for a review see ]. Table 1 provides an updated list of the current genomics tools and databases available for @di$ oral pathogens @/di$. While many of these databases and tools provide useful and unique information regarding the same genomes, difficulties are often encountered when users try to compare or combine information available for the same genes. For example, at least two independently annotated databases are currently available for the genomes of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$, i.e. in The Comprehensive Microbial Resource of The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR CMR) and the @di$ Oral @/di$ Pathogen Sequence Databases of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), respectively (also refer to Table 1). Discrepancies occur when different criteria were used in either gene identification, naming or functional annotation. Table 2 shows the different numbers of genes present in various annotation sources for the genome of P.gingivalis. While these independently maintained databases provide useful and unique information and tools, they also present to users a great challenge for comparing and integrating the information for the same genes from these multiple sources. The Bioinformatics Resource For @di$ Oral Pathogens @/di$ (BROP) is a web-base resource center providing bioinformatics tools and databases for @di$ oral pathogens @/di$ with the primary goal of presenting integrated information for the same genome from multiple sources of data.	0
Overall, 949 @di$ LOS infections @/di$ were identified, corresponding to an overall incidence of 16.9 episodes per 1000 live births. GNB were isolated in 43% of cases, with the most common isolates being Klebsiella spp. (44% of GNB), @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ spp.	1
Overall, our findings were largely comparable to those of previous studies, indicating that species such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Filifactor alocis, Treponema socranskii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$, and Mycoplasma faucium were significantly enriched in samples from patients with @di$ periodontitis @/di$.	1
"Overall, samples from patients with CeD appeared to have a decreased abundance of Actinobacteria phylum that is mainly represented by bacteria belonging to the @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus. Many Bifidobacteria have positive immunomodulatory functions and are therefore used as probiotics. However, the increased abundance of L. acidophilus and Coprococcus species in in children with CeD contrasts with previous reports description as ""good bacteria"". Samples from non-CeD controls appeared to have an increased abundance of ""beneficial"" bacteria (decreased in CeD) such as Roseburia and Lachnospiraceae species. Roseburia species are short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, which modulate intestinal motility and have anti-inflammatory properties. Changes in Roseburia species abundance have been correlated to several diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, @di$ obesity @/di$, and type 2 diabetes."	2
"Overall, the clinical presentation was not ""atypical"" (i.e., lacking the ""classical"" clinical symptoms of fever, @di$ headache @/di$ and a decreased level of consciousness) and the vast majority of patients had pneumococcal meningitis (67%). Other causative organisms were @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ (13%), group B streptococci (4%), and Escherichia coli (2%)."	1
Overall, the reduced secondary bile acids and related decreased gene expression demonstrated altered bile acid biotransformation in the Bacteroides-, Eubacterium- and Ruminococcaceae-depleted microbiota of children with @di$ NAFLD @/di$. Furthermore, these results might indicate elevated serum concentrations of bile acids or the presence of intrahepatic cholestasis, although the concentrations of serum total bile acid from clinical data showed no statistical difference between the two groups. However, our assumption might be in accordance with previously reported elevated serum concentrations of secondary bile acids in patients with @di$ NAFLD @/di$. Interestingly, in our study, we also found that the predicted gene abundance for secondary bile acid biosynthesis (KEGG orthology ko00121) was higher in children with @di$ NAFLD @/di$ than in healthy children, which may be related to the increased level of the secondary bile acid CDCA-3Gln. Correlation analysis revealed that the concentrations of secondary bile acid LCA were positively correlated with the abundance of the species Eubacterium sp. OM08_24 and @gm$ R. bicirculans @/gm$, but negatively correlated with the potentially pathogenic E. coli. These data suggest that Eubacterium- and Ruminococcus-depleted gut microbiota along with imbalanced bile acid-transforming activity in children with @di$ NAFLD @/di$ seemed more likely to influence the level of fecal LCA. Decreased abundance of the fecal Eubacterium and Ruminococcus genus in children with @di$ NAFLD @/di$ indicated lower deconjugating activity and 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity, eventually contributing to the reduced level of LCA.	2
Overexpression of APP led to Abeta accumulation and was related to @di$ AD @/di$ occurrence. Recently, @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ NS8 has been found to improve behavioral, cognitive and biochemical aberrations, and L. fermentum NS9 has been indicated to restores physiological and psychological abnormalities. Moreover, Bifidobacterium longum 1714 has also been evaluated for the potential of protecting against @di$ Alzheimer's disease @/di$.	2
Oxidative stress and injury are closely related to accelerated aging and the development of a variety of systemic and metabolic diseases in the body, such as cancer, diabetes, @di$ hypertension @/di$, and atherosclerosis. Since the health is growing important and receiving increasing attention, antioxidant studies are prominent in fields like Food Science, Medicine, and Life science. There are some studies reporting that @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ with antioxidant activity helps improve the antioxidant function of fermented products. Additionally, research believed the application of fermenter YK provides a new functional food, which can decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease caused by oxidative stress. evaluated the antioxidant capacity of Black Gamju extract fermented by @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ by ABTS radical scavenging assay and beta-carotene bleaching assay, and found that ABTS radical scavenging effect was significant. Huang et al., (2020) found that @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ B49 alleviated oxidative stress in constipated mice by reducing serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. found @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ PP04 effectively improved oxidative stress induced by high-fat diet by activating Nrf2/CYP2E1 signaling pathway.	2
P80 administration caused similar alterations to human gut microbiomes as @di$ IBD @/di$, resulting in a reduction of the beneficial @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus, important SCFAs producers such as Faecalibacterium and Subdoligranulum genera, as well as Clostridium leptum. Naimi et al., treated the fecal samples from a healthy participant with different emulsifiers in the MiniBioReactor Array model ex vivo, and they found the altered bacterial beta-diversity after treatment with P80, with the lower growth of Streptococcus and Faecalibacterium. In mice, an intake of P80 exacerbated indomethacin-induced ileitis, decreasing the alpha-diversity of intestinal microbiota. The growth of the sulphide producers including Enterobacteriacaeae and the swarming behavior of @di$ IBD @/di$-related species Proteus mirabilis were significantly promoted. Swarming is a type of flagella-mediated movement that is a multicellular process and requires the differentiation of vegetative cells into a specialized cell type called a swarmer cell. The swarming ability of Proteus mirabilis is highly related to its pathogenesis in @di$ IBD @/di$.	1
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a long-term molecular study of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD), the tentative CGD patients presenting with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced infection, refractory atypical @di$ mycobacterial cutaneous granuloma and osteomyelitis @/di$, recurrent salmonella sepsis, and pneumatocele were studied for the IL-12/23-IFN-gamma circuit. ROS was first measured to exclude CGD. Candidate genes of IL12RB1, IFNRG1, IL12p40, IFNRG2, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and NF-kappaB essential modulator and their encoding protein expressions were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 175 Taiwanese PIDD patients during a 28-year period, three patients from two unrelated families were identified with the hotspot INFRG1 deletion mutation (818del4) and had CGD features, presenting as cutaneous granuloma, and multiple @di$ osteomyelitis infected @/di$ by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, Mycobacteria avium complex and @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$.	1
PEA192, @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, and Flavonifractor plautii belonging to the family Oscillospiraceae were positively correlated with C12:0. Oscillospiraceae is a gram-positive bacterium, which can not only ferment complex plant carbohydrates to produce butanoic acid but also makes use of gluconate. Previous studies have found that butyric-producing bacteria have a long-term intervention in @di$ obesity @/di$, and have shown beneficial effects on host glucose, lipid metabolism, and gut microbial composition.	2
PID was defined as 1) histologic endometritis or 2) @di$ pelvic pain and tenderness @/di$ plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees C, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. Exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. The first correlated with BV by Gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, @gm$ Gardnerella vaginalis @/gm$, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to a lesser degree, Ureaplasma urealyticum.	1
PURPOSE: @di$ Obesity @/di$ is a major risk factor for various metabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) impairment has been proposed as a mechanism of fat accumulation and glucose tolerance. Our aims were to determine the role of intestinal epithelial glut1 activity in @di$ obesity @/di$ and the mechanism of anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effect of Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LCZ) intervention in the absence of gut villi-specific glut1 expression. METHODS: This study compared the body weight, intestinal microbiota perturbations, fat mass accumulation, and glucose tolerance (by oral glucose tolerance test) between high-fat diet fed villi-specific glut1 knockout (KO) mice and control mice (glut1 flox/flox) with/without LCZ intervention. The intestinal microbiota was evaluated by metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Our results showed that villi-specific glut1 KO mice had more fat deposition at the premetaphase stage, impaired glucose tolerance, and obvious alterations in gut microbiota compared to control mice. Probiotic administration significantly lowered the body weight, the weights of mesenteric and perirenal white adipose tissues (WAT), and mediated gut microbiota modulation in both types of KO and control mice. The species @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$ and Faecalibaculum rodentium might contribute to fasting fat mass accumulation associated with gut-specific glut1 inactivation, while the probiotic-mediated anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effect was linked to members of the Bacteroides genera, Odoribacter genera and Alistipes finegoldii. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that abrogating gut epithelial GLUT1 activity affected the gut microbiota, fat mass accumulation, and glucose tolerance; and LCZ administration reduced fat mass accumulation and central @di$ obesity @/di$.	2
PURPOSE: The case of a diabetic foot infection caused by @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ is reported. SUMMARY: A 68-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the hospital with a fever (38.5  C) and a foul-smelling @di$ pressure ulcer @/di$ on his left foot and was admitted for treatment of a moderate diabetic foot infection. The patient's medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, cataract surgery, and total hip arthroplasty. A tissue biopsy of the diabetic foot lesion was performed, and a blood sample was cultured. Empirical antimicrobial treatment consisting of amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2 g (of amoxicillin) i.v. every 12 hours and ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours was initiated to target aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms. After 48 hours, the results of the blood culture were negative, but the left ankle wound culture grew @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$. Although the isolated @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ was relatively sensitive, showing resistance only to cefazolin and ampicillin, the antibiotic regimen was not changed. The patient showed clinical and laboratory improvement during his 5-day hospitalization. Subsequently, i.v. antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient was discharged on oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g (of amoxicillin) twice daily and oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily for an additional 9 days to complete a total duration of 14 days of treatment, after which the infection was completely resolved. CONCLUSION: A 68-year-old man diagnosed with a diabetic foot infection caused by @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ was successfully treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin.	1
PURPOSE: To describes one case of syphilitic @di$ necrotizing retinitis @/di$ and one case of presumed syphilitic @di$ necrotizing retinitis @/di$ with presence of subhyaloid hypopyon. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report two cases of @di$ necrotizing retinitis @/di$, which were noted to have yellow boat-shaped lesions at the inferior edge of @di$ retinitis @/di$ resembling subhyaloid hypopyon. The subhyaloid location was confirmed on optical coherence tomography in one case. Both the cases were positive for venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) and @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ hemagglutination (TPHA). But in one case, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the aqueous humor was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and responded well to piperacillin. As piperacillin is effective against Pseudomonas and the efficacy of piperacillin in the management of syphilis is not studied, we may have to consider it as a case of presumed @di$ syphilitic retinitis @/di$. DISCUSSION: Subhyaloid hypopyon is an uncommon presentation and is reported in two cases of syphilitic @di$ necrotizing retinitis @/di$ in literature. Severe infection and necrosis confined to the inner retina leads to collection of white blood cells and necrotic material in the subhyaloid space and would settle down resulting in subhyaloid hypopyon. Two cases of subhyaloid hypopyon reported in literature and 2 cases reported in our article are @di$ syphilitic retinitis @/di$ and is not reported in other entities. CONCLUSION: It is possible that subhyaloid hypopyon may serve as a diagnostic cue in syphilitic @di$ necrotizing retinitis @/di$.	1
PURPOSE: To report a case of endophthalmitis caused by @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$. METHODS: A 33-year-old man sustained a penetrating injury of the right eye that resulted in several ocular surgical procedures including pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, scleral-sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens, and penetrating keratoplasty. More than 4 years after the penetrating injury he presented for examination with pain, photophobia, redness, decreased vision, and @di$ floaters @/di$ in the right eye. Vitreous culture grew @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$. RESULTS: Following intravitreal injection of antibiotics, the patient's vision improved from 3/200 to 20/80 (baseline visual acuity) within 2 days. All signs of inflammation resolved without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium sordellii endophthalmitis may have a more benign course than the fulminant endophthalmitis typically seen with other @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ species.	1
PURPOSE: To report a case of unusual ulcer morphology in orthokeratology-related @di$ corneal ulcer @/di$. METHODS: A single observational case report of a 14-year-old Chinese female myope with a 1.5-month experience wearing overnight B.E. orthokeratology (Capricornia) lenses and presenting with a right stellate-shaped central cornea abscess. Cornea scrapings for Gram stains, culture, and antibiotic sensitivity were performed. The patient was prescribed hourly fortified cefazolin and gentamicin drops. RESULTS: @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$ grew on blood and chocolate agar cultures.	1
PURPOSE: We examined the effects of the immunosuppressive neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on rat endotoxin-induced uveitis, and to measure the expression of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines and chemokines with and without the alpha-MSH treatment over the course of the disease. METHODS: We injected Lewis rats once with @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce uveitis. The rats were given intravenous injections of 250, 500 or 1000 microg of alpha-MSH. The eyes were examined over the next 24 h for @di$ inflammation @/di$. Aqueous humor was collected 6, 12 and 24 h after endotoxin injections and the number of infiltrating cells were counted in anterior chamber. In addition, we assayed the concentration of protein, nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-2. RESULTS: Rats injected with alpha-MSH showed a significant decrease in the number of infiltrating cells in anterior chamber. Moreover, alpha-MSH-treated rats with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) showed significantly lower concentrations of protein, nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their aqueous humor. Even the early stages of EIU were suppressed by the injection of alpha-MSH. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the immunosuppressive neuropeptide alpha-MSH inhibits the early induction events of endotoxin-induced @di$ inflammation @/di$ in the eye; therefore, suppresses the subsequent infiltration of cells and intraocular production of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines and chemokines in eyes.	1
PWAS was further performed on 65 @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ strains to identify any accessory gene in this serogroup that might be associated with @di$ HUS @/di$. Pangenomes of 65 @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ strains consisted of 6,608 genes. Scoary identified a number of accessory genes among @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ strains that were significantly overrepresented in strains from @di$ HUS @/di$ patients (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p < 0.05) (Supplementary Table S4); however, most of these genes were related to hypothetical proteins whose function remain to be characterized. MCA of pangenomes showed that @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ strains from @di$ HUS @/di$ patients, mostly belonging to clade 8, clustered closely, while strains from non-@di$ HUS @/di$ patients were discretely distributed (Fig.	1
Paleo-genomic studies also provided unambiguous evidence confirming the presence of @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ in two historically recorded plague pandemics: the Justinian's Plague (6-8th centuries) and the second plague pandemic (14-18th centuries) including the infamous Black Death. The phylogenetic reconstruction of Justinian's Plague aDNA revealed novel, extinct Justinian lineages (0.ANT4 and 0.ANT5) that branched between current 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2 lineages, inaugurating independent lineages from strains associated with subsequent pandemics. The wide distribution of @di$ 0.ANT @/di$ strains (0.ANT3 and the newly found 0.ANT5 population) within the high-mountain foci from Kyrgyzstan suggests a Central Asian origin for the Justinian's Plague pandemic.	1
Parabacteroides distasonis MRx0005 and @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ MRx0029 had the strongest capacity to reduce IL-6 secretion in vitro. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and both bacterial strains displayed intrinsic antioxidant capacity. While MRx0005 showed a general antioxidant activity on different brain cell lines, MRx0029 only protected differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. MRx0029 also induced a mature phenotype in undifferentiated @di$ neuroblastoma @/di$ cells through upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 2. Interestingly, short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that MRx0005 mainly produced C1-C3 fatty acids, while MRx0029 produced C4-C6 fatty acids, specifically butyric, valeric and hexanoic acid. None of the short-chain fatty acids tested protected @di$ neuroblastoma @/di$ cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. However, butyrate was able to reduce neuroinflammation in vitro, and the combination of butyrate and valerate induced neuronal maturation, albeit not to the same degree as the complex cell-free supernatant of MRx0029. This observation was confirmed by solvent extraction of cell-free supernatants, where only MRx0029 methanolic fractions containing butyrate and valerate showed an anti-inflammatory activity in U373 cells and retained the ability to differentiate @di$ neuroblastoma @/di$ cells.	2
Parasite spillover from invasive aliens to native species increases the risk of disease emergence within native biota-either by direct harm to the new host or by indirect effects like increased risks of secondary @di$ infection @/di$. One example for such a detrimental effect is the parasitic copepod Mytilicola intestinalis that infected blue mussels Mytilus edulis after being introduced into the North Sea in the early 20th century. Since 1949, the parasite was blamed for multiple mass mortalities of infested blue mussels but evidence for a direct causal involvement of @gm$ M. intestinalis @/gm$ remained circumstantial. Here, we now examine the potential effects of primary infections by the invasive parasite on the susceptibility to secondary infections with virulent bacteria (Vibrio spp.) in a full factorial @di$ infection @/di$ experiment combining parasite @di$ infection @/di$ (control vs. infected) with different Vibrio infection treatments (control, bath challenge, injection) in environmental conditions that either favoured the host (ambient temperature) or the bacterium (elevated temperature). The influence of primary and secondary infections on cellular immunity (phagocytosis) and Vibrio load in the haemolymph was used to correlate these results to host survival. Our results suggest that the rate of secondary Vibrio infection is increased due to lower efficiency of the cellular immune response. As a consequence, the failure of clearing Vibrio from the haemolymph might increase mortality of mussels infected by @gm$ M. intestinalis @/gm$. This demonstrates that indirect effects of parasite invasions can outweigh direct effects of the @di$ infection @/di$ highlighting the need for a more integrative approach to understand and predict the consequences of parasite invasions.	1
Paratyphi A and @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ (500 million each/ml) (TAB) had reasonable protection level but had severe reactogenecity. Individuals administered with TAB complained about headache, @di$ fever @/di$, malaise and localized tenderness at the injection site.	1
Paratyphi A and @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ carriage also appear to contribute to gallbladder carcinogenesis. A previous study in Chile isolated S. Paratyphi A in 1.5% of 1000 bile samples and @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ in 8.8%, accounting for 6.8% and 41.1% of all Salmonella species isolated 52. In addition, Caygill et al. reported that their cohort of chronic Salmonella carriers included 61 S. Paratyphi A, B, or C carriers, 21 S. Typhi carriers, and one carrier with both S. Paratyphi and S. Typhi, although they did not describe the serotypes of the five GBC cases that developed among these carriers 10. Singh et al. reported one S. Paratyphi carrier and four S. Typhi carriers out of 38 GBC cases (2.6% and 10.5%, respectively) 30. Finally Nath et al. reported that 3.5% of 28 GBC cases had S. Paratyphi A and 10.7% had S. Typhi, while the corresponding figures were 0% and 1.8% among the 56 @di$ gallstone @/di$ controls 27.	1
Paratyphi A and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ were only found in aac (6')-Ib-cr4 and qnrS1, respectively, and both of them were @di$ MDR @/di$. Among all 30 S. Paratyphi B isolates, 11 strains contained PMQR genes including qnrS1 (n = 7), aac (6')-Ib-cr4 (n = 4), qnrB4 (n = 2), qnrA1 (n = 2) and qnrD1 (n = 1). None of the isolates were positive for qnrC and qepA. The five strains carrying the aac (6')-Ib-cr4 gene were all @di$ MDR @/di$ and had reduced susceptibility to quinolones.	1
Paratyphi A infection include fever, @di$ headache @/di$, diarrhoea or constipation, malaise, anorexia, nausea, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, chills, raised spots or rashes on body. Overall, the cytokine profile of @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ infection is similar to S.	1
Paratyphi A organisms (n = 39); Group II- patients with clinical characteristics compatible with enteric fever, but in whom blood cultures remained negative (n = 204); Group III- patients confirmed by relevant methods to have other illnesses (n = 32; dengue (n = 15), leptospirosis (n = 1), @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ bacteremia (n = 1), tuberculosis (n = 7), visceral leishmaniasis (n = 5), respiratory tract infection (n = 1), acute hepatitis B infection (n = 1) and acute hepatitis E virus (n = 1) @di$ infection @/di$.	0
Paratyphi B, and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$, and another is gastroenteritis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serotypes such as S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. Salmonella can cause symptomatic infections, which is defined as the occurrence of any number of watery stools during 24 h period accompanied by fever, @di$ vomiting @/di$ or abdominal cramps.	1
Paratyphi B, and one with @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$. Of 1645 isolates with a recorded specimen type, 1213 (74 %) were from blood, 407 (25 %) from faeces, and 25 (2 %) from other specimen types (such as urine or abdominal fluid). Of all 1910 cases of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A and B, 1781 (93 %) had a clear history of recent travel, and a further 19 (1 %) had not travelled themselves but had a clear link to a recent traveller, with presumed transmission of the @di$ infection @/di$ in England.	1
Paratyphi C were only found in aac (6')-Ib-cr4 and qnrS1, respectively, and both of them were @di$ MDR @/di$. Among all 30 @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolates, 11 strains contained PMQR genes including qnrS1 (n = 7), aac (6')-Ib-cr4 (n = 4), qnrB4 (n = 2), qnrA1 (n = 2) and qnrD1 (n = 1). None of the isolates were positive for qnrC and qepA. The five strains carrying the aac (6')-Ib-cr4 gene were all @di$ MDR @/di$ and had reduced susceptibility to quinolones. In addition, 5 strains of @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ with a single point mutation in qnrS1 were susceptible to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.	1
Paratyphi, and @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$. The clinical symptoms that are most common in Diarrheal patients infected by Salmonella species include fever, @di$ vomiting @/di$, nausea, abdominal pains, and in some cases bloody stool.	1
Participants in routine health check-ups of the healthcare system were screened for serological evidence of syphilis by the @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ particle agglutination (TPPA) test. Lumbar puncture was performed, with consent, on untreated latent syphilitic patients. Neurosyphilis was defined as positivity for cerebrospinal fluid Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (CSF VDRL) or @di$ pleocytosis @/di$ with positivity for CSF TPPA or elevation of CSF protein with IgG index exceeding 0.85.	1
Participants in the @di$ WLD @/di$ group were divided into three subgroups based on their initial abundance of significantly altered taxa: not detected, low, and high abundance groups (ND, HAG, and LAG, respectively). This analysis revealed that changes in bacterial levels depend on starting levels which means that bacteria in the LAG group increased more than in the HAG group. For example, abundances of Porphyromonadaceae, Rikenellaceae (Alistipes), Butyricimonas, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Ruminococcus_1, and Odoribacter splanchnicus were significantly increased after @di$ WLD @/di$ in the LAG group compared to insignificant changes in the HAG group (Figure A6). In the case of bacteria, which decreased after @di$ WLD @/di$, reduction of Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$, and both Dorea species was significant in the HAG group, while significant changes were not observed in the LAG group (Figure A6).	2
Patients who reported long-term smoking, were associated with higher abundance of @gm$ Campylobacter concisus @/gm$ (P < 0.05) and lower abundance of Streptococcus thermophilus (P < 0.01) and Dorea longicatena (P < 0.05). Five species, such as Dorea longicatena and Streptococcus parasanguinis (P < 0.001), were reduced in patients with a long history of drinking. Collinsella intestinalis was inversely related to lung adenocarcinoma (P < 0.05), while it presented at a higher abundance in patients with @di$ small cell lung cancer @/di$ (P < 0.05).	1
Patients with IIM with a pathogenic co-infection typically demonstrated a number of the following characteristics: Long-term glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant treatments; also suffering from diabetes, chronic viral hepatitis or kidney disease; interstitial lung disease causing pulmonary infection; damage in respiratory muscles, leading to increased difficulty removing secretions and resulting in @di$ ventilatory disorders @/di$; damage in the gastrointestinal muscles, resulting in dysphagia and pulmonary aspiration defects; and decubitus ulcers and delayed healing, secondary to nutritional deficiencies and being bedridden. The most common bacteria causing infections in IIM cases included @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp.	1
Patients with a leukemoid reaction caused by bacteria are most commonly infected with the bacillus bacteria, typically seen in seniors with a @di$ tumour @/di$. Whereas in young females undergoing vaginal surgery, @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ is commonly found, which usually causes necrotizing soft tissue infections and severe clinical symptoms, such as shock. The patient in the present case report underwent induced labour and gynaecological surgery, which was nearly fatal, but the bacteria causing her severe infection was determined to be E. coli. Vaginal infection complicated by leukemoid reaction is very rare. In two previously reported cases of vaginal infections complicated by leukemoid reaction, the WBC counts were 42 900 cells/microl and 64 030 cells/microl, respectively, and the associated pathogens were Gram positive and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$.	1
Patients with iron overload from @di$ hemochromatosis @/di$ are more susceptible to infections with Yersinia, @gm$ Listeria @/gm$, Vibrio, and Mycobacterium.	1
Patients with the related factors of travel abroad, positive results of a test for @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ hemagglutination, and homosexuality have increased in number in recent years. Fever, @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, and hepatomegaly were the most frequent findings, and 39 patients had neither bloody stools nor diarrhea.	0
Pectin fermentations affected abundances of various bacterial taxa associated with microbiota dysbiosis in human diseases, such as @di$ obesity @/di$ and IBD. Thus, it was previously shown that @di$ obesity @/di$-related bias in the gut microbiota included higher levels of Blautia, Eubacterium, Roseburia, Dorea and Ruminococcus, along with reduction of F. prausnitzii, Oscillospira, Christensenellaceae, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, Bacteroides and genera within Proteobacteria. Besides, R. torques and R. gnavus, decreased in this study, were found in higher numbers in IBD patients. Notably, shifts in F. prausnitzii, Coprococcus, B. ovatus, B. plebeius, @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ and Sutterella were strongly dependent on the feed, suggesting that these species can be modulated by specific pectins. Among them, F. prausnitzii, is commonly referred to as a marker for intestinal health, exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects in the gut. This study indicated that stimulation of F. prausnitzii could be achieved by fermentation of high methoxyl pectins (P1-P3) rather than LM pectins (P7 and P8). In their turn, LM citrus pectins were efficient to decrease proportions of @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, a microbe associated with induced insulin resistance in mice and rheumatoid arthritis in humans; and to increase the levels of Coprococcus linked to reduced severity of IBS in humans.	2
Periodontitis is an infectious and inflammatory disorder that is characterized by the destruction of the supporting structure of teeth, induced by biofilm dysbiosis, in which a higher proportion of major pathogens such as red complex species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$, and a low proportion of beneficial strains, such as Actinomyces sp. or Streptococcus sp., remain the key to microbial disruption. Despite improvements in preventive measures over the past 40 years, periodontal disease continues to contribute to widespread oral health dysfunction and an increased susceptibility to systemic diseases. Chronic unresolved hyperinflammation during periodontal disease is strongly associated with systemic conditions such as @di$ diabetes @/di$ and obesity, and cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and is caused by the dysbiosis of the oral microbiome; therefore, major periodontal pathogens may be the targets of therapeutic interventions, as has recently been reported in the literature.	1
Periodontitis is defined as chronic @di$ inflammation @/di$ of tooth supporting tissues. Healthy periodontium maintain host-microbe homeostasis in which a controlled immuno-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ state is kept. Imbalanced host-microbe interaction lead to disease initiation and progression (Cheng et al.,). Several Gram-negative anaerobic and microaerophilic bacterial species, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and the corresponding host responses, are the predominant etiological factors of periodontitis (Kinane,). Pathological bacteria are significant @di$ inflammatory @/di$ stimulus that triggers various cell types (epithelial cells, periodontal ligament fibroblasts, leukocytes, osteoblasts) to release pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ factors, e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), proteases, matrix metalloproteinases, prostaglandins (PGE), and so on Trindade et al.. These @di$ inflammatory @/di$ molecules lead to the breakdown of connective tissue and bone (Di Benedetto et al.,).	1
Periodontitis is mostly caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, and Bacteroides forsythus. Recent reports have suggested the association of periodontitis with systemic diseases including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), @di$ hypertension @/di$ and inflammatory bowel disease.	0
Persistent @di$ diarrhea @/di$ is an episode of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ that begins acutely but lasts longer than expected for this usually self-limited disease. Treatment of this ill-defined syndrome is not well standardized but immediate intervention is required to minimize the risk of malnutrition with its various consequences. This randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk, as the only treatment. After a one to two-day observation period during which a standard milk diet was given, 78 children aged 3 to 36 months with confirmed persistent @di$ diarrhea @/di$ of more than 15 days but less than one month duration and negative tests for fecal blood were fed either milk (infant formula) or yogurt (infant formula fermented with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$). At inclusion both groups were comparable for age, nutritional status, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, and lactose hydrogen breath test results. Clinical treatment failure (weight loss greater than 5% in one day or persistent @di$ diarrhea @/di$ after 5 days) was significantly less common in children fed yogurt (15 +/- 6%) than in children fed milk (45 +/- 8%). The beneficial effects of feeding yogurt were apparent within 48 hours in 67 +/- 8% of infants. In conclusion, these data confirm the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk in young children with persistent @di$ diarrhea @/di$. They also suggest that yogurt may be a good alternative for the initial treatment of persistent @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	2
Persisting symptoms were reported by 80% of patients and included cough, fatigue, chest tightness after activity, and @di$ myalgia @/di$. The results confirmed significant alterations in fecal microbiota compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, F. prausnitzii was negatively correlated with chest tightness after activity (r = -0.591, p = 0.02), @gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$ negatively correlated with cough (r = -0.635, p = 0.011), and unclassified Escherichia positively correlated with fatigue (r = 0.567, p = 0.028), chest tightness after activity (r = 0.687, p = 0.005), and @di$ myalgia @/di$ (r = 0.523, p = 0.045), while Intestinibacter bartlettii was positively correlated with anorexia (r = 0.629, p = 0.012) and fatigue (r = 0.545, p = 0.036). Despite the low sample size, which did not allow a direct comparison between patients with or without PCS, this study was the first to analyze the relationship between different microbial species and specific PCS symptoms, suggesting, for example, the association between the reduction in BPB (e.g., F. prausnitzii, @gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$) and the persistence of respiratory symptoms such as cough and chest tightness after activity.	2
Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences were 99% similar, and clustered within the genus as a novel group which was termed @di$ HS @/di$ (@di$ HS @/di$ = healthy subject). A PCR primer pair specific for the HS group was designed from the sequence data and used to reexamine the original samples. Although it was not possible to culture the organism from faeces, specific PCR assay detected it in 10 of the 20 faecal samples, but not in any corresponding saliva samples. The authors propose that the source of the amplicons is a previously undescribed and so far uncultivated species, which they term 'Candidatus @gm$ Campylobacter hominis @/gm$'.	0
Platelet activation was also induced by exposure to heat-killed @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$, which indicated that it was not dependent on bacterial viability and suggests that it was elicited by a structural bacterial component. Our laboratory has been investigating for years the role of lipoproteins in @di$ inflammation @/di$ generated by Brucella. We have described that Brucella LPS does not produce cellular activation, however, Brucella lipoproteins produce activation of several cell types. Thus, we hypothesized that @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ lipoproteins might be the structural components involved in the observed phenomenon. L-Omp19, a prototypical @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ lipoprotein, recapitulated platelet stimulation and concomitant HBMEC activation. Acylation of Omp19 was required for its biological activity since U-Omp19 had no effect on platelet stimulation. The genome of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ possesses no less than 80 genes encoding putative lipoproteins, and many of them are expressed in the outer membrane of the bacterium. In this context, we posit that any surface-exposed Brucella lipoprotein may be significant beyond in vitro assays and not one lipoprotein but rather a combination of them may contribute to the platelet activation elicited by @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$.	1
Pneumonia was the most common infection due to @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$, and occurred only in patients with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube in place. In over half the 25 patients, more than one lobe was involved and bronchopneumonia was the usual roentgenographic appearance. Cavitation (2 patients) and empyema formation (3 patients) were uncommon. The severity of acinetobacter pneumonia is reflected in the high mortality rate (44% overall, with a 36% mortality rate due primarily to infection). Tracheobronchitis due to @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$ was less severe than pneumonia since no patients died primarily as a result of the infection. @di$ Urinary tract infections @/di$ occurred in five patients, none of whom were ill and none of whom died. Urinary bladder catheterization was thought to be responsible for infection in three patients, and in at least four of the five patients infection was restricted to the lower tract. Wound infections were noted in six patients who had undergone surgery and were related to the presence of foreign bodies in the operative site in five of the patients. Surgical debridement and/or drainage of the infected area was the primary therapeutic measure employed in most cases. Only one patient died and this was a result of noninfectious causes. Skin infection due to @gm$ A. calcoaceticus @/gm$ was seen in two patients, one of whom exhibited fulminant, fatal cellulitis and septicemia in the setting of pancytopenia.	1
Polyphenols are known for their anti-oxidant and anti-@di$ diabetic @/di$ role. Phytic acid, previously considered an anti-nutritive substance, is now regarded as a nutraceutical as it reduces carbohydrate digestibility and thus controls post-prandial glucose levels and obesity. Thus, finger millet is an attractive diet for patients with @di$ diabetes @/di$. Recent findings have revealed that the anti-oxidant activity and bio-accessibility of finger millet polyphenols increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the colon, confirming the role of the gut microbiota. The prebiotic content of finger millet was also utilized by the gut microbiota, such as Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, and Roseburia, to generate colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are known to be anti-@di$ diabetic @/di$ in nature. Notably, finger millet-induced mucus-degrading @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ can also help in alleviate @di$ diabetes @/di$ by releasing propionate and Amuc_1100 protein. Various millet bio-actives effectively controlled pathogenic gut microbiota, such as Shigella and Clostridium histolyticum, to lower gut inflammation and, thus, the risk of @di$ diabetes @/di$ in the host. In the current review, we have meticulously examined the role of gut microbiota in the bio-accessibility of millet compounds and their impact on @di$ diabetes @/di$.	2
Porphyromonas gingivalis may have a role in the development of periodontal diseases, oral cancer, diabetes, and @di$ atherosclerotic disease @/di$. Fusobacterium nucleatum showed a higher abundance in periodontal diseases, oral and colon cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The higher abundance of Prevotella intermedia is typical in periodontal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and adverse pregnancy outcome. @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ displayed higher abundance in both dental caries and OSCC.	0
Positive animals were culled and different tissues were cultured for the presence of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, with negative results. In addition, tissues of aborted fetuses in some farms were also tested for the presence of @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, all with negative results. Likewise, positive serological reactions were not detected in the feral pig population in the Cocos Island. Histopathological examination of the liver in the feral swine sample showed chronic @di$ inflammation @/di$ in 84% of the cases, while 20% had multifocal @di$ granulomatous inflammation @/di$ with eosinophilic infiltration, probably related to the presence of parasite nematode Stephanurus dentatus, but not @gm$ Brucella @/gm$.	0
Prebiotics such as FOS have been shown to increase butyrate production and promote growth of butyrate-producing bacteria such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$ Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Enterococcus. Recent studies have also shown their potential to reduce serum and total levels of uremic toxins such as p-cresyl sulfate in non-diabetic CKD patients. Resistant starch has been investigated with good success for its potential to reduce @di$ polyuria @/di$ and disruption of vitamin D homeostasis in Type 1 diabetic rats via rescue of renal megalin-mediated endocytosis.	2

Predisposing factors for brain abscess include the contiguous focus of infection (sinusitis or otitis media), hematogenous seeding (endocarditis, pulmonary, abdominal, or skin infection), penetrating @di$ head trauma @/di$ and neurosurgery. In addition, common pathogens of odontogenic infection comprise Streptococcus species (spp.), anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus spp. Of note, polymicrobial infection is common in brain abscess. In our case, S. sanguinis, F. nucleatum, and @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ were cultured from the specimen.	0
Preincubation of the uroepithelial cells with Lactobacillus bacterial cell wall fragments inhibited the adherence and colonization of gram-negative uropathogens either completely or partially, which prevented the onset of @di$ UTI @/di$ in female rats. Since the lipoteichoic acid present in the bacterial cell wall is responsible for the adherence of the Lactobacillus cells to uroepithelial cells but its steric hindrance blocked the adherence of uropathogens. Seven strains of lactic acid bacteria (L. paracasei, L. salivarius, two @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ strains, two L. plantarum strains, and L. crispatus) and their fermented probiotic products exhibited clear zones of inhibition against UPEC. This suggests their potential role in adjuvant therapy for prevention and treatment of @di$ UTI @/di$.	2
Presenting symptoms included respiratory distress, apnea, metabolic acidosis, @di$ fever @/di$, lethargy, abdominal distension, loose stools, congestion, poor feeding, and seizures. In five cases, further identification beyond S. gallolyticus was not performed. When classification was available, @gm$ S. pasteurianus @/gm$ was more common than S.	1
Prevalence of @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ in plaque samples of patients is listed in Table 4. After sequencing the amplified products of PCR using primers for Treponema sp., these primers were found to be inappropriate for the detection of T. denticola, since all the samples with amplified products were identified as @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ with 100% homology.	0
Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$ (@gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$), a major @di$ periodontal pathogen @/di$, enables the endothelial shedding and apoptosis while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) favors the shedding of splenocyte-derived microvesicles (SMVs). In vivo studies showed the feasibility of pharmacological control of SMV shedding. The present protocol establishes a standardized procedure for isolating splenic SMVs from the @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ acute murine infection model. P. gingivalis infection was induced in young C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection (three injections of 5 x 107 bacteria/week). After two weeks, the spleens were collected, weighed, and the splenocytes were counted. SMVs were isolated and quantified by protein, RNA, and prothrombinase assays. Cell viability was assessed by either propidium iodide or trypan blue exclusion dyes. Following splenocyte extraction, neutrophil counts were obtained by flow cytometry after 24 h of splenocyte culture. In @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-injected mice, a 2.5-fold increase in spleen weight and a 2.3-fold rise in the splenocyte count were observed, while the neutrophils count was enhanced by 40-folds. The cell viability of splenocytes from @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-injected mice ranged from 75%-96% and was decreased by 50% after 24 h of culture without any significant difference compared to unexposed controls.	1
Previous research has demonstrated that a probiotic mixture (Bifidobacterium brevis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and @gm$ Streptococcus thermophilus @/gm$) can ameliorate chemotherapy-induced mucositis and dysbiosis in rats, but the underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated. We aimed to determine the inhibitory effects of the probiotic mixture on cisplatin-induced mucositis and @di$ pica @/di$ and the underlying mechanism, focusing on the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) regulated by the gut microbiota. A rat model of mucositis and @di$ pica @/di$ was established by daily intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (6 mg/kg) for 3 days. In the probiotic+cisplatin group, predaily intragastric injection of the probiotic mixture (1 x 109 CFU/kg BW) was administrated for 1 week before cisplatin injection. This was then followed by further daily probiotic injections for 6 days. Histopathology, pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative status, and 5-HT levels were assessed on days 3 and 6. The structure of the gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Additionally, 5-HT levels in enterochromaffin (EC) cells (RIN-14B cell line) treated with cisplatin and/or various probiotic bacteria were also determined. The probiotic mixture significantly attenuated kaolin consumption, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the increase in 5-HT concentrations in rats with cisplatin-induced intestinal mucositis and @di$ pica @/di$.	2
Previous studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis divided most members of the genus Streptococcus into six distinct phylogenetic groups, namely the mitis, anginosus, pyogenic, bovis, mutans, and @gm$ salivarius @/gm$ group. The latter is composed of the oral and intestinal commensals S. vestibularis and @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ while S. thermophilus is essential for manufacturing dairy products and thus frequently consumed in high dosages. On the one hand, S. thermophilus and - to a lower extend - @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ (strains K12 and M18) are important probiotics. On the other hand, several studies have shown that @gm$ S. salivarius @/gm$ and S. vestibularis are opportunistic pathogens and can even be associated with life threating infections such as @di$ bacteremia @/di$, endocarditis and meningitis, the latter occurring mainly in immunocompromised patients.	1
Previous studies have evaluated the gut microbiota composition of @di$ thyroid cancer @/di$ patients and found a dominance of the genera Prevotella, Roseburia, Coprococcus, Anaerostipes, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Neisseria, Streptococcus, and Prophyromonas.	0
Previous studies have indicated changes in the diversity and composition of the vaginal microbiota in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women, especially overall bacteria levels and the decrease in @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ . Recently, two studies showed that the diversity and richness of the vaginal microbiota of @di$ POF @/di$ patients were statistically different from healthy controls. Wang et al. found that the relative abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ was significantly reduced in @di$ POF @/di$ patients and it is less abundant in postmenopausal women than in @di$ POF @/di$ patients. Wu et al. also found a significant decrease in @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in @di$ POI @/di$ patients with FSH > 40 IU/L.	2
Previous studies have shown that the SsPI-1 PAI is only present in the highly virulent Chinese @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ isolates, and might have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer, which may confer pathogenicity to the host strain. In the present work, we demonstrated that deletion of SsPI-1 significantly reduced bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and abolished the lethality of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ in a @di$ piglet infection @/di$ model. As well as causing fewer pathological lesions, the DeltaSsPI-1 mutant also has a decreased ability to elicit a host response to induce cytokine production. Taken together, these results provide supporting evidence of a vital role for SsPI-1 in the pathogenesis of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$.	1
Prevotella is part of the oral bacterial community implicated in @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Pan genome analyses of eight oral Prevotella species, @gm$ P. dentalis @/gm$, P.	1
Prevotella, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Propionibacterium were detected in more than 70% of all patients (Figure 1), while @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, F. nucleatum, P. acnes, S. capitis, and S. salivarius were detected in more than 50% of all patients (Figure 2). P. acnes was the dominant bacterium in 6 of 11 patients (Figure 3(b)). It is present on the skin, in the oral cavity, and the intestinal mucosa where it is known to be the causative agent of a wide range of diseases and opportunistic infections, including alveolar abscesses, maxillary sinusitis, @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, meningitis, noma, pericarditis, sepsis, hepatitis, granuloma, acne, and orbital abscesses. @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, which was detected in 7 patients (Figure 3(b)), is an indigenous oral bacterium that is primarily present in the buccal mucosa and on tooth surfaces.	1
Principal pathogens include @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, rotaviruses, and noroviruses. 90% of diarrhoeal deaths are attributable to inadequate sanitation. Acute diarrhoea is the second leading cause of overall childhood mortality and accounts for 18% of deaths among children under five. In 2004 an estimated 1.5 million children died from diarrhoea, with 80% of deaths occurring before the age of two. Treatment goals are to prevent dehydration and nutritional damage and to reduce duration and severity of @di$ diarrhoeal episodes @/di$. The recommended therapeutic regimen is to provide oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and to continue feeding. Although ORS effectively mitigates dehydration, it has no effect on the duration, severity, or frequency of @di$ diarrhoeal episodes @/di$.	1
Prior studies of the prevalence of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ colonization showed considerable differences, which might reflect true variation or technical issues. Studies in healthy adults suggest prevalence in the United States is between 31-38% but as high as 60-77% in Korea, Japan, and India. Such variation could also reflect medical practice differences, as @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ is known to be susceptible to many commonly prescribed antibiotics. In one prospective study, antibiotic treatment resulted in lasting suppression of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$. Patients with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ or inflammatory bowel disease, who receive multiple antibiotic courses also have lower @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ prevalence than controls. However, little is known about the transmission of @gm$ O. formigenes @/gm$ and its timing, and the factors influencing colonization.	1
Probing depth, @di$ bleeding @/di$ on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected and the FISH technique identified the presence and numbers of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$ and Prevotella nigrescens. The Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. The mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. The clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ in pregnant women.	0
Probiotic supplementation contributes to rectifying gut microbiota balance and alleviates @di$ IBD @/di$ symptoms through elevated SCFAs. Probiotic supplements also reduced inflammation. Intake of fermented vegetable beverages containing @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ led to improved loose stool symptoms associated with higher levels of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids.	2
Probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus pentosus WE7 was significantly associated with development of signs of @di$ depression @/di$, anorexia, and colic in foals. Also, supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$ led to increased diarrhoea in foals.	1
Probiotics have diverse health benefits including promoting good digestion, enhancing resistance to infection, improving the immune system, restoring and balancing the gut microflora, pathogen interference, as anti-carcinogenic and anti-mutagenic agents and ameliorating the effects of diseases such as diabetes and antibiotic-associated acute @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and constipation. Most probiotic microorganisms emanate from Lactobacillus (L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. gasseri, L. brevis, L. pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. coryniformis and L. johnsonii), Limosilactobacillus (L. fermentum and L. reuteri), Bifidobacterium (@gm$ B. animalis @/gm$, B.	2
Probiotics supplementation is associated with modulation of the gut microbiota to reduce the @di$ inflammation @/di$ cascade and enhance the immune system associated with liver surgery. Pediococcus pentoseceus, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, and Lactobacillus paracasei 19 inhibited bacterial translocations after liver resection in rats, and induced hepatocyte mitosis which was delayed by colonic anastomosis.	2
Proinflammatory Prevotella copri, associated with rheumatoid arthritis and microscopic @di$ colitis @/di$ as well as @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ and Klebsiella pneumoniae, pathogens commonly associated with hospital infections, were also enriched in H.	1
Promisingly, the HAM dietary intervention not only reduced body weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, and dyslipidemia but also mitigated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, @di$ impaired glucose tolerance @/di$, and inflammation in the liver and epididymal white adipose tissues in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice. In addition, the HAM dietary intervention ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice. Changes in families, genera, and species of gut biota that have a relative abundance of 0.01% in at least one group were scrutinized. At the species level, HAM dietary intervention increased Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum and decreased Streptococcus agalactiae, Mucispirillum schaedleri, and @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$.	2
Purpose: To describe a case with an unusual presentation of @gm$ Propionibacterium acnes @/gm$ (@gm$ P acnes @/gm$) with ultimately a good visual outcome. Methods: A case report with review of approaches to @gm$ P acnes @/gm$ endophthalmitis. Results: We describe a patient with an unusual presentation of @di$ P acnes of panuveitis @/di$ with white, circular preretinal lesions without intracapsular deposits. Diagnosis was made from cultures from pars plana vitrectomy. Eventually, she was definitively managed with capsulectomy, repositioning of her intraocular lens via sutureless intrascleral fixation, and intravitreal vancomycin injection. Conclusion: This is a report of @gm$ P acnes @/gm$ endophthalmitis presenting with discrete preretinal lesions where surgical and medical management lead to a complete resolution of uveitis and symptoms after a 3-year follow up where the patient's final visual acuity was Snellen 20/20 OU.	1
RATIONALE: Asymptomatic Paget disease of bone (PDB) is mostly diagnosed by accidental finding of @di$ osteolytic lesion @/di$ on the plain film. However, in elderly patient with chronic renal insufficiency and weight loss, it is crucial to differentiate PDB from metabolic and metastatic bone diseases for further treatment and better outcome. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 80-year-old man with chronic kidney disease presented to our emergency department due to fever with chillness for a day, while the abdominal fullness, anorexia, and weight loss had been noted for 3 months. Mixed osteoblastic and lytic changes in the pelvic bone were accidentally found on the abdominal plain film. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as asymptomatic PDB and urinary tract infection of @gm$ Pseudomonas aeruginosa @/gm$. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: The patient received 7 days intravenous and followed by 7 days oral antibiotic treatment, which lead to clinical improvement of his urinary tract infection. No pharmacological treatment was initiated for the asymptomatic and localized PDB. The patient was discharged under stable condition afterward. LESSONS: In patients with mixed @di$ osteolytic and @/di$ blastic lesions, the differential diagnoses include metabolic and metastatic bone disease.	0
RECENT FINDINGS: The Finnish study of Kalliomaki was the first report to describe that the frequency of @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ in neonates treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was half that of the placebo. Recently, these results have been questioned by two trials, which reported no difference in the development of @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ in neonates supplemented with LGG and @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$, respectively. In contrast, an unexpected increase in respiratory side-effects was observed in some studies in children who received the probiotics. Up to now no data have been released which report a positive effect of probiotics for the prevention of allergic rhinitis or asthma. Moreover, an allergen-preventive effect of probiotics for the development of @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ could not be consistently established.	0
RESULTS: A 52-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of diffuse dysesthesia in upper and lower extremities with associated intermittent @di$ headaches @/di$ and neck stiffness. Evaluation with lumbar puncture revealed increased nucleated cells (50ul) with lymphocytic predominance (96%) and an elevated protein level of 109mg/dl. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed T2/FLAIR hyper intensity in bilateral subcortical temporal white matter, left-greater-than-right and associated volume loss in cerebral parenchyma. Additional abnormal work up included reactive serum reactive plasma regain and @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ antibody particle agglutination. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis was made and the patient was treated with intramuscular (IM) penicillin for 3 weeks. At the time of discharge, his @di$ headache @/di$ and neck stiffness resolved and dysesthesias were decreased in intensity.	1
RESULTS: A 76-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus developed @di$ bacterial keratitis @/di$ and consecutive endophthalmitis in the corneal graft of the left eye. Corneal, aqueous, and vitreous cultures yielded @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$.	1
RESULTS: A combined model of bacterial species, including unclassified Escherichia, Veillonella parvula, @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$, Dorea formicigenerans, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7 1 58FAA, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus salivarius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lachnospiraceae Bacterium 5 1 63FAA, distinguished TAK patients from controls with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 87.8%, 85.9%, 81.1%, and 71.1% in training, test, and validation sets including healthy or BD controls, respectively. Diagnostic species were directly or indirectly (via metabolites or lipids) correlated with TAK phenotypes of vascular involvement, inflammation, discharge medication, and prognosis. External validation against publicly metagenomic studies (n = 184) on hypertension, @di$ atrial fibrillation @/di$, and healthy controls, confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of the model for TAK.	0
RESULTS: All refugees resulted negative for HBV, @di$ HCV @/di$ and HIV infections. In swabs a large number of unusual gram-negative bacteria species were isolated, such as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas monteilii, @gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$, Pseudomonas moselii, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinteobacter guilloviae, Acinteobacter lowffii; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Acinteobacter tjernbergae; Pantoea agglomerans; Pantoea calida.	0
RESULTS: Among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed @di$ infections @/di$ (25.0%). Fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. They included 34 Gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 Gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). The commonest pathogens were Escherichia coli (27.3%), @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ (12.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and Enterococcus faecium (10.9%). Among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found Escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). The results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of Gram negative strains to Meropenem was 2.8%, followed by Imipenem (5.6%), Sulperazone (22.8%) and Amikacin (28.7%). In this study Gram negative strains were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, some third generation Cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). None of Gram positive strains were resistant to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin. They were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, Clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary tract infection in Renji Hospital and the commonest pathogen is Escherichia coli. The @di$ infection of enterococcus @/di$ is going up. The mixed @di$ infection @/di$ cases happen mostly in acute @di$ biliary infection @/di$. (2) To treat @di$ biliary infection @/di$ the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to Escherichia coli are optimal choices. Ceftazidime or Ciprofloxacin may be used in mild @di$ biliary infection @/di$. Sulperazone or Amikacin may be used in severe @di$ biliary infection @/di$. Imipenem and Vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the @di$ infection @/di$ which other drugs are ineffective to.	1
RESULTS: Among @di$ bacterial keratitis @/di$ cases, uncommon species of Pseudomonas keratitis occurred at a rate of 2.2%. The mean age at presentation was 51.37 years, and the most common predisposing factor was corneal trauma (36.7%). The mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) [in log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)] at presentation was 1.99, and the mean ulcer size was 5.75 mm. On culture, 56.7% of the cases were identified as Pseudomonas putida , 26.7% as Pseudomonas stutzeri , 10% as @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$, and 3.3% each of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans and Pseudomonas alcaligenes .	1
RESULTS: From 1998 to 2006, @di$ diarrhea @/di$ was mainly caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus followed by Shigella and Salmonella. From 2007 to 2010, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection was the major cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ followed by Salmonella and Shigella. From 2011 to 2017, Salmonella infections became the main cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ after Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Salmonella infections increased from 2006 on and peaked between May and October, accounting for 82.48% of yearly infections. Patients with Salmonella infections (90.5%) had a history of eating unclean food, abdominal pain (58.05%), @di$ diarrhea @/di$ >=5 times a day (50.44%), moderate fever (24.96%) and increased fecal leukocytes (41.42%). From 1998 to 2017, infected specimens from clinical cases were dominated by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) (21.59%) followed by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritis (S. Enteritidis) (16.81%), Salmonella enterica serotype London (6.55%) and Salmonella group B (13.10%). Other species included Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson, Salmonella enterica serovar Saintpaul, Salmonella group D, Salmonella group C, @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ and Salmonella enterica serovar Aberdeen.	1
RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and @di$ hypergammaglobulinemia @/di$. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp.	1
RESULTS: The elderly people in this study presented reduced levels of Faecalibacterium genus and Bacteroides and @gm$ Blautia coccoides @/gm$ groups and increased Lactobacillus group, as well as reduced levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) when compared to younger adults. Moreover, they showed higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-12 as well as the chemokine IL-8. Significant @di$ nutritional deficiencies @/di$ were also observed in the elderly group.	1
RESULTS: The rumen bacterial diversity in domestic Sika deer (Cervus nippon) fed oak leaves- (@di$ OL @/di$ group) and corn stalks-based diets (CS group) were elucidated using 16S rRNA gene libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Overall, 239 sequences were examined from the two groups, 139 clones from the @di$ OL @/di$ group were assigned to 57 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 100 sequences from the CS group were divided into 50 OTUs. Prevotella-like sequences belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria in both groups (97.2% @di$ OL @/di$ and 77% CS), and sequences related to Prevotella brevis were present in both groups. However, Prevotella shahii-like, Prevotella veroralis-like, Prevotella albensis-like, and Prevotella salivae-like sequences were abundant in the @di$ OL @/di$ group compared to those in the CS group, while Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens-like and @gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$-like sequences were prevalent in the CS group.	0
RGMs including @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ typically cause localized @di$ cutaneous disease @/di$ in immunocompetent individuals secondary to puncture wounds, invasive medical or cosmetic procedures (due mainly to inadequate instrument sterilization), or with environmental exposures including contaminated liquids in tattoo studios or nail salons.	1
Radiographic evidence is best described by the presence of nodular or cavitary opacities on chest x-ray, or features of multifocal @di$ bronchiectasis @/di$ with nodules on CT scan. The most acceptable methods of microbiological evidence include positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples, or from at least one bronchial wash or lavage, or lung biopsy with mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM or biopsy showing mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB), and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM. Contamination of samples is not frequently encountered with @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$, therefore any positive isolation of @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ must be considered for therapy.	1
Radiographs revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Blood smear examination revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in peripheral lymphocytes, consistent with inclusion body disease. Cultures of a tracheal wash sample resulted in growth of Ochrobactrum intermedium and @gm$ Pseudomonas putida @/gm$. Echocardiographic examination revealed a large vegetative lesion on the right atrioventricular valve with valvular insufficiency, a mildly dilated right atrium, and pulmonary hypertension. Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and bacterial endocarditis with dystrophic mineralization of the right atrioventricular valve, associated with different bacteria than those cultured from the tracheal wash.	1
Raffinose has become a major focus of research interest and recent studies have shown that besides beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae can also utilize raffinose and raffinose might lead to @di$ flatulence @/di$ in some hosts. Therefore, it is required to find out the raffinose-metabolizing bacteria in the gut and the bacteria responsible for the @di$ flatulence @/di$. The BLASTP search results showed that the homologous proteins of glycosidases related to raffinose utilization are widely distributed in 196 of the 528 gut bacterial strains. Fifty-nine bacterial strains belonging to nine species of five genera were isolated from human feces and were found to be capable of utilizing raffinose; of these species, Enterococcus avium and Streptococcus salivarius were reported for the first time. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the supernatants of the nine species revealed that the bacteria could utilize raffinose in different manners. Glucose and melibiose were detected in the supernatants of Enterococcus avium E5 and Streptococcus salivarius B5, respectively. However, no resulting saccharides of raffinose degradation were detected in the supernatants of other seven strains, indicating that they had different raffinose utilization types from Enterococcus avium E5 and Streptococcus salivarius B5. Gas was produced with raffinose utilization by @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus pasteurianus and Enterococcus avium.	1
Rather than nests of individual @di$ amyloid @/di$ fibers that are observed within E. coli and @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ biofilms, @di$ amyloid @/di$-containing extracellular matrices produced by Gram-positive species appear more like sheets or mats of aggregated material. Such extracellular matrices also contain polysaccharides and extracellular DNA whose interaction with amyloid and amyloidogenic proteins is a growing topic of study. It has been speculated that @di$ amyloid @/di$ serves as a tool for mediating intercellular interactions characteristic of biofilm communities. Indeed, immunogold staining for P1 and AgA within S. mutans biofilms revealed both to be contained largely within extracellular matrices that connected cells to one another. Our current study asked whether @di$ amyloid @/di$ formation within growing and maturing S. mutans biofilms promotes cellular accumulation on the underlying surface or alternatively contributes to cellular and extracellular matrix interactions that facilitate biofilm detachment (Fig. 8). Our results support the latter scenario. Hence, a new model is emerging in which @di$ amyloid @/di$ aggregation appears to serve as a mechanism to temper the adhesive activity of the component polypeptides, facilitating the detachment of cells and extracellular material from aging biofilms. As the biofilms age, CR-induced birefringence and staining with anti-C123 and anti-AgA antibodies appear patchy and punctate in nature and are not congruent with the more tightly adherent layer. In addition, @di$ amyloid @/di$ aggregation of two different proteins, C123 and Cnm, abrogates their ability to competitively inhibit the adhesion of S. mutans to their cognate substrates, namely, immobilized SAG and collagen, respectively. Thus, dampening of the primary adhesive function of S. mutans adhesins following their @di$ amyloid @/di$ aggregation may represent a conserved mechanism to facilitate the detachment and dissemination of biofilm material from a solid surface.	1
Rats with @di$ constipation @/di$ also frequently have poor gastrointestinal motility, which may be reflected in the level of gastrointestinal active peptides. There are two categories of digestive active peptides: excitatory and inhibitory. Three types of gastrointestinal peptides were used in this study. MTL and GAS are excitatory, and VIP is inhibitory. MTL can stimulate pepsin production and duodenal contraction, both of which help in gastrointestinal peristalsis. GAS helps to encourage pyloric sphincter relaxation and gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction. VIP is a vasoactive intestinal peptide that helps relax smooth muscle. A growing body of evidence points to the role of gut flora in reducing @di$ constipation @/di$ caused by loperamide hydrochloride via these gastrointestinal peptides. We also found that the three strains had different regulatory effects on active gastrointestinal peptides in @di$ constipated @/di$ rats. 6M4 and S3 primarily act on GAS and VIP, and 10M2 mostly acts on MTL and VIP. This suggests that various @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ strains have different mechanisms for relieving @di$ constipation @/di$. In terms of dose, 6M4-L showed a better ability to control gastrointestinal peptides than 6M4-H and 6M4-M. This shows that administration of @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ at high concentrations directly to the colon might be useless.	2
"Recent evidences demonstrate that @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$ is effective in improving metabolic disorders and is thus considered as a promising ""next-generation beneficial microbe"". In addition to the live @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$, similar or even stronger beneficial effects have been observed in pasteurized @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ and its components, including the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$-derived extracellular vesicles (AmEVs), and secreted protein P9. Hence, this paper presents a systemic review of recent progress in the effects and mechanisms of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ and its components in the treatment of metabolic diseases, including @di$ obesity @/di$, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as perspectives on its future study."	2
Recent investigations in the murine colon have shown that Bacteroides species such as Bacteroides massiliensis, @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides ovatus downregulate ACE2 receptor expression, which inversely correlates with COVID-19 severity. Moreover, receptor downregulation markedly reduces antimicrobial peptide secretion as well as enteric tryptophan (Try) absorption. A recent report demonstrated that plasma levels of this essential amino acid have been significantly reduced in ACE2-depleted mice. Tryptophan is actively absorbed from the intestines and serves as the main precursor for the synthesis of tryptamine and serotonin neurotransmitters. Emerging evidence showed that its deficiency plays a key role in the development of @di$ anxiety @/di$, depression, fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep, and mood disturbances.	2
Recent reclassification of the Klebsiella genus to include @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$, and its association with @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and mortality, has raised concerns. We examined Klebsiella spp. infections among battlefield trauma patients, including occurrence of invasive @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ disease. Klebsiella isolates collected from 51 wounded military personnel (2009-2014) through the Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study were examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolates were evaluated for hypermucoviscosity phenotype by the string test. Patients were severely injured, largely from blast injuries, and all received antibiotics prior to Klebsiella isolation. Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella isolates were identified in 23 (45%) patients; however, there were no significant differences when patients with and without multidrug-resistant Klebsiella were compared. A total of 237 isolates initially identified as K. pneumoniae were analyzed, with 141 clinical isolates associated with infections (remaining were colonizing isolates collected through surveillance groin swabs). Using PCR sequencing, 221 (93%) isolates were confirmed as K. pneumoniae, 10 (4%) were @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$, and 6 (3%) were K. quasipneumoniae. Five @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolates were associated with infections. Compared to K. pneumoniae, infecting @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolates were more likely to be from blood (4/5 versus 24/134, p = 0.04), and less likely to be multidrug-resistant (0/5 versus 99/134, p<0.01). No @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolates demonstrated the hypermucoviscosity phenotype. Although @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolates were frequently isolated from bloodstream infections, they were less likely to be multidrug-resistant. Further work is needed to facilitate diagnosis of @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ and clarify its clinical significance in larger prospective studies.	1
Recent studies have also shown association of both symptomatic and asymptomatic @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ infections with growth faltering in children from developing countries. Approximately 24 million (35.2%) children under five, from East Africa were stunted, 4.1 million (6%) were wasted, and 2.9 million (4.3%) were overweight in 2018. High exposure to enteric pathogens may result in environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a subclinical disorder of the small intestine characterized by @di$ villous atrophy @/di$, crypt elongation, inflammatory cells infiltration of the crypts and a loss of barrier function or increased permeability. EED is considered to be involved in the causal pathway from pathogen exposure to stunting. A study in multi-country settings, @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp.	1
Recent studies have demonstrated evidence of low-grade mucosal inflammation and a link to the gut microbiota in some @di$ IBS @/di$ patients similar to @di$ IBD @/di$. The use of antibiotics provided a connection for the role of the gut microbiota in @di$ IBS @/di$. Previously a case-control study has reported that antibiotic use was linked to an increased risk of developing @di$ IBS @/di$. More recently, 83% of patients who developed GI symptoms reported antibiotic use. Changes in the microbiome and the development of @di$ IBS @/di$ has been reported extensively (reviewed in Pimentel et al.). Numerous studies have compared the intestinal microbiota in @di$ IBS @/di$ to a healthy control and found a lower microbial diversity and an increase in firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes ratio in @di$ IBS @/di$ subjects. Data suggest that an increased methane production as a result of archeal microbial species such as @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$ can influence intestinal motor activity leading to constipation. A placebo-controlled trial showed that an antibiotic combination used to eradicate methane from the breath resulted in significant improvements in symptoms of constipation in @di$ IBS @/di$. A recent consensus now considers methane in the breath as an accurate indicator of intestinal colonization with methane producing microbes and is an important tool for assessment of constipation in @di$ IBS @/di$.	1
Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota dysbiosis is related to @di$ arthritis diseases @/di$, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, yet the association between gut microbiota and gout remains poorly characterized. A previous study showed the abundance of Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ was significantly enriched in gout patients, whereas the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum was decreased.	1
Recent studies on stress-induced gastric mucosal lesions demonstrated that using a mixture of probiotics (@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Acetobacter) enhanced ulcer healing by restoring the balance between pro- and anti-oxidants in the gastric mucosa. In addition, probiotic mixtures (comprising Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and VKB with or without Lactobacillus casei IMVB-7280) enhanced the recovery of stress hormones (adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone), decreased proinflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, pretreatment with Clostridium byturicum attenuated the elevation of proinflammatory factors (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and leukotriene B4) in mice with induced @di$ gastric ulcer @/di$.	2
Recent studies on the skin microbiome show that skin-related diseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, urticaria, and @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ in children, are associated with changes in A. muciniphila abundance. A. muciniphila abundance decreases in chronic urticaria but increases in infantile eczema. The changes in A. muciniphila abundance in psoriasis are controversial. A significant increase in A. muciniphila abundance in patients with psoriasis is contrary to the findings of some research teams. However, A. muciniphila abundance is also a marker of psoriasis biotherapy. Changes in A. muciniphila abundance are most significant in patients who receive systemic biotherapy compared to controls. However, this study did not sample individual patients at different time points, and the experimental results are susceptible to many potentially confounding factors, such as the effects of age, sex, and severity of disease. The combination of Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Escherichia coli, @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$, and A. muciniphila can be used to identify whether pediatric @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ is related to food allergy.	1
Recently infections with hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ are increasingly being detected, but these organisms generally cause @di$ sepsis @/di$ related with blood stream infection or nosocomial pneumonia (C.	1
Recently, a meta-analysis of gastric mucosa and associated microbiota demonstrated the @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogens @gm$ Fusobacterium nucleatum @/gm$ (@gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$), Parvimonas micra, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis as interacting and hub nodes associated with other gastric cancer-associated species and tumor status. The @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogen @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ has been most strongly implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and is known to induce inflammation and suppress anticancer immune responses in CRC. @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ infection of neutrophils is known to induce NETosis. In CRC, the circulatory transmission of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ is the dominant mechanism, which suggests that systemic @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ and its immune signatures may be similarly relevant in other associated cancers. In particular, some @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ strains are shown to impede neutrophil-mediated oxidative killing, which could be implicated in its role in gastric cancer pathogenesis. In case of H. pylori, also a gram-negative pathogen, infection is also shown to promote N1 neutrophil subtype marked by nuclear hypersegmentation but such mechanisms in case of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ stimulated neutrophils are not yet investigated. As neutrophils play a central role in the tumor microenvironment, the role of @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$-induced neutrophil deregulation in gastric cancer merits further investigation.	1
Recently, probiotics have attracted increasing interest preventing and treating @di$ vaginal disorders @/di$. Various types of probiotics administered orally with yogurt or as lactobacilli capsules, or by inserting lactobacilli in the form of tampons, have been studied to improve the vaginal environment. Notably, a @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ mixture (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum RC-14) inhibited BV recurrence, and a probiotic mixture (Respecta ; L. rhamnosus HN001, Lactobacillus acidophilus GLa-14, and lactoferrin RCXTM) achieved probiotic colonization in the vaginas of healthy women. Although the replacement of antibiotics with probiotics to prevent @di$ vaginitis @/di$, eliminate pathogens, and improve the vaginal environment is gaining traction, studies on improving the quality of the vaginal environment using @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ are limited.	2
Recently, we described an outbreak of @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ in a neonatal special care unit. Using WGS we were able to demonstrate links between patient isolates and environmental samples and demonstrate that contaminated washing detergent was the likely source of @di$ infection @/di$.	1
Recovered patients presented higher abundance of B.luti, @gm$ C. comes @/gm$, D. longicatena, F. prausnitzii, R. litaburensis, R. timonensis and R. cecicola, while healthy volunteers and increased levels of A. rectalis, A. senegalensis, G. formicilis, B. adolescentis, P. xylanivorans, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, E. xylanophilum, D. longicatena, F. prausnitzii and S. wadsworthensis. The above-mentioned bacterial species are B. adolescentis, a bacterium with the capacity to sustain the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), F. prausnitzii, that is able to increase the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, through induction of human colonic regulatory T cells, E. rectale, a bacterium that has been already associated with a diminution of inflammation in @di$ Alzheimer's disease @/di$, Ruminococcus obeum and D.	2
Recovery of a viable culturable organism is increasingly critical as disease surveillance and control efforts for @di$ typhoidal @/di$ @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ shift toward using data from whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which requires a live organism. In these analyses, geospatial, geographical, and temporal data are integrated with WGS data derived from S. Typhi isolated from positive blood or stool cultures to monitor genotype circulation and antimicrobial resistance and to assess S. Typhi population structures before and after a @di$ typhoid @/di$ vaccination intervention. Few genomic epidemiology analyses apply WGS to environmentally derived @di$ typhoidal @/di$ @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolates alongside clinical isolates. However, in one example, a genetic comparison completed in the mid-1990s using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to characterize clinical and environmental (sewage and river water) isolates from Santiago, Chile, from 1983 demonstrated overlap between the human and environmental samples. While the genomic resolution of PFGE is insufficient to decipher microcirculation patterns compared with that of WGS, these data further supported the conclusion that irrigation of vegetable crops with untreated sewage was responsible for amplified long-cycle transmission that maintained @di$ typhoid @/di$ endemicity in Santiago in the 1980s. Within this gap in @di$ typhoidal @/di$ genomic epidemiology, the Moore swab may provide live culturable environmental isolates that, compared against human-derived isolates, will directly contribute to new models of transmission mechanics supporting either short-cycle or long-cycle transmission.	1
Reduced production of AHR ligands by the gut microbiota is a key factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndromes such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and high blood @di$ pressure @/di$. Recent studies also demonstrated that epithelial indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), one of two rate-limiting enzymes in the tryptophan catabolic pathway, promotes secretory cell differentiation and enhances the mucus layer and mucus-associated microbiota (i.e., @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$) by modulating AHR signaling.	2
Regarding both @di$ CM @/di$ and SIOM, the dissimilarity contribution was observed to be highest for Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus cereus groups. However, V.dispar, @gm$ P. melaninogenica @/gm$, and F. periodonticum had ~3% dissimilarity contribution with higher abundance expressed at the @di$ CM @/di$ interface. Furthermore, in specific periodontally related indicator species (Supplementary Note), the pathogenic Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium genera were observed in the PC and @di$ CM @/di$ groups only.	1
Regarding the associations between gMB composition and @di$ frailty @/di$, we found a significant increase in the abundance of several bacterial species in F-CKD respect to NF-CKD. Many of these bacteria (Coriobacteriaceae family, Anaerotruncus, Coprobacillus and Dorea genera and Eubacterium dolichum and Eggerthella lenta species) have already been associated to @di$ frailty @/di$ in various studies. Some of them (Eggerthella, Coprobacillus and Oscillospira genera) have been previously described as correlates of biological aging or abundant in elderly individuals (Mogibacteriacaee, Coriobacteriaceae families and Lactobacillus, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ species). Furthermore, some bacteria seem to be positively correlated also with different nutritional and physical features: Eubacterium dolichum has been associated with obesity and western diet in mice, and Oscillospira genus has been found in high concentrations in the stools of lean subjects. The latter has been also associated with urinary PCS levels and positively correlated with age in previous studies. In our cohort, Oscillospira genus significantly correlated with MIS, which is significantly higher in F-CKD individuals. Nevertheless, although F-CKD have lower lean mass compared with NF-CKD, this difference was not statistically significant. These results might suggest that @di$ frailty @/di$ could be in part dependent more on functional than structural changes of muscular and/or neurological systems.	1
Regarding the importance of the gut microbiota, these probiotic strains mainly originate from the human microbiome symbionts including @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$, F. prausnitzii, and several Bacteroides species. @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ as an abundant bacterium within the host intestine is involved in regulating metabolic pathways, modulating the immune response, and preserving the intestinal barrier. The prevalence of this bacterium is negatively associated with obesity, T2D, IBD, and appendicitis. Daily administration of 1010 @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ bacteria to obese volunteers for 90 days is reported to reduce insulin resistance, plasma cholesterol, and the risk for developing @di$ liver dysfunction @/di$ and inflammation, whereas no significant alteration is demonstrated in the gut microbiota.	2
Renal @di$ calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones @/di$ are a common kidney disease. There are few methods for reducing the formation of these stones. However, the potential of probiotics for reducing renal stones has received increasing interest. We previously isolated a strain of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N-1 from traditional cheese in China. This study aimed to investigate the effects of N-1 on renal @di$ CaOx crystal deposition @/di$. Thirty rats were randomly allocated to three groups: control group (ddH2O by gavage), model group [ddH2O by gavage and 1% ethylene glycol (EG) in drinking water], and Lactiplantibacillus group (N-1 by gavage and 1% EG in drinking water). After 4 weeks, compared with the model group, the group treated with N-1 exhibited significantly reduced renal crystals (P < 0.05). In the ileum and caecum, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ were higher in the control group, and those of Ruminococcaceae UCG 007 and Rikenellaceae RC9 were higher in the N-1-supplemented group. In contrast, the relative abundances of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium 1, Jeotgalicoccus, Psychrobacter, and Aerococcus were higher in the model group. We also predicted that the arginase level would be higher in the ileal microbiota of the model group than in the N-1-supplemented group with PICRUSt2. The arginase activity was higher, while the level of arginine was lower in the ileal contents of the model group than in the N-1-supplemented group. The arginine level in the blood was also higher in the N-1-supplemented group than in the model group. In vitro studies showed that exposure to arginine could reduce CaOx crystal adhesion to renal epithelial HK-2 cells. Our findings highlighted the important role of N-1 in reducing renal CaOx crystals by regulating arginine metabolism in the gut microbiota. Probiotics containing L. plantarum N-1 may be potential therapies for preventing renal @di$ CaOx stones @/di$.	2
Reports on @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ as a primary pathogen are scarce in the veterinary medicine field, and none exist in fish. In this study, we report @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ as a primary pathogen affecting rainbow trout, causing @di$ ocular proptosis @/di$, which induces continuous mortality in the fish and leads to economic losses in rainbow trout fisheries.	1
Representative strains of two subspecies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus (subspecies melaninogenicus and subspecies intermedius) and @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$ as well as B. asaccharolyticus strain 536B isolated from a human @di$ perirectal abscess @/di$ and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 were examined by glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation, ruthenium red fixation and staining, and thorium hydroxyde staining as well as by the physical preparative techniques of critical point drying--transmission electron microscopy (CPD--TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).	0
Requirements for virulence factors are known to change with different @di$ infection @/di$ models and also as the @di$ infection @/di$ proceeds. It has been reported that in some pathogens a particular phase variant, or even phase variation per se, is required only at a particular @di$ infection @/di$ stage and not throughout the entire @di$ infection @/di$ process. This may as well apply to Vpmas and their phase variation during sheep infections. Although PLMU was cleared in the beginning, PLMY could successfully establish local @di$ infection @/di$ even in the absence of Vpma phase variation. But, at later stages of @di$ infection @/di$, likely to cope with host defence and to persist, or to become systemic, it was necessary for the organism to vary the Vpma phase, and hence the selection pressure that induced Xer1-independent alternate 'switches' in PLMs. This is supported by an earlier study where PG2 type strain induced better systemic responses and also disseminated better in @di$ infected @/di$ sheep compared to PLMs, likely by delaying the host anti-Vpma antibody response by varying the Vpma antigens as observed in case of SLP antigenic variation of @gm$ Campylobacter fetus @/gm$. Also, considering that Vpmas have adherence epitopes, their differential adherence rates might also govern the selection of different Vpma variants at specific stages of local or systemic @di$ infections @/di$ as observed in other pathogens.	1
Researchers have emphasized the significant roles played by the intestinal microbiota in the development of diseases associated with overweight and @di$ obesity @/di$, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Prof. Patrice D. Cani discovered a very particular bacterium called @gm$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/gm$, which has beneficial effects on health by strengthening the intestinal barrier, decreasing body weight and fat mass gain while decreasing insulin resistance and diabetes. Recently, his team discovered a new bacterium called Dysosmobacter welbionis, a completely new genus isolated from the human intestine. Interestingly, they found that this bacterium was present in the intestinal microbiota of the general population but was less abundant in the intestines of individuals with @di$ obesity @/di$ and type 2 diabetes. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the administration of this bacterium improves the health of @di$ obese @/di$ and diabetic mice.	2
Resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was transferred from Escherichia coli in the intestine of a patient with shigellosis to a @gm$ Shigella sonnei @/gm$ strain. In a second patient with partial @di$ ureteral obstruction @/di$, a resistant E.	0
Results obtained through biochemical tests also indicated a high level of agreement with those obtained from most researchers, as most of the @gm$ ORT @/gm$ isolations grew on blood agar as the main agar. However, some studies demonstrated the susceptibility of bacteria to blood analysis, this feature had not been attributed with @gm$ ORT @/gm$. This advantage has been observed to be due to an iron acquisition mechanism with which the pathogen overcomes a host's ability to limit iron during @di$ infections @/di$.	1
Results of surgical exploration showed an @di$ abscess @/di$ involving the pseudocapsule, trochanteric bursa, and periprosthetic cement column. Cultures grew @gm$ Clostridium difficile @/gm$, an unusual pathogen in this site.	1
Results of the current study showed that diets supplemented with @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ ZPA017 increased serum IgG and IgA concentrations in sows, demonstrating that @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ ZPA017 had beneficial effect on immune function so as to improve health status and performance of sows. This result agreed with a previous study showing that Lactobacillus johnsonii XS4 supplementation increased the serum IgG concentration in sows. However, the mechanism for enhancing immune function by @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ was not clear, the reason might be that the probiotic could regulate intestinal microflora and stimulate intestinal tissue to produce immunoglobulin. In addition, the enhancement of immunoglobulin in serum could be beneficial to piglets because immunoglobulin can be translocated from blood to colostrum, which provides humoral immune protection for the new-born piglets and possibly protects them against potential diseases. Although the sows' colostrum and milk immunoglobulin levels were not observed in this study, the decreased @di$ diarrhea @/di$ incidence of piglets in sows fed @gm$ P. acidilactici @/gm$ ZPA017 might be related to the improved serum immunoglobulin concentrations in sows.	2
Results showed that the potential pathogens in the STP were relatively affiliated with 29 genera in each of SI (6,952 sequences) and @di$ PE @/di$ (10,086 sequences), among which Arcobacter had the highest relative abundance (Fig 2A). Both the conventional and advanced sewage treatment processes applied in the STP demonstrated high pathogen removal efficiency since only 440, 418, 292 and 219 sequences were found closely related to known pathogens in AS, SE, FFE and FRE, respectively (S7 Table). Comparison in absolute terms showed the similar results (S6 Table). Further analysis of the Illumina sequencing datasets by MetaPhlAn showed that a total of 32 species of the potential pathogens were detected in the six samples (Fig 2B), among which 30, 25, 18, 7, 5 and 4 species were present in SI, @di$ PE @/di$, AS, SE, FFE and FRE, respectively. Among the species, A. butzleri was most abundant in each sample. A. hydrophila, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were also found prevalent in SI and @di$ PE @/di$ (over 1.85% each). A. hydrophila, Bordetella pertussis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also had high abundance in SE after oxidation ditch treatment. Comparatively, A. hydrophila had a decreased abundance and @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ had an increased abundance in both FFE and FRE.	0
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (@di$ PD @/di$) are chronic inflammatory disorders that cause bone loss. @di$ PD @/di$ tends to be more prevalent and severe in RA patients. Previous experimental studies demonstrated that RA triggers alveolar bone loss similarly to @di$ PD @/di$. The aim of this study was to investigate if arthritis-induced alveolar bone loss is associated with modification in the oral microbiota. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to analyze forty oral bacterial species in 3 groups of C57BL/6 mice: control (n = 12; without any challenge); Y4 (n = 8; received oral inoculation of Aggregatibacter Actinomycetemcomitans strain FDC Y4) and AIA group (n = 12; chronic antigen-induced arthritis). The results showed that AIA and Y4 group exhibited similar patterns of bone loss. The AIA group exhibited higher counts of most bacterial species analyzed with predominance of Gram-negative species similarly to infection-induced @di$ PD @/di$. Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola were detected only in the Y4 group whereas Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis were only found in the AIA group. Counts of @gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$, Selenomonas Noxia and Veillonella parvula were greater in the AIA group whereas Actinomyces viscosus and Neisseira mucosa were in large proportion in Y4 group.	1
Risk factors for precipitation of overt and sometimes unusual manifestations of nontyphi Salmonella infection include underlying malignancy, corticosteroid and cytotoxic therapy, collagen vascular disease, alcoholism, liver disease, @di$ sickle-cell disease @/di$ and other hemolytic illness, previous surgery and prior antibiotic therapy). AIDS also an important risk factor for the recent two decades). Cellular immunity plays an important role in the control of infection by nontyphi @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$.	1
Roseburia is a butyrate producer that utilizes acetate and increases serotonin and melatonin and is reduced in ulcerative colitis and @di$ hypertension @/di$; treatment with Roseburia hominis in ulcerative colitis has been shown to strengthen gut barrier function and enhance T regulatory cells. Ruminococcus bacteria produce secondary bile acids. @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ is an equol producer and low abundances have been associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis.	0
Roseburia is one of the most abundant intestinal butyrate-producing bacteria and has been linked with a reduction in inflammation and anti-@di$ obesity @/di$ effects. In addition, administration of naringenin in a letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome model in rats has shown a positive impact on the relative abundance of the genus Roseburia. Moreover, in a randomized controlled human intervention trial, three weeks of supplementation with virgin olive oil enriched with 500 mg phenolic compounds increased abundance of Roseburia, though it did not reach statistical significance. @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ has the capacity to metabolize numerous polyphenols, through ring-opening by use of the enzyme chalcone isomerase, as well as further reductive metabolism by an NADH-dependent reductase. Through these activities and the metabolites produced as a consequence, @gm$ E. ramulus @/gm$ is thought to contribute to alleviation of @di$ obesity @/di$.	2
Rough lipopolysaccharide, extracted by a mixture of phenol, chloroform, and petroleum ether from freeze-dried @gm$ Brucella ovis @/gm$ cells with a yield of 0.71%, contained relatively small amounts of protein and nucleic acid contaminants as compared with lipopolysaccharides from other Brucellae. The crude lipopolysaccharide was suitable as a diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the sensitive and specific detection of ram @di$ epididymitis @/di$ caused by B. ovis infection. In comparative serological tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ lipopolysaccharide gave better identification of infections and fewer false-negative results than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with sonicated antigen or the complement fixation test.	1
Routine cultures from tissue of the infected finger led to the diagnosis of @di$ paronychia @/di$ due to staphylococcus aureus. Despite surgical and antibacterial treatment, the lesion persisted and the patient developed multiple raised, non-tender satellite lesions to the right hand and elbow. Based on the clinical aspect and a detailed history (she kept fish and had suffered a chicken bone stab to her middle finger 12 weeks earlier), we suspected a Mycobacterium marinum infection. Tissue was obtained mainly by synovialectomy. Culture of the biopsy tissue for @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ confirmed the diagnosis. The patient responded to a triple therapy (rifabutin, ethambutol and clarithromycin) and had an uncomplicated recovery. The importance of a high index of suspicion, adequate examination and a complete patient's history for a correct diagnosis is stressed. Culture for @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ is not routinely performed and ought to be initiated once an infection is suspected.	1
Ruminococcus bromii (strain ATCC 27255) and @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans (strain @/gm$ CRCHUM12T) were grown on anaerobe basal broth (ABB; Oxoid) agar plates. Escherichia coli (strain CRCHUM10) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (strain CRCHUM9) were grown on tryptone soya agar with 5% sheep blood (Oxoid). R. bicirculans, B. thetaiotaomicron, and E. coli were isolated in our laboratory from the feces of patients with @di$ melanoma @/di$.	0
Saccharomyces boulardii significantly ameliorates colon damage and regulates inflammatory responses in mice with @di$ colitis @/di$ induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) through changes in the microbiome composition and SCFA metabolism. @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ is a facultative anaerobic bacterium of Firmicutes with a high salt tolerance, and it plays an important role in enhancing immunity, producing bacteriocins, maintaining the balance of intestinal flora, and improving the intestinal barrier. The intervention of @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ FZU106 was observed to obviously increase SCFA levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic rats, which was strongly associated with changes in gut microbial composition and metabolism. Saccharomyces boulardii has been observed to be safe for use in dogs with chronic enteritis and to control clinical symptoms better than standard treatment alone. The use of Enterococcus faecium SF68 in cats infected with latent feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) reduced morbidity and maintained fecal microbiota diversity. Studies on Saccharomyces boulardii and @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ in pet cats have rarely been reported, and this trial investigated the effect of a multistrain probiotic preparation added to the diet on intestinal fecal microbial diversity, microbiota-derived SCFA production, antioxidative status, and fecal inflammatory markers in healthy short-haired domestic cats. This study provides an innovative platform to further investigate the significance of Saccharomyces boulardii and @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ with respect to the intestinal health of companion animals.	0
Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B (@gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$) is a major foodborne pathogen distributed all over the world. However, little is known about the antibiotic resistance, genetic relatedness and virulence profile of @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolated from @di$ leafy vegetables @/di$ and the processing environment in Malaysia. In this study, 6 @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolates were recovered from different vegetables and drain water of processing areas obtained from fresh food markets in Malaysia. The isolates were characterized by antibiogram, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and virulence genes. Antibiotic susceptibility test showed that 3 of the isolates were resistant to the antibiotics. These include S. Paratyphi B SP251 isolate, which was resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, sulfonamides and streptomycin; Isolate SP246 which was resistant to chloramphenicol, sulfonamides and streptomycin and Isolate SP235 showing resistance to nalidixic acid only. PFGE subtyped the 6 @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolates into 6 distinct XbaI-pulsotypes, with a wide range of genetic similarity (0.55 to 0.9). The isolates from different sources and fresh food markets location were genetically diverse. Thirteen (tolC, orgA, spaN, prgH, sipB, invA, pefA, sofB, msgA, cdtB, pagC, spiA and spvB) out of the 17 virulence genes tested were found in all of the @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolates. Another gene (lpfC), was found only in one isolate (SP051). None of the isolates possessed sifA, sitC and ironN genes. In summary, this study provides unique information on antibiotic resistance, genetic relatedness, and virulotyping of @gm$ S. Paratyphi B @/gm$ isolated from @di$ leafy vegetables @/di$ and processing environment.	0
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi A @/gm$, B and C cause enteric fever, a systemic febrile illness that occurs only in humans. There are more than 2500 serovars of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). NTS infects a variety of hosts and are frequently zoonotic in origin. It mainly causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans. NTS has also been recognized as a major cause of extra-intestinal invasive bacterial infection in young children and immunocompromised patients worldwide. It is a cause of severe @di$ bacteremia @/di$. It has been estimated that globally about 3.4 million cases of @di$ bacteremia @/di$ due to NTS occur every year.	1
Scedosporium boydii is a pathogenic filamentous fungus that causes a wide range of human infections, notably respiratory infections in patients with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$. The development of new therapeutic strategies targeting @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ necessitates a better understanding of the physiology of this fungus and the identification of new molecular targets. In this work, we studied the conidium-to-germ tube transition using a variety of techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, two-phase partitioning, microelectrophoresis and cationized ferritin labeling, chemical force spectroscopy, lectin labeling, and nanoLC-MS/MS for cell wall GPI-anchored protein analysis. We demonstrated that the cell wall undergoes structural changes with germination accompanied with a lower hydrophobicity, electrostatic charge and binding capacity to cationized ferritin. Changes during germination also included a higher accessibility of some cell wall polysaccharides to lectins and less CH3/CH3 interactions (hydrophobic adhesion forces mainly due to glycoproteins). We also extracted and identified 20 GPI-anchored proteins from the cell wall of @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$, among which one was detected only in the conidial wall extract and 12 only in the mycelial wall extract. The identified sequences belonged to protein families involved in virulence in other fungi like Gelp/Gasp, Crhp, Bglp/Bgtp families and a superoxide dismutase. These results highlighted the cell wall remodeling during germination in @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ with the identification of a substantial number of cell wall GPI-anchored conidial or hyphal specific proteins, which provides a basis to investigate the role of these molecules in the host-pathogen interaction and fungal virulence.	1
Seattle study participants were predominately young Caucasian women with a low prevalence of genital infections; there were no significant differences between women with and without @di$ cervicitis @/di$ with regards to race, ethnicity, sexual behaviors, or the presence of co-infections (p >0.1, Table 1). Women with @di$ cervicitis @/di$ were more likely to have @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, formerly @gm$ BVAB3 @/gm$, detected in the cervix (42.9% vs. 11.9%, p=0.020) and in the vagina (42.9% vs. 16.7%, p=0.067) than women without @di$ cervicitis @/di$ (Table 2). In addition, there was a trend towards an association between detection of Megasphaera species type 2 in the cervix and @di$ cervicitis @/di$ (28.6% vs. 7.1%, p=0.058). Lactobacillus jensenii was the only lactobacillus species inversely associated with @di$ cervicitis @/di$, detected in the cervix of 52.4% of women without @di$ cervicitis @/di$ and only 14.3% of women with @di$ cervicitis @/di$ (p=0.015). No statistically significant associations between @di$ cervicitis @/di$ and the concentration of bacterial species were observed among women with detectable levels of the species (Figures S1-S2 in SDC_Text); 16S and 18S rRNA gene copy numbers (indicators of sampling error) also showed no association with @di$ cervicitis @/di$ (data not shown).	1
Second, only a minority of all patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ have stool specimens collected for culture, as stool culture is not required in China for diarrheal patients. Finally, the @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ isolation rate was not very high, possibly because of previous antibiotic use or laboratory testing sensitivity.	1
Second, we found that the increase in the severity of the @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like phenotype was accompanied by differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota among 2 M, 4 M, and 6 M mice (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 1g). By analyzing the dominant species in the feces from 2 M, 4 M, and 6 M mice (Fig. 1g), we found that, the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ was higher in 6 M mice, and Parabacteroides distasonis was higher in 2 M mice (Fig. 1h). These results were verified by qPCR (Fig. 1i, j). In addition, the abundance of Alistipes was higher in 6 M mice (also increased in mice after co-housing and FMT) and Alistipes was reported to be more abundant in patients after the higher-fat diet intervention, which indicated its potential role in abnormal lipid metabolism. To detect the colonization of Parabacteroides distasonis and @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ in colon, bacterial FISH (Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization) was performed and the result showed that colonic sections from 2 M, 4 M, and 6 M mice exhibited increased hybridization of the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ probe Prv392 and decreased hybridization of the Parabacteroides distasonis probe PD (Fig.	1
Secretion rate, pH, and buffer capacity of paraffin-stimulated saliva and the prevalence of salivary @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$ and lactobacilli were examined in 98 consecutive patients (22 men, 76 women) referred for @di$ orofacial discomfort @/di$ complaints related to 'oral galvanism'.	0
Sepsis or septic shock occurs in 24.2% of patients infected with @gm$ S. suis @/gm$, and 82% of patients with septic shock develop @di$ AKI @/di$. Huong et al. evaluated the clinical features of S. suis infection in a systematic review and meta-analysis and reported that 7.1% of patients developed @di$ acute renal injury @/di$. However, the mechanism underlying @di$ AKI @/di$ caused by S.	1
Sepsis, associated with @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ is rarely reported, despite current possibilities for microorganisms isolation and identification. About 100 cases of bacteriemia associated with this pathogen have been reported so far. Postpartum infectious complications are mostly associated with bacterial inhabitants of gastrointestinal tract and vagina, including obligatory anaerobes. This case report highlights @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$-associated severe @di$ endometritis @/di$ complicated by abdominal sepsis in a young healthy woman, and the challenges of antibacterial therapy.	1
Septic shock in association with @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ bacteremia, as in our patient, has been previously described as a complication of spontaneous @di$ bacterial peritonitis @/di$ and of pyonephrosis. Our case also appears to be the first to report simultaneous bacteremia with a second organism, Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, one previous publication describes the occurrence of Lactococcus garvieae bacteremia one month prior to demonstration of @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ bacteremia in a patient with native valve bacterial endocarditis.	1
Sequence analysis of the determinant showed high homology with the fim determinant from @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium @/gm$. The genes of the invasion determinant directed invasion of recombinant Escherichia coli K-12 strains into human epithelial cell lines of the bladder and gut as well as mannose-sensitive yeast agglutination and were termed fim(Cf) genes. Expression of the Fim(Cf) proteins was shown by (35)S labeling and/or Western blotting. In the infant rat model of experimental @di$ hematogenous meningitis @/di$, C.	1
Serious infections because of @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ out of the neonatal period have been rarely seen with the first case reported in 1966. @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ in adults has been shown to cause endocarditis, @di$ pharyngitis @/di$, otitis media, meningitis, brain abscesses, epiglottitis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, dental abscess, empyema, septicemia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, hepatobiliary infections, epidural abscesses, and urinary tract and genital infections.     However, reported pediatric infections have been limited to the upper and lower respiratory tract infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and brain abscesses in infants with long standing respiratory infections.  Documented cases of neonatal @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ are still very rare and the 11 reported cases (including ours) are shown in Table 1.  Hable et al suggested that neonatal infections may be rare because of presence of protective maternal antibodies. An important aspect of @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$ infection is that beta lactamase production occurs with a frequency that may be greater than H.	1
Serology results received later showed Legionella IgM titres of more than 1:256 for Legionella micdadei and @gm$ Legionella bozemanii @/gm$, and IgG titres of Legionella hackeliae. This case demonstrates relapsing @di$ pneumonia @/di$ due to Legionella micdadei and bozemanii infection, and previous exposure to Legionella hackeliae.	1
Serum antibody titers against Clostridium perfringens beta toxin, Clostridium novyi alpha toxin, and Clostridium septicum alpha toxin were determined with an ELISA; @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$ lethal toxin titers were determined with a toxin neutralization assay. RESULTS: Firm injection site @di$ swellings @/di$ developed in cattle vaccinated via either route; however, at several observation times, @di$ swellings @/di$ were significantly smaller in cattle vaccinated transdermally. Serum titers against C perfringens beta toxin and C septicum alpha toxin did not differ significantly between groups after vaccination; serum titers against C novyi alpha toxin were not significantly different between groups, except on days 10 and 56, when they were significantly higher in cattle vaccinated SC. Titers against @gm$ C sordellii @/gm$ lethal toxin were significantly higher in cattle vaccinated SC on several days after vaccination, but titers were not significantly different after day 49.	0
Seven of the @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ ST4 strains had been isolated from spinal fluid, two were from cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and one was from a case of @di$ bacteremia @/di$.	1
Several agents have been suggested as possible causes of @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in growing pigs, namely Brachyspira spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens type A, enterotoxic strains of Escherichia coli, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella spp., @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ spp., coronavirus, rotavirus, Isospora suis and Trichuris suis.	1
Several infectious etiologies, including viruses, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, leprosy, cat-scratch disease, and @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ can also present with paracortical expansion with necrosis and histiocytic infiltrate, thus mimicking KFD morphologically. @di$ Infectious mononucleosis @/di$ usually shows marked follicular hyperplasia and paracortical expansion with an increase in immunoblasts and scattered Hodgkin- and Reed-Sternberg-like cells.	0
Several post-mortem studies have also claimed an increased number of various microbes in the @di$ AD @/di$ brain. For example, Riviere et al. (2002) demonstrated the presence of 7 species of oral spirochetes (T. socranskii, T. pectinovorum, T. denticola, T. medium, T. amylovorum, T. maltophilum, @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$) in the human frontal lobe cortex, trigeminal ganglia, and hippocampus (14/16 @di$ AD @/di$ brains) by species-specific PCR and monoclonal antibodies. In another study, P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human @di$ AD @/di$ brains and strong glial cell surface membrane labeling of P. gingivalis LPS has been reported, but the specificity of the staining has been challenged. P. gingivalis and its toxic protease gingipain were detected in the human brains of live @di$ AD @/di$ subjects, though once more the specificity of staining has been questioned. Again, these studies are also confounded because many with @di$ AD @/di$ die from prolonged infection and likely sepsis, and controls in brain banks often have different causes of death.	1
Several recent large scale studies of global diarrheal disease burden and epidemiology, renewed recognition of multiple @di$ diarrhea @/di$ episodes as a serious impediment to the health and development of children in resource-poor countries, an upsurge in the investment by charitable foundations and governmental entities in combatting global infectious diseases and the emergence of new concepts in vaccination strategies collectively point to opportunities to develop new vaccines against very old diseases. In this paper, we first review up-to-date information on diarrheal disease burden as a rationale for the pursuit of vaccine development. The history of the development and challenges of combination pediatric vaccines are presented as a model for combination diarrheal vaccines for children in endemic parts of the world as well as for travelers. There are very few existing licensed vaccines against diarrheal diseases, and none are combinations. However, a survey of the current vaccine development landscape indicates that there may be multiple options for a combination vaccine against the leading enteric pathogens. The historic success of combination pediatric vaccines indicates that combinations may be the best approach to address the multiple pathogens responsible for diarrheal diseases worldwide. Combination vaccines require special attention to manufacture and formulation issues, and specific combinations must take into consideration the target population and disease burden. We discuss the potential for a combination ETEC/@gm$ Shigella @/gm$ vaccine as an example that addresses 2 of the most frequent causes of both endemic and traveler's @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
Several reports have shown that @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ can be isolated from humans at multiple sites, which presented a greater challenge for its clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent research has attempted to summarize the determinants of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ bacteremia. An earlier study showed that most @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ bacteremia exhibited serious intra-abdominal pathology. Our case, the patient admitted to the hospital due to appendicitis, was also consistent with this observation. @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$, which colonizes the intestinal tract, could easily invade the bloodstream through the damaged mucosa and cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$. However, other studies showed that patients with cancer, decubitus ulcers, and diabetes mellitus were more likely to suffer from @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ bacteremia.	1
Several studies have reported that gut microbiota in @di$ gout @/di$ patients were distinguished from healthy humans. For instance, @di$ gout @/di$ patients showed enrichment of Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ as well as a depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. A large metagenomics study, concerning the functional signature identification of gut microbiome in China people, also found that species belonging to the Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium genera were more enriched in @di$ gout @/di$ patients than healthy ones. At the same time, prebiotics, the live bacteria and yeasts that can replenish beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract, were reported to have a positive effect on treatments of @di$ gout @/di$ and hyperuricemia. Accordingly, there was a close relationship between @di$ gout @/di$ and gut microbiota, which had been focused on by many researchers. So far, inflammatory response, abnormal urate metabolism, and excessive lipopolysaccharide release resulting from dysbacteriosis in the intestine were the main directions for clarifying the mechanism of the pathological relationship between @di$ gout @/di$ and gut microbiota. Due to the numerous amounts of gut microbiota and its complicated function to hosts, it is challenging to identify @di$ gout @/di$-specific microbiota in the intestine. Nevertheless, deeply exploring the role of gut microbiota in @di$ gout @/di$ is necessary for a new sight for @di$ gout @/di$ therapy.	1
Several studies in humans indicated that @gm$ P. copri @/gm$ largely drives the increase of the microbial potential for BCAA biosynthesis, and these studies have suggested a causative role for serum level of BCAAs or their breakdown products in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$. Arachidonic acid is the substrate for the synthesis of a range of biologically active compounds, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These compounds can act as mediators and regulators of inflammatory cytokine production and immune function. As for AAAs, increased circulating concentration of AAAs has been reported to be associated with obesity and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ in humans. The correlation between the LMP-associated bacterial taxa and serum metabolites in pigs suggested that the gut microbiota, especially @gm$ P. copri @/gm$, drives elevated levels of serum BCAA, AAA, and the metabolites of arachidonic acid, implying that the gut microbiota should induce chronic inflammatory response via these metabolites, thereby resulting in host fat accumulation.	1
Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$, B.	2
Shigella is a common cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ with high rates of mortality, especially in children younger than 5 years old. The Shigella genus comprises four serogroups, including @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$, S.	1
Shigellosis is caused by gram-negative bacteria from the following four species of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$: Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri,@gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$, and Shigella sonnei through the fecal-oral route. The pathology can include bloody diarrhea (@di$ hemorrhagic colitis @/di$) followed by the often fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).	1
Shigellosis is often associated with intestinal complications, including @di$ intestinal perforation @/di$, intestinal obstruction, toxic dilatation of the colon, and prolapse of the rectum; systemic complications include septicaemia, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia, seizure, encephalopathy, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, and malnutrition. Arthritis and conjunctivitis are rare extra-intestinal complications of shigellosis. Annually, about 110,000 patients receive treatment in the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh for diarrhoea and diarrhoea-associated illnesses, of which 11% are due to shigellosis. However, arthritis associated with shigellosis has not been reported from this population. Arthritis has been reported in association with infection due to S. flexneri and @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ from other places.	1
Shotgun sequencing data identified several bacterial species associated with @di$ hypertension @/di$ (Figure 1C; Table S2). Ruminococcus gnavus was significantly enriched in @di$ hypertensives @/di$ within the whole cohort after adjusting for confounding variables in all the models (all P<0.01; Figure 1C; Table S2). However, upon stratification by sex, the positive association between R gnavus and @di$ hypertension @/di$ remained significant only in women (all P<0.01) and not in men (Figure 1C; Table S2). Additionally, Clostridium bolteae was found to have a significant positive association, and @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ had a negative association with @di$ hypertension @/di$ in women after adjusting for covariates (P<0.01-0.001 in m2-m4; Figure 1C; Table S2). The sex-stratified analysis showed that many of the associations between microbial species and @di$ hypertension @/di$ that were detected in the overall cohort remained consistent in women, whereas none were significant in men (Figure 1C; Table S2).	2
Shrimp and crab shell powder (SCSP), prepared by treating @di$ shellfish @/di$ processing waste with boiling and crushing, was used as a substrate for isolating chitinolytic microorganisms. Three potential strains (E1, J1, and J1-1) were isolated and identified as @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$, B.	0
Significant increases were seen in concentration, elation and introversion with significant decreases in @di$ fatigue @/di$, agitation, sensitivity, anxiety and depression. Decreased anxiety levels were also noted in a healthy population after a 12-week trial of probiotics containing @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium longum.	2
Similarly in @gm$ Streptococcus parasanguinis @/gm$, which also possesses a mntH gene, it was previously determined that the homologous fimCBA operon was not important for acid tolerance (Chen et al., ). Manganese transport has also been examined in S. sanguinis strain SK36, which possesses an ABC transport system encoded by the ssaACB operon that is homologous to sloABC and fimCBA. However, like most other strains of S. sanguinis, SK36 does not possess a mntH gene. The S. sanguinis studies have established the importance of manganese not for acid tolerance, but for virulence in relation to the disease @di$ infective endocarditis @/di$ (IE) (Baker et al., ; Crump et al., ). S. sanguinis is a frequent cause of this serious illness, which exhibits a 12%-30% mortality rate (Bor et al., ; Jamil et al., ; Wilson et al., ) and for which the only form of prevention:antibiotic prophylaxis:is controversial (Cahill, Baddour, et al., ; Cahill, Dayer, et al., ). This has led to the investigation of SsaB, the lipoprotein component of the ABC manganese transport system, as a target for @di$ endocarditis @/di$ prevention.	1
Similarly, @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ infections resulted in exophthalmia, hemorrhage, ulceration, fin rot, @di$ lethargy @/di$, loss of scale, skin discoloration, and hemorrhagic/necrotized internal organs in different types of fish.	1
Similarly, Bifidobacterium longum, @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Companilactobacillus crustorum, Latilactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei, and Lactobacillus johnsonii all induce @di$ weight loss @/di$, shown by reduced fat accumulation in HFD-induced obese mice.	2
Similarly, in South-Western Saudi Arabia, Benjamin and Annobil have reported an incidence of leucopenia in 38%, @di$ anemia @/di$ in 64%, and thrombocytopenia in 28% of brucellosis candidates. Many other studies of hematological changes during the active course of brucellosis showed that leukopenia occurred in 33% of patients, @di$ anemia @/di$ in 44%, thrombocytopenia in 5% and pancytopenia in 14%. Furthermore, Mantur BG et al detected pancytopenia in 10% of children suffering brucellosis. The relative frequency of pancytopenia with brucellosis varies from 2% to 14% in previous studies, being relatively higher in adults than in children. The possible mechanisms suggested for pancytopenia include hypersplenism, granuloma formation in the BM, phagocytosis of formed elements by reticuloendothelial cells or BM depression due to associated septicemia. Although @di$ anemia @/di$ in brucellosis is expected to be due to BM involvement, numerous other pathogenetic mechanisms can be (and have been) implicated. Bourantas et al reported that brucellosis induced an autoimmune process, culminating in autoimmune hemolysis. In this study, blood culture was positive for brucellosis in 23 children (21 for @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ and 2 for B.	1
Similarly, oral administration of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, whose presence was found to be lower in IBD patients compared with healthy subjects, attenuated intestinal inflammation in a rat model of @di$ colitis @/di$. While the resolution of obesity-induced intestinal inflammation is a valuable strategy to improve whole-body metabolism, butyrate can also act at the systemic level to exert anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, given the large body of literature supporting the beneficial effects of butyrate, the administration of butyrate producer strains such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, or @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$ may confer predictability and safeness to potential probiotic-based treatments of several pro-inflammatory disorders.	2
Similarly, the NOD1 and NOD2 ligands C12-iE-dap and L18-MDP yielded no @di$ inflammatory @/di$ response in these cells (Fig 1A and 1B). Of a selection of six other Campylobacter species (C. lari, @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$, C.	0
Similarly, the low N availability during the challenge period may have changed the pattern of substrate utilization by @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$. Although @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ ferments lactic acid faster than glucose, this bacterium has been reported to have a greater growth yield on glucose than lactic acid. Combined with the low N availability, a change in substrate fermentation pattern may have also happened in the current study, decreasing the efficacy of @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ on ameliorating @di$ acidosis @/di$ and reducing the undissociated lactic acid load during fermentation.	2
Similarly, the patient in this case had hyponatremia, but @gm$ S. pneumoniae @/gm$ was considered to be the causative agent because of the patient's fever, respiratory infection findings and positive blood culture. Axonal damage, oxidative stress and activation of the immune system are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of MERS. Additionally, local infiltration by inflammatory cells could lead to reduced diffusion on MRI. Similar to our case, @di$ pleocytosis @/di$, a sign of inflammation in the central nervous system, is reported in patients with MERS.	1
Similarly, we showed the effectiveness of Lactobacillus in reduction of symptoms in @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$ patients. Among @di$ lactose intolerance symptoms @/di$, those related to gas production in the gastrointestinal tract including bloating and flatulence, probiotic use was shown to significantly prevent lactose fermentation (Shaukat et al., 2010; de Vrese et al., 2015). Our findings are also in line with these reports demonstrating an improvement in @di$ lactose intolerance symptoms @/di$ and positive changes in hydrogen level detected by HBT after probiotic consumption. There is inconsistency with @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$ consumption in milk showing not to be effective in reduction of gut symptoms in patients with self-reported @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$ (Shaukat et al., 2010).	2
Since @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$-IRFP713 signals were too weak to be identified with MSOT (data not shown), we used near infrared imaging (NIR) to detect @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$-IRFP713 accumulation into melanoma tumor following i.v. injection. We observed that mice injected with @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$-IRFP713 had identifiable signals, whereas the blue color-beta-gal did not demonstrate fluorescent signals (Figure 6b). In the group of mice injected with @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$-IRFP713, we observed background signal underneath the tumor, which we have observed in previous studies using the same NIR settings. These results suggest that @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ had the ability to find and establish preferentially within the tumor @di$ hypoxia @/di$ niches. These findings suggest that @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ represents an attractive agent to target and deliver therapeutic molecules into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.	1
Since many decades, SM is found to be the main pathogen, which causes @di$ dental caries @/di$. Other bacterial species such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and related genera are aciduric and acidogenic species, routinely isolated on acidic culture media, significantly related to @di$ caries @/di$ experience in children. Only limited studies have reported correlating the levels of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and @di$ dental caries @/di$ in children.	1
Since the crystal structure of GS from @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ is not available in the PDB database (https://www.rcsb.org/) at the moment, the construction of the 3D model of GS has become key to subsequent research. The amino acid sequence of @di$ GS @/di$ was retrieved from the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org).	0
Sixty-two samples combined from healthy controls and @di$ obese @/di$ subjects were included. We found 271 correlations with original p values < 0.05 (Spearman's correlation value > 0.25 or < -0.25; q < 0.61) (Suppl. Table 3; Fig. 3d). Among the 6 @di$ obese @/di$ parameters, VFA had the largest number of correlations with bacterial species (n = 26, q < 0.08), followed by waist (n = 24, q < 0.09), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, n = 20, q < 0.11), BMI (n = 18, q < 0.12), hipline (n = 14, q < 0.15) and SFA (n = 11, q < 0.19). C. citroniae, C. symbiosum and E. eligens had the most frequent correlations with the @di$ obese @/di$ parameters (Fig. 3e). Within the species negatively correlated with VFA, E. eligens had the strongest correlation, followed by C. citroniae, C. symbiosum, B. uniformis, E. ventriosum, Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16, C. hathewayi, @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$, and F. plautii. Species negatively correlated with the @di$ obese @/di$ parameters were also frequently and negatively correlated with triglyceride (TG), white blood cell count (WBC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide (FCp), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), while were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL).	2
Skin infections with @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$, predominantly cellulitis, occur through exposure of acute or chronic wounds to saline water. Initially, patients almost always report severe pain in the involved body part. Other skin manifestations are erythematous indurated plaques with haemorrhagic bullae, pustules, petechiae, necrosis and ulcers. To the best of our knowledge, necrotizing fasciitis induced by @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ has been reported rarely in the literature compared to that induced by V. vulnificus. Predisposed to @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ skin infections are individuals with occupational and recreational exposure to fish and shellfish, chronic liver disease or a liver transplant, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, alcohol abuse, splenectomy, immune suppression therapy, cancer chemotherapy and AIDS. These conditions may strongly favour the development of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ septicaemia in 5% of cases, which is much less frequent than sepsis caused by V. vulnificus (> 30% of cases). Symptoms (high fever, chills, @di$ myalgia @/di$ and pain in the lower extremities) occur with an almost abrupt onset within 7-14 days after contact. The rate of mortality from @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ infection is low (3% of cases).	1
Sneathia sanguinegens, Sneathia vaginalis, and @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$ have been recently described in the female genital tract. We present the first case of a postpartum @di$ septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis @/di$ due to these organisms, identified by next generation sequencing.	1
So far, changes in the GM have been shown to be related to @di$ asthma @/di$, pneumonia, lung cancer, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. Some gut microbiomes may therefore be used as biomarkers of lung diseases for therapeutic targeting or to explain the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases. For example, a study has confirmed that @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ and Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplements to COPD-affected mice can reduce alveolar injury and inflammation of the airway.	2
Some @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ strains synthesize toxins, which induce diarrhoea, whereas others may be responsible for causing @di$ nausea @/di$ and vomiting.	1
Some differences in presentation were noted when comparing these results to travelers infected with the same @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi A @/gm$ C5 strain returning from Cambodia to France. In the latter study, the majority of patients did have diarrhea (70.6%) and were hospitalized (86%). This difference may be due to other waterborne or oral-fecal infections travelers frequently contract and/or less financial constrains related to hospital admission. Clinical presentation in the present study also differed from typhoid fever patients in African countries where higher rates of severe complications and mortality are observed. As the same H58 haplotype of Salmonella Typhi is dominant in Asia and in eastern Africa, differences could perhaps be explained by timely access to health care and adequate treatment as well as to host-related factors including underlying co-morbidities like @di$ malnutrition @/di$.	1
Some of them (Eggerthella, Coprobacillus and Oscillospira genera) have been previously described as correlates of biological aging or abundant in elderly individuals (Mogibacteriacaee, Coriobacteriaceae families and Lactobacillus, @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ species). Furthermore, some bacteria seem to be positively correlated also with different nutritional and physical features: Eubacterium dolichum has been associated with @di$ obesity @/di$ and western diet in mice, and Oscillospira genus has been found in high concentrations in the stools of lean subjects.	1
Some of those species are important health promoters such as Akkermansia muciniphila and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$. The first degrades the intestinal mucus and produces substrates locally, such as monosaccharides and acetate, used by other intestinal bacteria through a cross-feeding phenomenon. Akkermansia also plays a role in the gut barrier, immune-modulation, and @di$ obesity @/di$, but was not detected in this donor. The @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus is present in a higher proportion in babies due to their bifidogenic alimentation through milk, and nowadays has an use as probiotic for human health.	2

The @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ genus is present in a higher proportion in babies due to their bifidogenic alimentation through milk, and nowadays has an use as probiotic for human health. This genus was found in a higher proportion in @di$ AC @/di$ compared to the other colons. This is probably due to the saccharolytic substrate availability in this part of the in vitro model, which can be used by these bacteria. No significant quantification variations were shown after the phage treatment in @di$ AC @/di$ and some bacteria were found at the end of the experiment in TC and DC.	0
Some researchers have reported that xylitol and sorbose can significantly promote the production of butyrate in an in vitro fermentation, which was related to an increase in the relative abundance of Anaerostipes hadrus and @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$. Only these two bacteria can produce butyrate derived from sorbose and xylitol among 12 typical butyrate-producing bacteria in the colon. However, further studies have found that the pure culture of Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319 in vitro cannot utilize xylitol, indicating that there exists a cross-feeding system between gut bacteria. Moreover, the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be inhibited by xylitol to prevent @di$ acute otitis media @/di$ in infants and young children, since xylitol cannot be metabolized by it.	2
Some studies have shown that probiotic combination of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species significantly decreases @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, delays the colonic transit, and reduces flatulence. In the current study, pre-treatment with B. longum or @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ strains alone decreases visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress in response to low noxious stimuli, but the combination of these 2 probiotics was more effective in stressed mice at all volumes of CRD. We have observed that the anti-nociceptive effect of probiotics depends on the probiotic strain used. The results have also shown a differential effect with respect to the influence of these different probiotic treatments on releasing plasma levels of stress hormones. Indeed, B. longum strain alone or in combination with @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ strains decreased hypersecretion of corticosterone and catecholamine hormones under stressful conditions. However, the treatment with @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ strain alone does not attenuate stress response in mice. The role of @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ in the combination of probiotics can be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties. A recent study has shown that the @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ strain effect depends on gut inflammatory state and elicits anti-inflammatory responses in intestinal inflammation-associated behaviour. The anti-inflammatory properties of @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ are probably due to its capacity to decrease pathogen adhesion to the epithelial cells. On the other hand, B. longum probiotic strain enhances some positive effects on the cognition by decreasing anxiety in mice. Taking into account the specificity of action of each strain at the peripheral and central level, all these data converge to show that CNS function is positively impacted by the combination of these 2 probiotics (B. longum and @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$).	2
Spearman rank correlation was further employed to analyze the correlation between the relative abundance of the ileal microbiota and the lesion score and @di$ weight loss @/di$, respectively. Among 18 bacterial families and 31 genera that were commonly present in >20% of samples, 16 families and 29 genera showed a significant correlation (FDR<0.05) with the two phenotypic parameters (Figure 4A). While Clostridiaceae/Clostridium and Enterobacteriaceae/Escherichia-Shigella were positively correlated with NE severity, all other bacterial families and genera showed a strong negative correlation. The prevalence of most bacteria, such as Streptococcaceae/Streptococcus, Staphylococcaceae/Staphylococcus, Lactobacillaceae/Lactobacillus, and Oscillospiraceae/@gm$ Subdoligranulum @/gm$ progressively declined along with the severity of NE (Figure 4B).	2
Species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are used as probiotics and consumed for health promotion, although the evidence on their effect on @di$ weight-loss @/di$ has been conflicting. Turicibacter showed an inverse association with BF% (r = -0.66, p = 0.002) and gynoid fat mass (r = 0.51, p = 0.026) and Ruminococcus torques with BF%(r = -0.52, p = 0.019) in YA (Table 7). At Week 12, @gm$ Dorea formicigenerans @/gm$ negatively correlated with AG in OA (r = -0.62, p = 0.01).	2
Species often found in higher relative abundance in @di$ bacterial vaginosis @/di$ (@di$ BV @/di$):@gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, Prevotella spp., Sneathia spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, and Veillonellaceae spp.:were dominant in C. trachomatis-infected women. This combination of @di$ BV @/di$ pathogens was unique to Pacific Islanders compared to previously studied groups. The C. trachomatis-infected endocervix had a higher diversity of microbiota and microbial profiles that were somewhat different from those of the vagina. However, community state type III (CST-III) and CST-IV predominated, reflecting pathogenic microbiota regardless of C. trachomatis infection status. Rectal microbiomes were dominated by Prevotella and Bacteroides, although four women had unique microbiomes with Gardnerella, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Brachyspira. A high level of microbial similarity across microbiomes in two C. trachomatis-infected women suggested intragenitorectal transmission. A number of metabolic pathways in the endocervix, driven by @di$ BV @/di$ pathogens and C.	1
Species-level analyses identified five bacterial species that were significantly associated with the @di$ obese @/di$ group: Blautia hydrogenotorophica, Coprococcus catus, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum (Table 4).	1
Specifically, a decrease in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was seen in patients with @di$ alcohol dependence @/di$, and both clinical and animal studies suggested that restoration of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium could reduce endotoxemia and alcohol-induced liver injury. Furthermore, the loss of Akkermansia was also considered as an early marker of alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis. Patients with @di$ alcohol use disorder @/di$ presented decreased Akkermansia and increased Bacteroides. Consistently, a study found that the decrease of relative abundance of Akkermansia was accompanied by more severe alcoholic liver disease, and the relative abundance of Akkermansia was the lowest in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Oral supplementation of Akkermansia restored the ethanol-induced Akkermansia depletion and alleviated the liver function damage in acute and chronic alcohol-exposed mice. After FMT enema from a donor rich in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, patients with @di$ alcohol use disorder @/di$-related cirrhosis showed decreased alcohol craving and consumption, reduced serious adverse events, and improved cognitive function. Table 2 summarized preclinical studies and clinical trials of gut microbiome-based therapies for ALD. These results suggested that intervention in the gut microbiome, such as @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, is likely to be effective targets to prevent and treat ALD. Interestingly, some bacteria such as Clostridium genus, had been recognized as ethanol-producing bacteria, Clostridium -sensu stricto, -XI, -XVIII, Lactococcus, Turicibacter, and @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ carried the genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, indicating the direct functional ability of gut microbiome in alcohol production and/or metabolism.	2
Specifically, circulating levels of BCAA significantly and independently correlate with @di$ hyperglycemia @/di$, dyslipidemia and coronary artery diseases. Herein, we found that SOE supplementation caused an increase in the abundance of the genus @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$. Interestingly, @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ was previously identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAA and insulin resistance.	1
Specifically, in IBS-C subjects with positive CH4 breath tests, breath CH4 levels were linked to higher stool levels of the methanogenic archaeon @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$, confirmed by both qPCR and sequencing. IBS-C/CH4+ subjects had a distinct gut microtype when compared to IBS-D, characterized by higher RA of the archaeal family Methanobacteriaceae (which includes @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$) that correlated with higher RA of specific H2-producing bacterial families, Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae, which include known syntrophs of @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$. By contrast, IBS-D subjects were characterized by elevated breath levels of H2 and H2S. Breath H2S levels correlated with RA of gut bacterial H2S producers in IBS-D subjects, including genus Fusobacterium and an unknown species from genus Desulfovibrio, and the RA of family Fusobacteriaceae correlated with the RA of the H2-producing family Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, predicted microbial metabolic pathway analysis indicated enrichment of KEGG modules associated with methane production in IBS-C/CH4+ subjects and enrichment of KEGG modules associated with H2S production in IBS-D subjects. These findings suggest that increases in @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and in bacterial H2S producers including Fusobacterium and Desulfovibrio species may contribute to the predominant @di$ constipation @/di$ and diarrheal subtypes in IBS subjects, respectively.	1
Specifically, the first pattern included 18 CKD microbial species; during CKD progression, the levels of four species increased (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii [of the Enterobacteriaceae family belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum], Flavonifractor plautii, and Anaerostipes caccae) and those of 14 species decreased (Methanobrevibacter smithii, Coprococcus comes, Coprococcus eutactus, Clostridium sporogenes, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus bromii, @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Veillonella parvula, Megasphaera elsdenii, Dialister succinatiphilus, Acidaminococcus intestini, Faecalicoccus pleomorphus, and Subdoligranulum variabile, Fig. 2A). The second pattern included eight species. In the mild CKD group, the Megasphaera micronuciformis level increased. In the moderate CKD group, Alistipes indistinctus, Alistipes inops, and Bacteroides uniformis levels decreased (Fig. 2A). In the ESRD group, the Turicibacter sanguinis level increased, but the Streptococcus mutans, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Lactobacillus crispatus levels decreased (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, microbial species, such as F. plautii, C. werkmanii, Ruminococcus spp., @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$, E. rectale, F. prausnitzii, and C. sporogenes, were closely associated with eGFR and serum Alb and Hb levels (Additional Fig. 1B and Additional Table 3). Among all clinical factors, @di$ hypertension @/di$, diabetes, serum albumin, and serum Hb significantly differed among the CKD groups; therefore, they were included as confounders in the multivariate analyses. However, the CCA found no association between CKD severity-related gut microbiome and @di$ hypertension @/di$, diabetes, or the albumin and Hb levels (P = 0.077, Additional Fig.	0

Specifically, there were six ASVs depleted in adenoma, which were assigned as Bifidobacterium longum, Anaerostipes hadrus, @gm$ Lactococcus taiwanensis @/gm$, Aminipila butyrica, etc. Besides, the abundances of 37 ASVs were increased in adenoma compared with control, and they were assigned as Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Methanobrevibacter millerae, Christensenellaceae R-7 group sp., etc (Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, we also identified 114 differentially abundant ASVs between adenoma and @di$ cancer @/di$. Among these, 56 ASVs were in lower abundance in adenoma compared with @di$ cancer @/di$, which were assigned as Lachnoclostridium sp., [Ruminococcus] gnavus group sp., [Clostridium] scindens, Escherichia-Shigella sp., etc. The ASVs in higher abundance in adenoma than @di$ cancer @/di$ were assigned as Blautia obeum, Butyricicoccus faecihominis, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 sp., Dorea longicatena, etc (Supplementary Data 3).	0
"Spirochaetes, particularly Treponema, have been linked to chronic tonsillitis in a Belgian study, and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ is a member of the so-called ""red-complex"" of bacterial species that are strongly associated with periodontitis. Interestingly, Treponema, mostly T. medium and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ were almost exclusively detected in adults, and especially in healthy adults. Porphyromonas gingivalis, which also is part of the ""red-complex"" of subgingival bacteria associated with periodontal disease, was present only in one healthy adult. In contrast, P. catoniae was found in all samples and was together with the yet uncultured Porphyromonas genomospecies PAJ1 which, according to a BLAST search, previously was detected in such diverse habitats as the ileum, the distal esophagus, and the human skin, but also in saliva, subgigival plaque, and in lower respiratory tract samples from @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ patients the only Porphyromonas species detected in children."	0
Sputum cultures yielded @gm$ Mycobacterium kansasii @/gm$ on 3 occasions. A fever of 38 degrees C or higher persisted for about 4 months despite the use of antitubercular agents, including INH, RFP, SM, and PZA. During the course of treatment, the hilar and mediastinal lymph @di$ node @/di$ enlargement became more severe, and this was followed by calcification of the @di$ nodes @/di$.	1
Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$, and a Staphylococcus warneri-like species were the 4 most prevalent CNS species found. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were built to evaluate risk factors for species-specific CNS IMI. Risk factors for Staph. chromogenes IMI were presence in herd B, the period from June 2014 to August 2014 and December 2014 to February 2015, and presence of @di$ udder edema @/di$.	1
Staphylococcus epidermidis, another opportunistic pathogen, is usually part of the normal skin flora of healthy individuals but is also associated with high numbers of catheter or other foreign body related @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$. Of note, not all staphylococci are pathogenic and some have been exploited in food industry and biotechnology. For example, @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$, S.	1
Staphylococcus saprophyticus is an important cause of @di$ urinary tract infection @/di$, and its cell surface hydrophobicity may contribute to virulence by facilitating adherence of the organism to uroepithelia. S. saprophyticus expresses the surface protein SdrI, a member of the serine-aspartate repeat (SD) protein family, which has multifunctional properties. The SdrI knock out mutant has a reduced hydrophobicity index (HPI) of 25%, and expressed in the non-hydrophobic @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$ strain TM300 causes hydrophobicity.	1
Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the isolation rate of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$, concerning forms of the stool and brands of the chicken samples (p value= 0.28). Moreover, no significant difference was detected in the prevalence of Campylobacter infection in patients with exudative @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (11/167, 6.6%), based on the presence of mucus, leukocyte, red blood cell, and epithelial cells in direct microscopic smears, compared with those who presented secretory @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (16/233, 6.9%), and between males (6.4%) and females (7.3%).	0
Stool samples from 30 consecutive patients with AAA before @di$ aneurysm @/di$ repair and those of 30 controls without vascular diseases were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene (V3-4) sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq system and QIIME 2. There was no significant difference in age (75 vs. 75 years) or gender (80% vs. 87% males) between the groups. No significant difference in GM composition was observed in principal coordinate analysis between the two groups, whereas the AAA group showed a significantly lower abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$ (p<0.01) at the species level than the controls. This study demonstrated that the abundance of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ decreased in patients with AAA.	2
Strain D13 decreased the disease activity index (DAI) and altered the gut microbiota of mice with DSS-induced colitis by increasing the ratio of beneficial microbial species (Allobaculum, @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$) and decreasing those associated with @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$ (Candidatus Saccharimonas).	2
Strains of the @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ serotype harboring the Stx2-encoding phage received little notice until a stx2-positive EAggEC (StxEAggEC) strain caused a large outbreak centered in Germany and a small outbreak in France. In all, 16 countries in Europe and North America reported a total of 4075 cases and 50 deaths. @di$ Hemolytic-uremic syndrome @/di$ (@di$ HUS @/di$) was a frequent complication of the illness in these outbreaks, occurring in 22% of the reported illnesses. The source of the O104:H4 infection in Germany and France was traced to sprouts derived from fenugreek seeds that had been imported into Europe from Egypt in 2009. Early results indicated that the 2011 outbreak strain of @gm$ E. coli O104:H4 @/gm$, while expressing the Shiga toxin typical of enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) strains, shared features of enteroaggregative (EAggEC or EAEC) strains.	1
Streptococcus mutans cells form robust biofilms on human teeth and are strongly related to @di$ caries @/di$ incidents. Hence, understanding the adhesion of S. mutans in the human oral cavity is of major interest for preventive dentistry. In this study, we report on atomic force microscopy-based single-cell force spectroscopy measurements of S. mutans cells to hydroxyapatite surfaces. We observe for almost all measurements a significant difference in adhesion strength for S. mutans as well as for @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$ cells. However, the increase in adhesion strength after saliva exposure is much higher for S. mutans cells compared to @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ cells. Our results demonstrate that S. mutans cells are well adapted to their natural environment, the oral cavity. This ability promotes the biofilm-forming capability of that species and hence the production of @di$ caries- @/di$provoking acids. In consequence, understanding the fundamentals of this mechanism may pave a way towards more effective @di$ caries @/di$-reducing techniques.	0
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Hemophilus influenzae B, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) are among the most common agents of @di$ bacterial meningitis @/di$ in the US, along with Group B Streptococcus and Listeria monocytogenes (Schuchat et al.,). Mycobacterium tuberculosis, @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ (the agent of syphilis), the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, Rickettsiae and others may cause meningitis and/or encephalitis, while Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are common causative agents of brain abscesses (Garg et al.,; Bartzatt,; Beckham and Tyler,).	1
Studies also have shown that DBP adversely impacts the development of the immune system and the nervous system, and can cause adult @di$ weight gain @/di$, obesity, and diabetes. Currently, DBP-degrading bacteria include Enterobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, Paracoccus, and @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$.	0
Studies based on genetic variety in @di$ UC @/di$ patients did not show any significant gene-variety linked to @di$ UC @/di$, but Human Leukocytes antigen (HLA) class II genes DR2 and DR9 are linked to @di$ UC @/di$, while DRB1*0103 is significantly associated with disease susceptibility and increased risk of colectomy. TNF-alpha is identified as a susceptibility locus for @di$ UC @/di$. Therefore, biological agents as anti-TNF- alpha antibodies/TNF- alpha antagonists are used to neutralize TNF-alpha and reduce the inflammation in @di$ UC @/di$ patients with severe disease. Reduced production of Melatonin hormone is linked to @di$ UC @/di$, which might be the cause of depression and anxiety in @di$ UC @/di$ patients. Melatonin in GI tract is produced by enterochromaffin cells (EC), which are located in epithelial layer of GIT. Melatonin has an immunoregulatory effect, exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components. Melatonin reduces certain opportunistic pathogen bacterial genera such as Desulfovibrio, Peptococcaceae, and increases the abundance of beneficial genera such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$. Melatonin upregulates the major mucin MUC2 to maintain intestinal integrity. Therefore, Melatonin therapy might be beneficial in @di$ UC @/di$ patients.	2
Studies have shown the health benefits of specific probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Saccharomyces, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Bacillus, Escherichia coli.  Although the activating mechanism of many probiotics has been identified, there are ongoing research studies to understand other mechanisms and their effects on various diseases. For instance, the effect of probiotics on @di$ diarrhea @/di$,  cholesterol absorption,  and lactose sensitivity  has been demonstrated.	2
Subsequently, we demonstrated that nifedipine increases host resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterium @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium @/gm$ (@gm$ S.tm @/gm$.) by limiting iron access to microbes within macrophages, resulting in a bacteriostatic effect. Nifedipine is used mainly as an antihypertensive and antianginal drug. It inhibits the entry of calcium ions by blocking voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes. Reduction of intracellular calcium decreases peripheral arterial vascular resistance and results in dilation of coronary arteries. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in systemic blood pressure and increased oxygen supply to the myocardium. The plasma concentrations achieved have been described as 115 +/- 7 ng/mL. The most common adverse effects include flushing, peripheral edema, @di$ dizziness @/di$ and headache.	0
Surgical intervention is required in most cases of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$-infected aneurysms due to the high mortality rate ranging between 75 % and 100 %, resulting from @di$ aneurysmal rupture @/di$ in patients undergoing only medical treatment for infected aneurysms.	1
Surprisingly, the rate of ocular infection in clodronate-treated larvae remained consistently higher than in the controls, even beyond 3 dpi, when the @gm$ Mm @/gm$ crosses the BRB (Figure 4D). The mean percentage of larvae with eye infection in the clodronate-treated group (49.98 +- 9.57) was significantly higher than in the control group (38.73 +- 8.46) after 6 dpi (p < 0.03, Student's t-test). However, the rate of @di$ granuloma @/di$ formation amongst infected larvae was marginally lower in the clodronate-treated group (8%, two of 25 larvae) compared to the control group (14.3%, four of 28 larvae). We expect that the lack of contribution from circulating macrophages could be responsible for the lower rate of @di$ granuloma @/di$ formation.	1
Swine are the most important animal reservoir of @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$, which is shed by infected animals in faeces, urine, saliva and nasal secretions. Our patient worked with transportation of swine cadavers, and thus, he had an occupational risk for such infections. We know that 20-40% of healthy swine harbour this pathogen in their lymphoid tissue of the alimentary tract, particularly in the tonsils. Infections caused by @gm$ E. rhusiopathiae @/gm$ are strongly related to the occupation of the patient and almost 90% of patients with @di$ endocarditis @/di$ due to this pathogen have an occupational risk of infection.	1
Syphilis is a bacterial multisystem infection caused by the spirochete @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$. Ocular involvement occurs in about 0.6-2% of all the patients with syphilis, at any stage of disease . The most common presentation of ocular syphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients is posterior uveitis, whereas panuveitis is the predominant diagnosis in HIV-positive patients . Other ocular findings described in syphilis include conjunctivitis, @di$ interstitial keratitis @/di$, episcleritis, scleritis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, papillitis, perineuritis, retrobulbar neuritis, neuroretinitis, optic atrophy, optic nerve gumma and various types of stroke syndromes [-].	1
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$. The primary stage of the disease manifests as a @di$ chancre @/di$.	1
TC and TG are the main components of blood lipids; lowering their concentrations can prevent @di$ hyperlipemia @/di$. Considerable researches have confirmed that consumption of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ products reduced concentrations of serum cholesterol and improved lipid profiles. In the current study, dietary addition of @gm$ L. delbrueckii @/gm$ decreased serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG of pigs. Our findings were again the proof of our previous reports and also offered another evidence for cholesterol-lowering role of lactic acid bacteria in normal subject. The hypocholesterolemic effect of @gm$ L. delbrueckii @/gm$ might provide a potential dietary manipulation way to prevent and improve @di$ hyperlipidemia @/di$.	2
TMPRSS2 is responsible for the TcsH-induced colonic epithelial lesions, as most of the pathological features, including @di$ mucosal edema @/di$, epithelium integration, and inflammatory cell infiltration, are reduced in the Tmprss2-/- mice compared to the WT mice. Because intestinal lumens are major locations where @gm$ P. sordellii @/gm$ colonizes in humans, TcsH actions may benefit the bacterium by damaging the colonic epithelium to gain additional nutrients.	1
TSLS with @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ has been documented in bone marrow transplantation, neutropenic, cancer and chemotherapy patients. However, the occurrence of TSLS with @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ in previously healthy adults is rare. Madhusudhan et al. described a previously healthy 33-year-old woman with a history of 2 days of feeling lethargic and unwell, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, necrotizing fasciitis and @di$ hypotension @/di$. Finally, the patient was successfully treated with imipenem/cilastatin and clindamycin, aggressive intensive care support, renal replacement therapy by veno-venous filtration, and so on. In China, there was an outbreak of TSLS with @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ in previously healthy adults in 1990. In this case, approximately half of the patients presented with symptoms or signs of streptococcal TSLS characterized by @di$ hypotension @/di$ and multiorgan failure.	1
Table 2 presents demographic and clinical characteristics for @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$. A somewhat higher proportion of patients reporting 'only clam' consumption reported any pre-existing condition (43% in patients with 'only clam' consumption vs. 34% with 'no clam'), notably with @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ (12% vs.	0
Table 4 Species categorized in the two levels of evidence - Strong or Moderate - for the status of '@di$ periodontal pathogen @/di$'. Eight species were included in the Strong evidence category (L. rimae, C. sakazakii, E gergoviae, E. faecalis, @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$, F.	1
Taking into account that cxcr3.3 mutant macrophages move faster and are recruited more efficiently to sites of infection, we wanted to know whether the enhanced motility of macrophages in cxcr3.3 mutants could facilitate bacterial dissemination by accelerating @di$ granuloma @/di$ formation and seeding of secondary @di$ granulomas @/di$. We addressed our question by locally injecting @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ into the hindbrain of WT, cxcr3.2, and cxcr3.3 mutants at 28 hpf and by assessing the percentage of infected larvae that developed distal @di$ granulomas @/di$ at 4 dpi (Fig. 8A), as well as the number and size of such @di$ granulomas @/di$ in each group (Figs. 8C and D). Our data show that cxcr3.3 mutant larvae more frequently developed distal @di$ granulomas @/di$ (22%) than the other 2 groups (Fig. 8A). In addition, the average number of the distal @di$ granulomas @/di$ per fish within this group was higher (Fig. 8C) and the quantified structures were also larger (Fig. 8D). Consistent with previous work,29 a small proportion of cxcr3.2 mutant larvae (5%) developed fewer and smaller distal @di$ granulomas @/di$ compared with the wild type (12.7%). Our data suggest that cxcr3.3 mutant macrophages favor bacterial dissemination and the seeding of secondary @di$ granulomas @/di$ due to their enhanced recruitment to sites of infection and their higher speed.	1
The 3 Enterobacterales species most frequently isolated from @di$ UTI @/di$, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, were very susceptible to ceftibuten-avibactam, with 98.5% to 99.7% of isolates inhibited at <= 1 mg/L (Table 1). Indole-positive Proteeae were also highly susceptible to ceftibuten-avibactam (MIC50/90, <= 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2% inhibited at <= 1 mg/L and <= 8 mg/L), while @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ species complex isolates exhibited slightly higher ceftibuten-avibactam MIC values (MIC50/90, 0.12/4 mg/L; 73.8%/96.8% inhibited at <= 1/ <= 8 mg/L) than those other Enterobacterales species (Table 1).	1
The 6 dominant bacterial EV genera in the indoor dust from apartments were Pseudomonas, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Enterobacteriaceae (f), Streptophyta (o), Erwinia and Staphylococcus. However, Streptophyta (o) EVs were hard to analyze at lower taxonomic levels. Moreover, although abundant Erwinia EVs were detected in both the apartment samples, they had low abundance in the hospital samples. Therefore, we selected 4 bacterial EVs for further analysis: Pseudomonas, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$, Enterobacter and Staphylococcus. These bacterial targets are known for their association with allergic disorders such as @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$ and asthma.	1
The @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence was calculated for each streptococcal risk group and is presented relative to the number of positive blood culture bottles, and @di$ IE @/di$ risk factors (Table 2). Low-risk streptococci (S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. intermedius) had an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 0.5-1.5%, unless they had >=3 positive blood culture bottles and at least one further risk factor in which case @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence was 6.9% [95% CI: 3.4-12.3%]. Moderate-risk streptococci (S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. dysgalactiae, S. salivarius, and S. thermophilus) had an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 1.5% [95% CI: 0.9-2.4%] if they neither had a risk factor nor >=3 positive blood culture bottles, but an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 3-10% if they had either >=3 positive blood culture bottles (@di$ IE @/di$ prevalence 9.6% [95% CI: 7.5-12.1%]) or a risk factor (@di$ IE @/di$ prevalence 8.7% [95% CI: 4.4-15.1%]). Moderate-risk streptococci presenting with both >=3 positive blood culture bottles and a risk factor had an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 31.1% [95% CI: 23.3-39.7%]. High-risk streptococci (S. mitis/oralis, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, and G. adiacens) had an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 3.6% [95% CI: 1.9-6.0%]) if they neither had a risk factor nor >=3 positive blood culture bottles, but an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 14.0% [95% CI: 5.3-27.9%] if they presented a risk factor and < 3 positive blood culture bottles and an @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 48.4% [95% CI: 40.4-56.5%] if they had >=3 positive blood culture bottles. Finally, very high-risk streptococci (S. gordonii, S. gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis), S. mutans, and S. sanguinis) had a very high baseline @di$ IE @/di$ prevalence of 35.7% [95% CI: 31.5-40.1%] (Table 2).	1
The @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ tested were expressed at various levels in the study and in the control group (Table 2). C. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis were the most abundant species in the study group, while the control group showed the highest count of P. intermedia, then C. gingivalis, and no P. gingivalis. E. nodatum from yellow-orange-associated complex was not detected in the subjects of the study. From the detectable species, the least abundant was A. actinomycetemcomitans. T. denticola, @gm$ P. micros @/gm$, and orange complex bacteria were significantly more often isolated in the control group. Subjects with moderate gingivitis had significantly higher levels of all species from red complex and @gm$ P. micros @/gm$, and significantly higher percentage of subjects infected by red complex bacteria and T.	1
The @di$ swelling @/di$ of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of Bifidobacterium infantis. Actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. Mortality and @di$ thigh swelling @/di$ were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$. High (less than 75%) rate of @di$ thigh swelling @/di$ was also encountered in case of Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides corrodens, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium plauti, Peptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus intermedius, Eubacterium lentum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ss.	1
The @di$ syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone @/di$ has been associated with many pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis and bacterial and viral pneumonia: however, it has not been reported with anaerobic infections or empyema in the absence of pneumonia. We report a patient with empyema due to @gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus who developed the syndrome. Eight hours before the start of therapy, his serum sodium concentration was 127 mEq per liter; serum osmolality, 255 mOsm per kg; urine osmolality, 522 mOsm per kg; urinary sodium concentration, 39 mEq per liter. The creatinine clearance and the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test were normal, and there was no evidence of dehydration. No other causes of the @di$ syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone @/di$ were apparent. With drainage and antimicrobial drug therapy, the empyema cleared, and the syndrome resolved in 8 days. The patient has been well, without evidence of @di$ inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone @/di$, for 9 months. Anaerobic infections and/or empyema without pneumonia can be associated with the @di$ syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone @/di$.	1
The @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp. are gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that cause brucellosis, which afflicts over 500,000 people annually and severely damages animal production. At present, the genus @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ contains 10 species, among which four species (Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Brucella abortus, and @gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$) are thought to be pathogenic to humans. Moreover, B. melitensis, B. suis, and B. abortus are also the main causes of human brucellosis due to their highly contagious characteristics and are listed as potential bioweapons by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These organisms cause abortion, infertility, and low milk production in their natural hosts (bovines, goats, and sheep), whereas the common manifestations of human infection include undulant @di$ fever @/di$, arthralgia, asthenia, depression, and lymphadenopathy; therefore, these organisms pose a substantial threat to livestock production, food safety, and human health.	1
The @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ genus exhibits high butyrate production by breaking down indigestible carbohydrates. Notably, most @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ strains were initially isolated from human fecal samples, and in healthy adults, Roseburia spp. account for approximately 3%-15% of the total bacterial counts in feces. Moreover, fecal samples collected from 40 pairs of twin cohorts showed the disappearance of Roseburia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Roseburia intestinalis, the most well-known species in @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ genus, shows various immunomodulatory functions by decreasing proinflammatory cytokine IFNr and IL-17 production and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-22 under IBD-associated @di$ dysbiosis @/di$. Ruan et al. demonstrated the possibility of R. intestinalis as a therapeutic agent in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis model. R. faecis, another strain in the @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ genus, produces bacteriocin-like substance (BLIS) in vitro, which is a type of abtibiotic produced by certain microorganisms that inhibits the growth of the same or related species.	2
The @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ genus contains three pathogenic species, i.e., Y. pestis, @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$, and Y. enterocolitica, which cause fatal infections to human beings. Of these, Y. enterocolitica and @gm$ Y. pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ are responsible for Yersiniosis, a self-limiting infection. The bacilli responsible for Yersiniosis are passed on through oral or fecal routes mainly from water, soil, and food. The symptoms of Yersiniosis are typically mesenteric lymphadenitis, mild @di$ diarrhea @/di$, acute gastroenteritis, and reactive arthritis.	1
The @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ high-pathogenicity island (HPI) is common to multiple virulence strategies used by Escherichia coli strains associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). Among the genes in this island are ybtP and ybtQ, encoding distinctive ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins associated with iron(III)-yersiniabactin import in @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ In this study, we compared the impact of ybtPQ on a model E. coli cystitis strain during in vitro culture and experimental murine infections. A ybtPQ-null mutant exhibited no growth defect under standard culture conditions, consistent with nonessentiality in this background. A growth defect phenotype was observed and genetically complemented in vitro during iron(III)-yersiniabactin-dependent growth. Following inoculation into the bladders of C3H/HEN and C3H/HeOuJ mice, this strain exhibited a profound, 10(6)-fold competitive infection defect in the subgroup of mice that progressed to high-titer @di$ bladder infections @/di$. These results identify a virulence role for YbtPQ in the highly inflammatory microenvironment characteristic of high-titer cystitis. The profound competitive defect may relate to the apparent selection of @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ HPI-positive E.	1
The Aeromonas infection-related disease spectrum in humans has expanded; it now includes acute gastroenteritis, @di$ bacteremia @/di$, pancreatitis, hepatobiliary-tract infections, soft-tissue infections, indwelling-device-related infections, brain abscesses, meningitis, endocarditis, pleuropulmonary infections, peritonitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The most common underlying conditions known to be associated with @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ bacteremia are malignancy and hepatobiliary diseases. @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. tend to produce at least three ss-lactamases, namely a penicillinase, cephalosporinase, and carbapenemase, which are all chromosome-encoded. Nevertheless, to date, antibiotic resistance has not been a major problem for strains isolated from the environment. In contrast, clinical studies of Aeromonas infections are relatively rare, and the relevant antibiotic susceptibility profile, accordingly, remains vague. Previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors; however, those studies considered only a few risk factors and resistance to a limited number of antimicrobials. @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis or malignancy has been found to be associated with a higher mortality rate than @di$ bacteremia @/di$ caused by other organisms. The present study is the largest retrospective clinical investigation to analyze various data on monomicrobial @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ bacteremia.	1
The Allegheny County Health Department Pennsylvania, US, advocates environmental monitoring for @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ in hospital's WDS together with @di$ pneumonia @/di$ surveillance. The CDC strategy proposes intensive clinical surveillance without routine environmental surveillance, except in Transplant Units. Italian guidelines for prevention and control of legionellosis set intervention threshold levels for WDS based on the @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ load detected in water samples. It is noteworthy that the presence of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ in a hospital's WDS does not necessarily lead to legionellosis. Conversely, a negative result is no guarantee that @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ is not present in the system.	1
The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) and @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ are opportunistic pathogens that most commonly infect persons with @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ or compromised immune systems. Members of the Burkholderia genus are intrinsically multidrug resistant (MDR), possessing both a PenA carbapenemase and an AmpC beta-lactamase, rendering treatment of infections due to these species problematic. Here, we tested the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination imipenem-relebactam against a panel of MDR Bcc and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ strains. The addition of relebactam to imipenem dramatically lowered the MICs for Bcc and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$: only 16% of isolates tested susceptible to imipenem, while 71.3% were susceptible to the imipenem-relebactam combination. While ceftazidime-avibactam remained the most potent combination drug against this panel of Bcc and @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ strains, imipenem-relebactam was active against 71.4% of the ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant isolates.	1
The Gram-negative CF pathogens were more prevalent in the lung microbiomes of PI than in those of @di$ PS @/di$ patients. Conversely, the constituents of a healthy lung flora, i.e., Veillonella, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$, and Streptococcus species were more common in @di$ PS @/di$ than in PI lungs. These findings confirm the registry data based on culture-dependent diagnostics showing that the amount of CFTR activity is the key determinant for the microbial colonization of CF lungs; i.e., PI patients carry CFTR mutation genotypes which confer null or minimal CFTR activity, whereas @di$ PS @/di$ patients harbor CFTR genotypes which confer some residual CFTR activity, about 10 to 20% of wild type.	2
"The Gram-negative bacilli Serratia spp., Providencia spp., Morganella morganii, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ complex, Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella aerogenes (also named as ""SPICE"" organisms) are common Enterobacterales that may harbor inducible chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase genes. Often, the AmpC beta-lactamase genes are initially suppressed, but exposure to antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum cephalosporins, can induce their expression. Hyperproduced/derepressed AmpC beta-lactamase can inactivate third-generation cephalosporins, most penicillins, and some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. SPICE organisms can cause a variety of severe, mostly hospital-acquired infections, including bloodstream infection (BSI), urinary tract infection, @di$ pneumonia @/di$, biliary and abdominal infection, surgical site infection and device-associated infection."	1
The Gram-negative bacterium  @gm$ Legionella @/gm$  is the causative organism of Legionnaire's disease (LD), which usually presents as a @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and Pontiac fever (PF), which is a milder form, mimicking the symptoms of influenza. Each year, there are approximately just over 500 cases of LD reported in England and Wales, whereas in the USA, there are approximately 10 000 cases each year, with a case fatality rate of 10 %.  @gm$ Legionella @/gm$  are opportunistic bacterial pathogens which are predominantly associated with human-made building water systems, and infection occurs where residents or others associated with  @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ -positive water systems within the housing breathe in small droplets of contaminated water that contains  @gm$ Legionella @/gm$  organisms. Showers and showerheads provide ideal environments for  @gm$ Legionella @/gm$  proliferation and exposure and have often been proposed as a source of sporadic, community-acquired legionellosis, especially if the water has been allowed to stagnate in the showerhead, due to periods of inactivity and lack of use.	1
The Gram-positive bacterium @gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ asymptomatically colonizes the upper respiratory tract, such as the tonsils and nasal cavity of pigs. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ can also cause respiratory disease and serious systemic diseases, such as arthritis, septicemia, @di$ meningitis @/di$, endocarditis, and even sudden death. For these reasons, @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is responsible for significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Zoonotic @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infections can occur and are thought to be preventable and acquired from infected pigs, either due to occupational exposure or by handling and/or consuming undercooked pork products. The prevalence of human @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infections is highest in East and Southeast Asia. Two large outbreaks occurred in China in 1998 and 2005, resulting in 229 human cases with 52 deaths reported, which caused a serious public health concern. Thirty-five serotypes of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ have been identified based on antigenic differences in their capsular polysaccharide; however, only a limited number are responsible for infections in pigs, including serotypes 1 to 9 and 14. Serotype 2 is considered to be the most pathogenic and is the most frequently isolated serotype from both diseased swine and humans. Despite a significant impact on swine health, economic losses incurred by the swine industry, and its zoonotic potential, the virulence mechanisms of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ are poorly understood.	1
The LEfSe analysis revealed a significant increase in the abundance of the species @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium_sp_CAG_180, Bacteroides intestinalis, Roseburia faecis, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Firmicutes_bacterium_AM55_24TS, Coprococcus eutactus, Megamonas funiformis, Lachnospira pectinoschiz, Firmicutes_bacterium_CAG_65, Megamonas hypermegale, and Eubacterium_sp_CAG_581 in the @di$ ASD @/di$ group compared to that in the TD group. Meanwhile, the @di$ ASD @/di$ group showed a significant decrease in the abundance of Veillonella parvula, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$_coprocola_CAG_162, Eubacterium siraeum, Eubacterium_sp_CAG_248, Eubacterium_sp_CAG_202, Bacteroide stercoris, Bacteroides plebeius, and Bacteroides dorei (Figure 5).	1
The MONALISA group report confirmed that 82% of pregnant women faced severe consequences (88/107), such as fetal loss (25%, 27/107), @di$ premature birth before @/di$ 32 gestational weeks (19% in the maternal group and 42% in all premature neonates); moreover, there were also some newborns with early-onset or late-onset listeriosis. Furthermore, although accepting proposals for preemptive ampicillin treatment for maternal fever, the incidence of fetal loss associated with @gm$ LM @/gm$ has not reduced over the recent years.	1
The MiG revealed the presence of bacterial dysbiosis in @di$ gout @/di$ patients. In the network of MGS, Bacteroides caccae (n = 7) and @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ (n = 4) were enriched in @di$ gout @/di$ patients. In past studies, Bacteroides caccae was recognized one biomarker of IBD, and the OmpW protein produced by B. caccae was a target of the IBD-associated immune response, thus the enriched intestinal B. caccae in @di$ gout @/di$ patients could potentially induce serious inflammatory response. @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$ strains isolated from feces of human and other animals was considered to have no virulence and be safe for food use. Significant depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii which was reported to have anti-inflammatory properties and contribute to gut health through butyrate production was observed for @di$ gout @/di$ patients, potentially explaining the decline in butyric acid biosynthesis in @di$ gout @/di$ patients. Protective mechanisms of butyric acid in human intestine include providing the nutrition for intestinal mucosa, promoting the growth and repairing of intestinal villus, enhancing the intestinal immunity, facilitating the growth of beneficial microbes and inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria, thus decline in butyric acid biosynthesis can cause a number of physiological disorders in the host. On the other hand, the microbial xanthine dehydrogenase which can degrade the purine to uric acid was enriched in the @di$ gout @/di$ patients whereas the microbial allantoinase that degrades the uric acid to the urea was depleted in gut patients. Thus, another possible link between activity of intestinal microbiota and @di$ gout @/di$ pathogenesis might be that the overly abundant xanthine dehydrogenase and the relative deficiency of allantoinase in the intestinal microbiota might have accumulated more uric acid and consequently aggravated the @di$ gout @/di$ symptoms.	1
The OF (pre- and postcultivated for 48 h), @di$ IF @/di$ and maternal fecal (MF) samples from 15 families were plated onto TOS propionate agar for colony formation under anaerobic conditions to isolate Bifidobacterium strains. We isolated a total of 888 colonies, and all colonies were subjected to random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis to differentiate the same strains from the same samples. Furthermore, the strains selected as representatives were confirmed to be bifidobacteria using specific primers for Bifidobacterium (Supplemental Table 2). Consequently, a total of 82 strains were obtained and subjected to genome sequencing. Among them, similar strains from the same subject were excluded using the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) based on the ORF content. Finally, 48 Bifidobacterium strains were obtained from the OF (18 strains from 10 subjects), @di$ IF @/di$ (21 strains from 12 subjects) and MF (9 strains from 3 subjects) samples. B. breve (16) was the dominant strain, followed by @gm$ B. longum @/gm$ (11), B.	0
The REBA @di$ Sepsis @/di$-ID test was performed according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. The membrane used in the REBA @di$ Sepsis @/di$-ID test contained DNA probes for GPB, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Mycobacterium spp.; DNA probes for GNB including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii; DNA probes for Candida species including C.	0
The ST29C4 strains also exhibited high similarity in stx2a-prophage and integrase with the @gm$ O104:H4 @/gm$ strain, further demonstrating its potential risk to human health. Collectively, the large-scale phylogenetic analysis extends the understanding of the clonal structure of O26 strains and provides new insights for O26 strain microevolution. IMPORTANCE Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26 is the second prevalent STEC serogroup only to O157, which can cause a series of diseases ranging from mild @di$ diarrhea @/di$ to life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).	1
The Sutterellaceae family, which belongs to the Burkholderiales order and Betaproteobacteria class, was positively correlated with @di$ nausea @/di$. Similarly, the Proteobacteria phylum, Bacteroides species (OTU 204), and Oscillibacter species (OTU 259) were also positively correlated with burping, whereas unclassified Coriobacteriaceae were positively correlated with transit time. Conversely, @gm$ Ruminococcus callidus @/gm$ and Clostridium IV species were negatively correlated with intestinal symptoms and especially discomfort, whereas unclassified Burkholderiales were negatively correlated with rumbling (Figure 4C).	2
The abundance of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ has been found to be reduced in many disease states. Studies on metabolic disorders, such as @di$ obesity @/di$ and diabetes, have given the most promising evidence on the beneficial effect of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ on health. Everard et al. noticed that a daily treatment with live @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ restored the mucus layer thickness in mice on a high-fat diet (HF diet) and reversed the HF diet-induced metabolic disorders. The bacterium also contributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides in the colon as it was found to affect RegIIIgamma production. Furthermore, administration of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ increased the number of mucin-producing goblet cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg) in mice fed with HF-diet. More recently, the bacterium was shown to protect against atherosclerosis in an Apoe-/- mouse model by attenuating metabolic endotoxemia-induced inflammation through restoration of the gut barrier. In vitro results showing that @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ adheres to intestinal epithelial cell lines and strengthens the cell monolayer support the idea that the bacterium has a special barrier fortifying function in the epithelium. @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ also induces only a low-level proinflammatory stimulation (IL-8) in enterocytes as compared to E. coli, which may be beneficial to the gut health as it keeps the immune system alerted. Extracellular vesicles of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ were also found to have a positive effect on intestinal integrity, and due to their small size they may also reach gut epithelium in places where the mucus layer is firm and impermeable to bacteria.	2
The abundance of @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ notably increased to 4.42% in the gut of mice receiving probiotic (high-dose) plus postbiotics (Fig. 4c). Several beneficial functions of @gm$ L. johnsonii @/gm$ have been reported, including thickened mucous membranes in stomach ulcers, restored numbers of serum IgA, IgG, and CD8 + cells, increased splenocyte counts in aged mice with @di$ protein-energy malnutrition @/di$, decreased glucagon and glucose levels in diabetic rats, and prevention of memory dysfunction.	2
The abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis was decreased while @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$ was increased after transplantation (Fig. 4n, o, q). Furthermore, the abundances of Bacteroides acidifaciens, Alloprevotella rava, Alistipes onderdonkii, and Saccharibacteria were increased in transplanted mice (Fig. 4q and Supplementary Fig. 5f-i). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that intestinal microbiota transplanted from 6 M to 2 M mice significantly increased the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella dentalis @/gm$ as well as decreased the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis and thus exacerbated @di$ psoriasis @/di$-like skin phenotype and increased the infiltration of Th17 cells into the ear.	1
The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, for example, Roseburia intestinalis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, are decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes, while conditional pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, some Clostridium species, Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ are enriched. Due to the increased intestinal permeability in type 2 diabetes, gut microbial products can translocate into the blood, resulting in @di$ metabolic endotoxemia @/di$. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key mediator of @di$ endotoxemia @/di$, can activate an inflammatory response through the toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (TLR4/MyD88) signaling pathway.	1
The abundance of genus @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ was negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure in obese and overweight pregnant women, suggesting that SCFA-producing taxa could have an influence on the host blood pressure. Interestingly, Odoribacter seems to be associated with metabolic health benefits coupled with Akkermansia based on previous studies on metabolism-related pathologies, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and @di$ diabetes @/di$. In a twin study, SCFA-producing genera Akkermansia and @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$ were enriched in healthy individuals compared to adults with metabolic syndrome.	2
The acute and chronic recipient livers follow a slightly different @di$ granuloma @/di$ pattern (Figure 3I-P). The splenocytes transferred from the acutely infected spleen are already primed to respond to @gm$ Brucella @/gm$, which is observed in the @di$ granuloma @/di$ response. Surprisingly, the cells transferred from the chronic infection mimic the acute transferred cells. The @di$ granuloma @/di$ size (Figure 5) appeared to increase faster than the primary infection while the number of @di$ granulomas @/di$ (Figure 6) stay more consistent throughout the infection. Even though the @di$ granuloma @/di$ size appears to be larger at an earlier data point versus the uninfected cells, it is not statistically significant.	1
The aim of our study was to investigate the role of the bacterial nuclease SsnA and the host DNase 1 during @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ meningitis in vivo and in vitro. Bacteria developed nucleases in evolutionary biology for phage defense. Since the principle of defense by DNA destruction was very effective, it can be hypothesized that it was also adopted by mammalian cells or perhaps even transferred from bacteria into these cells by endosymbiosis; for example, mitochondrial endonuclease G, which has homologous nucleases in bacteria. Homologous nucleases of SsnA also occur in other bacterial species such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus anthracis, Vibrio cholerae or Aeromonas hydophila. In in vitro experiments, SsnA is described as a NET evasion factor and the strongest phenotype was found with human neutrophils. Most @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ field isolates found in inner organs of pigs express SsnA; therefore, we analyzed if SsnA is necessary to cause meningitis in piglets in vivo. Two independent infection studies with piglets showed that the SsnA mutant was as virulent as the wild-type strain (Figure 1 and Figure S2). Several animals in both infection groups from the early phase experiment developed clinical signs of CNS disorders between 48 h and 96 h post-infection. In addition, @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ strains were re-isolated from different inner organs of piglets without CNS disorders (Tables S3 and S6). In these piglets, bacteria breached the mucosal barrier and caused @di$ bacteremia @/di$.	1
The aim of the present study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of this formulation against the pathogens which are commonly implicated in @di$ periodontal infections @/di$. Films showed sustained release in vitro for a period of 16 days. In situ release studies carried out using fresh bovine buccal mucosa in a flow through cell, showed that drug concentrations were maintained above MIC values for the entire period of the release studies. Samples from these studies were capable of inhibiting the growth of most of the test strains. The combination of amoxycillin and metronidazole using carrier polymer poly-L (lactide co-glycolide) not only showed an extended spectrum of antimicrobial activity but also showed a synergistic effect against @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$, which had earlier been reported resistant to metronidazole.	1
The aim of the present study was to determine the inhibitory effects and the potential underlying mechanisms of a novel Pleurotus eryngii beta-type glycosidic polysaccharide (WPEP) on @di$ colitis @/di$. To achieve this, sixty CD-1 (ICR) mice were divided into six groups including healthy and colitic mice treated with or without WPEP at two different doses (n = 10). The results showed that WPEP displayed a significant inhibitory effect on @di$ colitis @/di$ as indicated by the lowered disease activity index in the treated colitic mice compared to the untreated colitic mice (2.78 +- 0.50 to 1.80 +- 0.17). A decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and pro-inflammatory protein expressions and an increase in the colon length (9.31 +- 0.59 cm to 10.89 +- 1.20 cm) along with histological improvements were also observed in the treated colitic mice compared to the untreated colitic mice in the present study. Flow cytometry and western blotting analysis revealed that these anti-@di$ colitis @/di$ effects were associated with decreased accumulation of CD45+ immune cells, CD45 + F4/80+ macrophages and CD45 + Gr1+ neutrophils. Moreover, the 16s rRNA sequencing analysis of the gut microbiota revealed that WPEP partially reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis in the colitic mice including the decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (35.80 +- 9.10% to 18.24 +- 6.23%) and Clostridium cocleatum (2.34 +- 1.78% to 0.011 +- 0.003%) and the increased abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (3.48 +- 2.72% to 9.65 +- 3.74%), Lactobacillus reuteri (0.007 +- 0.002% to 0.21 +- 0.12%), Lactobacillus salivarius (1.23 +- 0.87% to 2.22 +- 1.53%) and @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ (0.009 +- 0.001% to 3.83 +- 1.98%). In summary, our results demonstrated that WPEP could be utilized as a functional food component in @di$ colitis @/di$ management as well as a potential prebiotic agent to improve inflammation-related disorders.	2
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on the composition and function of the gut microbiota in dogs with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$. Forty dogs with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ were randomly allocated to the treatment group or control group. Probiotics, containing Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P-8, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9, were only fed to 20 treated dogs for 60 days. The faecal samples of all dogs at day 0 and day 60 were analyzed using a metagenomic approach. The results showed a significantly higher microbial diversity and an obvious change in the structure of the gut microbiota in the treatment group. There was also an increase in the abundance of some beneficial bacteria in differently aged dogs, such as @gm$ Lactobacillus johnsonii @/gm$ (P < 0.05), Lactobacillus reuteri (P < 0.01), Lactobacillus acidophilus (P < 0.05) and Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (P < 0.05), and a reduction in the abundance of many opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.05) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (P < 0.05) with the supplementation of probiotics. Intriguingly, the correlated networks among some pathogenic bacteria decreased following the administration of probiotics. Additionally, metagenomic analysis revealed the upregulation of pathways involved in the metabolism of amino acids and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, accompanied by the downregulation of pathways associated with virulence of pathogenic bacteria and cell signaling, suggesting that probiotics could improve the health of dogs with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ through regulation of the gut microbiota. Our research provides new information relevant to the treatment of @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in animals and humans.	2
The alteration of periodontal microbiome composition has been previously reported in atherosclerotic vascular disease (@di$ ASVD @/di$). Much of the recent studies focused on discovering the difference in microbiome composition in oral, coronary, and carotid plaques from patients with and without periodontal infection. A comparative analysis performed by Kannosh et al. showed that Tannerella forsythensis (T.f) and @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ (T.d) were the most and the least common bacteria causing atherosclerotic plaques (APs), respectively. The dominated periopathogenic bacteria of APs were dominated by T. forsythensis (53%), P. gingivalis (38%), P. intermedia (1%), A. actinomycetemcomitans (14%), and @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ (6%).	1
The analysis utilized data from participants in the placebo arm of the Preventing @di$ Vaginal Infections @/di$ trial, which enrolled HIV-uninfected women from the United States and Kenya. Detection of bacterial taxa associated with BV was compared between visits with versus without reported vaginal washing. The effect of vaginal washing on a number of vaginal bacteria differed substantially (p<0.05) between the US and Kenya, so results were stratified by country. In US women, vaginal washing was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of detection of BV associated bacterium 1 (BVAB1) (relative risk [RR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.09, p = 0.004), BVAB2 (RR 1.99, 95%CI 1.46-2.71, p<0.001), @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$ (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.46-2.96, p<0.001), Atopobium vaginae (RR 1.34, 95%CI 1.13-1.59, p = 0.001), Leptotrichia/Sneathia species (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.33-2.09, p<0.001), Megasphaera species (RR 1.78, 95%CI 1.34-2.37, p<0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.16, p = 0.02).	1
The animal was presented with muco-purulent nasal discharge, dyspnoea, coughing, icteric sclera and oral mucosa, bloated abdomen, @di$ diarrhoea @/di$, hematochezia and coffee coloured urine. History of tick infestation was reported by the owner. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnea, pre-scapular and pre-femoral lymphadenopathy and respiratory wheezes. Laboratory investigations revealed anaemia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopaenia, hypoproteinemia, hyperbilirubinemia and haemoglobinuria. On microscopic examination, small pyriform Babesia sp. (probably @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$) could be detected in Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear.	1
The antidiabetic effect was transmissible upon fecal transplantation, showing that the intestinal microbiota restores SGLT1 expression and glucose sensing in untreated @di$ obese @/di$ rats. Before treatment, mice consuming the high-fat diet had a decreased abundance of gram-positive phylum Actinobacteria, while phylum Proteobacteria and genus Escherichia were increased relative to the control group consuming regular chow. The molecular link to SGLT1 expression is unknown, but it is likely that microbial metabolites such as SCFAs activate glucose sensing. Metagenomic analysis of a Dutch cohort corroborated that SCFA concentrations are higher in metformin users compared to diabetics not taking metformin. Analysis of a Colombian community found that metformin users had higher levels of SCFA-producing A. muciniphila, @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$, and Prevotella.	2
The authors reported that Bifidobacterium breve M-16V administration was not only effective in improving the severity of @di$ allergic symptoms @/di$ but also significantly increased the number of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species and decreased the number of total aerobes in the gut microbiota.	2
"The authors retrospectively searched these microorganisms by PCR in surgically-collected sinusal pus specimens from patients diagnosed with refractory @di$ sinusitis @/di$, defined by the persistance of sinus inflammation and related-symptoms for more than 12 weeks despite appropriate treatment. Of the 116 tested sinus surgical specimens, 12 (10.3%) from 9 patients (six females, three males; aged 20-71 years) were PCR-positive. These specimens were further investigated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization, PCR amplicon-sequencing and culture. Methanobrevibacter smithii was documented in four patients and @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$ in another four, one of whom was also culture-positive. They were associated with a mixed flora including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In the latter patient, ""Methanobrevibacter massiliense"" was the sole microorganism detected. These results highlight methanogenic archaea as being part of a mixed anaerobic flora involved in refractory @di$ sinusitis @/di$, and suggest that the treatment of this condition should include an antibiotic active against methanogens, notably a nitroimidazole derivative."	1
The bacterium @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$ is the causative agent of listeriosis, a highly fatal opportunistic foodborne infection. Listeria spp. are isolated from a diversity of environmental sources, including soil, water, effluents, a large variety of foods, and the feces of humans and animals. Recent outbreaks demonstrated that @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ can cause gastroenteritis in otherwise healthy individuals and more severe invasive disease in immunocompromised patients. Common symptoms include fever, watery diarrhea, @di$ nausea @/di$, headache, and pains in joints and muscles. The intestinal tract is the major portal of entry for @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, whereby strains penetrate the mucosal tissue either directly, via invasion of enterocytes, or indirectly, via active penetration of the Peyer's patches. Studies have revealed the strategy taken by the bacteria to overcome changes in oxygen tension, osmolarity, acidity, and the sterilizing effects of bile or antimicrobial peptides to adapt to conditions in the gut. In addition, @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ has evolved species-specific strategies for intestinal entry by exploiting the interaction between the internalin protein and its receptor E-cadherin, or inducing diarrhea and an inflammatory response via the activity of its hemolytic toxin, listeriolysin. The ability of these bacteria to survive in bile-rich environments, and to induce depletion of sentinel cells such as Paneth cells that monitor the luminal burden of commensal bacteria, suggest strategies that have evolved to promote intestinal survival. Preexisting gastrointestinal disease may be a risk factor for infection of the gastrointestinal tract with @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$. Currently, there is enough evidence to warrant consideration of @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ as a possible etiology in outbreaks of febrile gastroenteritis, and for further studies to examine the genetic structure of Listeria strains that have a propensity to cause gastrointestinal versus systemic infections.	1
The breadth of functional categories and gene families that were altered in response to the localized infection in calvarial soft tissue included transcription, cell proliferation, cell cycle, transport, cell adhesion, stress, apoptosis, defense response, ECM, and cell differentiation, indicating that @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ elicits a multitude of specific gene expression changes during infection. In bone, functional categories and gene families that were altered in response to the localized infection included cell proliferation, cell cycle, transcription, transport, defense and immune response, apoptosis, and ECM. Similar functional categories were also altered following infection with other @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogens, P.	1
The campylobacteriosis (with clinical symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and @di$ fever @/di$) is mostly self-limiting but sequelae like Guillian-Barre syndrome and reactive arthritis have been described. Handling and consumption of raw or undercooked meat has been identified as a main source for human infections. Campylobacter belongs to the heterogeneous class of Epsilonproteobacteria and the species mostly detected in diseased humans are Campylobacter jejuni followed by @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ and to a lesser extent Campylobacter lari and Campylobacter upsaliensis. Whereas C. jejuni shows high prevalences in poultry and cattle, @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ is usually associated with pigs and C. lari is frequently detected in shellfish and shorebirds. However, in these animals, Campylobacter belongs to the commensal microbiota. By comprehensive genome comparisons of several strains, it has been shown that C. jejuni is more closely related to @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ compared to C.	1
The case history and autopsy of a young boy chronically infected with @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ is reported. The pathology of the lesions, which affected mainly the skin and the bones, was that of a nonspecific inflammatory reaction, with many acid-fast bacteria. Some improvement was obtained by these use of several antimycobacterial drugs, but the general condition deteriorated, the child dying at the age of 16 after more than five years of sickness. One of the causes of death was a severe generalized @di$ amyloidosis @/di$. This case is discussed in relation with the very small number of autopsies of patients dying of infection caused by scotochromogenic mycobacteria, or @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$.	1
The causal effects of the remaining 207 gut microbiotas on @di$ CHB @/di$ are shown in Supplementary Table S3. Figure 2 illustrates 11 gut microbiotas that exert significant causal effects on @di$ CHB @/di$. Briefly, the estimate of IVW suggested that genetically predicted class Alphaproteobacteria (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.96; p = 0.033; FDR = 0.046), genus Family XIII AD3011 group (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.91; p = 0.017; FDR = 0.026), genus Prevotella 7 (OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94; p = 0.015; FDR = 0.022), unknown genus id.2001 (OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.97; p = 0.010; FDR = 0.029), unknown genus id.2755 (OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.93; p = 0.013; FDR = 0.023), and unknown genus id.959 (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99; p = 0.047; FDR = 0.065) all exhibited a protective causal relationship with @di$ CHB @/di$. Conversely, genetically predicted family Family XIII (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.12; p = 0.039; FDR = 0.061), genus Eggerthella (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74; p = 0.023; FDR = 0.043), genus @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$ group (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51; p = 0.046; FDR = 0.056), genus Holdemania (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.82; p = 0.040; FDR = 0.049), and genus Ruminococcus gauvreauii group (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10-2.61; p = 0.017; FDR = 0.076) exhibited a risk effect on @di$ CHB @/di$.	1
The causative organisms of @di$ internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis @/di$ are usually members of the normal oropharyngeal flora. The most commonly and historically described pathogen is the anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum. Other pathogens include other Fusobacterium species and also other organisms such as Eikenella corrodens, @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$, Bacteroides spp., as well as streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus anginosus-group (also known as the S.	1
The clinical manifestations and outcomes of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$-associated soft tissue infections vary in relation to the immune status of the host. Since @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species were considered rare pathogens of necrotizing fasciitis in immunocompromised patients , we present an uncommon case of A. sobria necrotizing fasciitis in Italy. In immunocompromised hosts, @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$-associated soft tissue infections can be fulminant and fatal. Previous studies have shown that @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species infections are strongly associated with mortality . Table  1 shows cases of @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species necrotizing fasciitis that have been reported in the literature. Similar features are revealed in the literature and previously described case reports have comparable clinical characteristics. Chang et al. illustrated a fulminant necrotizing fasciitis caused by A. sobria in patients with neutropenia whose fatal clinical course was just like that described by Martino et al. in their report of two cases with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia who developed septic shock caused by @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species with soft tissue complications. Both studies confirm the potentially aggressive nature of these bacteria in patients with neutropenic cancer. Tsai et al.  also reported the rapid onset of skin necrosis and sepsis caused by A. sobria in two patients with @di$ diabetes @/di$ who died only a few days after admission. Finally, Stano et al. described a fatal A. sobria sepsis complicated by rhabdomyolysis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus. What is described in the literature seems to suggest that A. sobria is the more pathogenic among @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ bacteria since only patients with infections caused by A.	1
The clinical significance of long-term methicillin-resistant @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (MRSA) @di$ bacteremia @/di$ remains unclear. We evaluated the clinical, microbiological characteristics, and clinical outcomes of long-term MRSA bacteremia. A nested case-control study was conducted in a prospective cohort of adult patients with MRSA bacteremia at a tertiary hospital between August 2008 and December 2017. Patients with long-term MRSA bacteremia (>= 14 days) were compared with control patients, defined as having @di$ bacteremia @/di$ that resolved in less than 3 days. The following variables were documented: heteroresistance phenotype, genotypes, agr dysfunction, and the presence of 41 virulence genes in isolates. Of the total 890 patients studied, 69 patients (7.8%) exhibited long-term MRSA bacteremia and 599 (67.3%) exhibited resolving @di$ bacteremia @/di$. The most common sources of long-term @di$ bacteremia @/di$ were central venous catheter-related infection (39%) and osteomyelitis (19%). Independent risk factors for long-term MRSA bacteremia included male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.43), community-acquired @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (aOR = 2.93), the presence of a prosthetic device (aOR = 3.40), and osteomyelitis (aOR = 7.98). Metastatic infections developed more frequently in patients with long-term @di$ bacteremia @/di$ than in those with resolving @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (56.5% vs. 8.0%; P < 0.001). Although there were no significant differences in 30-day, 12-week, or in-hospital mortality rates between the two groups, infection-attributable mortality was higher in the long-term @di$ bacteremia @/di$ group (23.2% vs. 11.5%; P = 0.01). Microbiological characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups. Clinical factors, including community-acquired @di$ bacteremia @/di$, the presence of a prosthetic device, and osteomyelitis, appear to contribute to long-term MRSA bacteremia more than microbiological factors.	1
The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine could restore the indices of FT3 and TSH in patients with @di$ GD @/di$ to the normal range, shift TRAb closer to the healthy level, and significantly improve the therapeutic effect on patients with @di$ GD @/di$. In addition, compared with the use of Western medicine alone, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine significantly changed the intestinal microbiota of @di$ GD @/di$ patients, increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria in @di$ GD @/di$ patients, and decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. To gain more insight into how the potential prebiotic berberine interacts with the gut microbiota to achieve improved efficacy, we then correlated the strains, the metabolic pathways that produced significant differences compared to baseline after 6 months of treatment and four thyroid indicators in the combined Chinese and Western medicine group (r > 0.4) ( Figure 5A ). After the addition of potential prebiotics berberine, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ were negatively correlated with FT3, FT4 and TRAb but positively correlated with TSH; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was positively correlated with enterobacterin biosynthesis; and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Lactococcus lactis @/gm$ were positively correlated with the three metabolic pathways of vitamin K2 synthesis.	2
The comparison of the AEDA results obtained in this study with the results from the comparative aroma profile analyses of non-fermented LPI and LPI fermented with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ and L. sakei ssp. carnosus as previously reported by Schlegel, Leidigkeit, Eisner and Schweiggert-Weisz are in very good agreement. In our previous study, non-fermented LPI was primarily characterized using descriptive analyzes by the retronasal aroma attributes pea-like/green bell pepper-like and oatmeal-like/@di$ fatty @/di$, followed by earthy/moldy/beetroot-like, cooked potato-like and roasty/popcorn-like aroma impressions. LPI fermented with @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ exhibited an intense cheesy aroma impression followed by a moderate intensity of oatmeal-like/@di$ fatty @/di$ impressions. LPI fermented with L. sakei ssp. carnosus was described with popcorn-like/roasty as main aroma characteristic, followed by oatmeal-like/@di$ fatty @/di$ with a moderate intensity.	0
The concentrations of fecal acetate and propionate in the @di$ HTL @/di$ group were significantly lower, while urine acetate was significantly higher than HTE. Furthermore, @di$ HTL @/di$ exhibited higher serum acetate, but their immune cells expressed no significant changes in SCFAs receptors. A common explanation is that the lower fecal SCFAs in the long-lived elderly may be due to the reduction of SCFA-producing bacteria and the decreased metabolic activity of the gut microbiota. However, the relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ was higher in @di$ HTL @/di$ than in HTE, and there was no significant difference in dietary fiber intake between the two groups, so it would not be lower from the perspective of SCFAs production. Everything gets interesting when explained in terms of SCFA uptake levels. SCFAs are efficiently absorbed in the colon, and less than 5% are excreted in the feces. Fecal SCFAs reflect SCFAs that cannot be absorbed in the host colon and are surrogate indicators of colonic SCFAs absorption. Fecal SCFAs concentrations are more representative of SCFAs uptake than their production. Fecal SCFAs are significantly increased, and serum SCFAs are significantly decreased in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ patients, indicating that the adequate absorption level of SCFAs in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ patients is lower. Higher levels of fecal SCFAs are associated with gut dysbiosis, obesity, and @di$ hypertension @/di$, presumably due to the lower absorption rate of SCFAs in the gut.	1
The control group (n=40) matched for age and sex consisted of 30 individuals with no history of @di$ fever @/di$ or any Gram negative bacterial infection in the recent past. It also included two patients whose blood culture had grown Escherichia coli, two patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae septicaemia, and three patients each whose blood culture had grown @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ and Group B Salmonella.	0
The course of the disease, drug for @di$ rheumatism @/di$, and restricted motor skills, on the other hand, did not affect periodontal conditions, even though there was a statistically significant association between a rheumatoid factor and periodontal condition. Their studies also reported that within the RA group, higher serum levels of @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ may be a significant marker for the higher burden of the bacteria and invasive periodontal diseases, which may justify why this bacterium is the only periodontal pathogen correlated with a higher risk of RA.	1
The culture grew @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ in both of them. There was no residual deformity reported in these cases. In isolated EOM pyomyositis, paranasal sinuses may be normal. Differential diagnosis should include myocysticercosis, nonspecific myositis, orbital cellulitis, dermoid cyst with infection, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and @di$ carotid cavernous fistula @/di$.	0
The culture was identified as @gm$ Burkholderia gladioli @/gm$ and produced at least five different antimicrobial compounds which were highly stable at high temperature (121 C) and in the broad pH range (3.0-11.0). We report here the antimicrobial activity of @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ against drug resistant @di$ bacterial pathogens @/di$.	2
The current study unravels the venom composition of @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ with tandem mass spectrometry and 454 sequencing data. From the venom gland transcriptome, 104 precursors were recovered from 11 superfamilies, with superfamily A (especially kappaA-) conotoxins dominating (77%) their venom. Proteomic analysis confirmed that kappaA-conotoxins dominated the predation-evoked milked venom of each of six @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ analyzed and revealed remarkable intraspecific variation in both the intensity and type of conotoxins. High-throughput FLIPR assays revealed that the predation-evoked venom contained a range of conotoxins targeting the nAChR, Cav, and Nav ion channels, consistent with alpha- and omega-conotoxins being used for predation by @gm$ C. catus @/gm$. However, the kappaA-conotoxins did not act at these targets but induced potent and rapid immobilization followed by bursts of activity and finally @di$ paralysis @/di$ when injected intramuscularly in zebrafish. Our venomics approach revealed the complexity of the envenomation strategy used by @gm$ C. catus @/gm$, which contains a mix of both excitatory and inhibitory venom peptides.	1
The development of apical @di$ pulmonary fibrosis @/di$ and bullous disease is a rare but well recognized extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The fibrobullous disease is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed at an incidental radiological examination. When symptoms do develop, they are usually due to superimposed colonization or infection by bacteria, fungi or mycobacteria. Only six cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterial superinfection in AS have been reported. We report a patient with AS and progressive apical fibrobullous disease in whom @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$ was repeatedly cultured over a 12-year period.	1
The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute @di$ bronchitis @/di$ (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1).	0

The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$ (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1).	1
The difference in functional composition of gut microbiota between @di$ PD @/di$ patients and healthy individuals was further explored, which was visualized by the STAMP software. As shown in Fig. 3A-C, gut microbiota was mainly enriched in the superpathway of arginine and polyamine biosynthesis and NAD biosynthesis I (NAD+ anabolic pathway) functional pathways. Previous studies have revealed that the polyamine pathway and NAD and its associated metabolites are essential for the occurrence and progression of @di$ PD @/di$. Furthermore, the difference in bacteria associated with NAD+ anabolic pathways was also found. @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ had a higher abundance in @di$ PD @/di$ patients, and Coprococcus had a higher abundance in healthy individuals (Fig. 3D). Cumulatively, gut microbiota may participate in the occurrence and development of @di$ PD @/di$ through superpathway of arginine and polyamine biosynthesis and NAD+ anabolic pathways.	1
The disease caused by @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ is gastroenteritis, and the infectious dose is estimated to be greater than 106 CFU. Ingestion does not always cause this disease, which is generally self-limited and accompanied by fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting; in severe cases, the diarrheal stools can be yellowish green, foamy, and bloody. @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ is also capable of causing septicemia with a high mortality rate and other extraintestinal infections, such as @di$ cellulitis @/di$, urinary tract infections, peritonitis, meningitis, conjunctivitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, arthritis, endophthalmitis, and cholecystitis.	1
The diversity of the gut microbiome can have a substantial impact on the development of the immune system and disease risk, particularly for @di$ autoimmune diseases @/di$ such as psoriasis. A study using microbiota and inflammation-related characteristics suggested that microbiota dysbiosis may result in an abnormal immune response in psoriasis. By generating butyrates with antioxidant properties, @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ contribute significantly to gut homeostasis. NF-kappaB, which controls the inflammatory response, is inhibited in intestinal epithelial cells by 15 kDa protein as an anti-inflammatory protein produced by @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$, and they also provide intestinal membrane-lining cells (enterocytes).	2
The effect of NA on the survival of zebrafishes challenged with @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ was assessed. The uninfected control group showed 100% survival at 96 h. At 24 h of immersion challenge test, zebrafishes started to show clinical signs such as lethargy, increased respiration, abnormal swimming, abdominal ulceration, abdominal dropsy, and @di$ bulged eye @/di$.	1
The effect of TDH on these cells is very crucial for biological functions, such as @di$ diarrhea @/di$, during infection. TDH binds to phospholipid bilayers, in which single channel events occur. The mechanisms of cell binding and calcium ions influx result in the increase of intracellular Ca+ and release of chloride ions in human colonic epithelial cells. When the osmotic pressure of the cell exceeds its limit of self-regulation, pathological changes follow, leading to cell expansion and even death. Homologs of V. parahaemolyticus TDH are expressed in other vibrios causing @di$ diarrhea @/di$, such as non-O1 Vibrio cholerae and @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$.	1
The effect of a serine protease (ASP) secreted from @gm$ Aeromonas sobria @/gm$ on plasma coagulation was investigated. Proteolytically active ASP promoted human plasma coagulation in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with the preference for a factor Xa-specific oligo-peptide substrate, ASP produced enzymatic activity from human prothrombin but not from factors IX and X. ASP cleaved prothrombin to produce enzymatically active 37 kDa-fragment displaying the same molecular mass as alpha-thrombin. ASP is the first bacterial serine protease that produces alpha-thrombin, through which ASP may contribute to the induction of @di$ thrombotic tendency @/di$ in disseminated intravascular coagulation complicated with sepsis caused by A.	1
"The effect of community richness on the diversity of @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ were analyzed by an analysis of variance with sequential sum of squares (type I) using linear models. To assess whether diversity effects were only due to the presence of single species, we fitted each species (presence/absence) before species richness in separate sequential analyses. If fitting single genotypes before species richness removed the effect of richness indices, the observed diversity effects may have been mainly caused by a sampling effect (the inclusion of a particular genotype in the community). To further explain whether species composition matters, we used ANOVA to test the effect of the presence of each species and their interactions on @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ diversity. The simplest model was obtained by AICc ranking using the R package ""MuMIn"". The effects of the presence of single species and initial community diversity on the proportion of @di$ WS @/di$, and on the density of @di$ WS @/di$ were tested with sequential linear models as described above."	0
The effect of the Faecalibacterium supernatant on DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice has been reported previously. However, the ability of the supernatant to relieve inflammation in animals is controversial. In the current study, the amount of butyrate in the cecum was significantly higher in the FB group than in other groups. This could be related to the amount of butyrate in the FB supernatant. The mechanism underpinning the effect of the FB supernatant could be explained by the reported beneficial effect of sodium butyrate on the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. Butyrate consumption decreases the pH in the colon, which stimulates the abundance of some bacteria, e.g., @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$.	2
The effects against bacterial strains @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ (MIC = 200 mug/mL) and S. aureus (MIC = 800 mug/mL) can be beneficial because these bacteria are related to food poisoning. In addition, the effects against SGS1 RAD14, and MLH1 yeast strains (MIC = 800 mug/mL), offer an opportunity for future research using actual carcinogenic cells because these yeast strains harbor mutations relevant to the @di$ Bloom and Werner syndrome @/di$ (SGS1), XPA human homolog (RAD14), and colon, ovary, or renal cancer (MLH1).	0
The eight normal and eight @di$ obese @/di$ cat microbiomes formed two distinct groups when unsupervised clustering was performed using the relative abundance of the top 20 genera (Fig. 3A), indicating microbial composition differences occurred at the most abundant genera level. Prevotella was the most abundant genus (24.3%; Fig. 3A and B and Table S4 and S5), and the relative proportions of the top 20 genera were highly correlated with the previous 16S rDNA sequencing studies (Fig. S4B; Spearman's rho = 0.703, P = 0.003, Spearman's Rank Correlation test). Of the top 5 genera, Bacteroides increased in the @di$ obese @/di$ cat gut microbiota with a marginal statistical significance (Fig. 3C; P-adj = 0.059, Mann-Whitney U test), which may explain the overrepresentation of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level (Fig. 2E). Two Firmicutes genera were significantly altered in the @di$ obese @/di$ cat gut microbiome: Lactimicrobium and @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium @/gm$ accounted for 0.87% and 0.75% respectively in normal cats, but were not found (<0.0005%) in @di$ obese @/di$ cats (P-adj = 0.006; Fig. 3C and Table S6). This result was consistent with the decreased abundance of Firmicutes in the @di$ obese @/di$ microbiome at the phylum level (Fig. 2E). The Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio, which was reported to predict body weight and fat loss potential in humans, showed no significant change in @di$ obese @/di$ and normal cat gut microbiota (Fig.	2
The emergence and persistence of aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were investigated in 26 children treated with penicillin for @di$ otitis media @/di$ or pharyngitis and in 28 nontreated control children. beta-Lactamase-producers were isolated in three (12%) of the treated children before therapy, in 12 (46%) seven to ten days after completion of therapy, in nine (35%) 40 to 45 days after therapy, and in seven (27%) 85 to 90 days after therapy. These organisms were present in three (11%) of the nontreated children, and the number of patients harboring BLPB stayed constant throughout the three-month follow-up. The predominant BLPB were @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species (@gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$ group, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides oris-buccae), Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis.	1
The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute @di$ pharyngitis @/di$ (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis.	1
The errors were marginally high for Enterobacteriaceae testing against beta lactam- beta lactamase inhibitor combinations, for Pseudomonas species against aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin and @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ species against cefoxitin, one should be vigilant while reporting @di$ dDD @/di$ result of these antibiotic organism combinations.	0
The etiology for his @di$ endocarditis @/di$ was unclear. A colonoscopy was suggested, but his clinical instability made such a procedure intolerable. Final cultures revealed Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. @gm$ pasteurianus @/gm$ (previously bovis biotype II).	1
The evidence that women supplemented with probiotics had fewer symptoms of postnatal @di$ anxiety @/di$ and depression caused by stress is consistent with two previous clinical studies evaluating the effect of probiotics on stress-related parameters in different target populations. The first study is a proof-of-concept trial of 30 students enrolled during an exam session and treated with a probiotic supplement containing the same strains L. reuteri PBS072 and @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ BB077.	2
The fight against stunting and @di$ wasting @/di$ is the prioritized agenda of several regional, national and international interventions in low and middle-income countries. Understanding the causes of EED and specifically characterizing the associated pathogens provide opportunities to design effective interventions to improve the health and well-being of children. Therefore, the current study is aimed at estimating the prevalence, abundance, diversity, and co-occurrence of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ spp. in children stools collected in the Haramaya District/Woreda, East Hararghe zone, Oromia region, in rural eastern Ethiopia, and to assess their association with EED, diarrhea, and host microbiome. This study is a part of the cross-sectional formative research of the @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ Genomics and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (CAGED) project, which included an epidemiological investigation of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ exposure, EED, stunting, and their associated risk factors. Results provided by this cross-sectional study will provide a strong baseline for examining the role of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ in EED.	1
The first clinical presentation of the genetic immunodeficiency dates back to when the child was aged 2 y and 10 mo, when he presented a multi-focal @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ caused by @gm$ Mycobacterium scrofulaceum @/gm$.	1
The first principal component (PC1) (46.0%) correlated positively with a number of important short-chain fatty acid-producing species (P <= 0.01 for all species; Spearman rho test), such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis (11%), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (5.6%), Clostridium clostridioforme (2.3%), and @gm$ Roseburia faecis @/gm$ (0.94%), as shown in Fig. 1. This PC1 was inversely related to the number of @di$ diabetes @/di$-associated autoantibodies in children (Fig.	2
"The following clinical parameters were assessed: decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMF-T)/decayed, missing, and filled surface teeth index, hygiene index, papilla bleeding index, Periodontal Screening Index, and @gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$/Lactobacillus concentration in saliva. The teenagers of the ""prevention"" group of phase IV of our prospective study revealed a share of 89.7% @di$ caries @/di$-free dentitions (65.5% sound; 24.2% @di$ caries @/di$-free with fillings). Mean DMF-T was 0.55 +/- 1.0. The control group showed a significantly higher mean DMF-T of 1.5 +/- 1.5 (p < 0.05) and revealed 56.7% of @di$ caries @/di$-free dentitions (30% sound, 26.7% @di$ caries @/di$-free with restorations)."	1
The following strains were used: @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ IATA-ES2 (CECT 7365), Shigella CBD8, and Escherichia coli CBL2. @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ IATA-ES2 was isolated from the feces of healthy babies and identified as described previously. E. coli CBL2 and Shigella CBD8 were isolated from @di$ celiac @/di$ patients and identified as described by Sanchez et al.	0
The genera @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$, Enterorhabdus, and Gordonibacter belong to the Actinobacteria phylum, which consists of Gram-positive bacteria characterized by high guanine and cytosine contents and has previously been shown less prevalent in healthy smoking individuals. @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ spp. have been isolated from patients with CD and a member of this genus previously appeared less prevalent in relatives of patients with CD compared with unrelated controls. Enterorhabdus spp. have been identified from mouse models of @di$ ileitis @/di$ and colitis and from the human gut.	1

The genera Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus, Providencia, and @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$, as well as the species from Citrobacter freundii complex, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Shewanella algae and Vagococcus fluvialis, found in this study, were already reported in bivalve mollusks (especially clams, mussels and oysters). These groups of bacteria, some of which are fish pathogens, are commonly found in aquatic environments. All these bacteria were already associated with human infections, such as ear and eye infections, osteomyelitis, infective arthritis, endocarditis, @di$ bacteremia @/di$, meningitis, intestinal and urinary tract infections, brain abscess, peritonitis, enteritis and septicemia, and some are recognized as important agents in nosocomial infections.	1
The genera Ileibacterium and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were markedly enriched in the high-dose EB group. Bifidobacterium spp. are closely linked to lipid metabolism of the body, according to earlier studies. Enzymes from Bifidobacterium spp. can dissociate and decompose bile acid salts, thus degrading the bile acid that returns to the intestine through the hepatic and intestinal circulation. Bifidobacterium spp. can also produce hydroxymethylglutaric acid (HMG), which affects the activity of HMG coenzyme A reductase in cholesterol. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Bifidobacterium longum APC1472 and @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ APC6331 lessen the internalization signaling of the gastric starvation hormone-regulated receptor. Patients with @di$ PCOS @/di$ who received supplements containing Bifidobacterium V9 had significantly lower levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and significantly higher levels of sex hormone and intestinal SCFAs.	2
The genomic epidemiology of pathogens has driven the latter - recently in viral outbreaks such as COVID-19 and Ebola, and in many bacterial conditions such as cholera or @di$ pneumonia @/di$. Since metagenomes can simultaneously access all community members with relatively little bias, such studies are now possible with organisms previously overlooked due to the absence of obviously associated phenotypes or convenient culture techniques. @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ is one such example; despite being over 50% prevalent among typical human gut communities, only 15 isolates were previously sequenced, precluding epidemiology or phylogenetics. In addition to making a novel sub-species phylogenetic and biogeographic structure apparent, the combination of MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN, PanPhlAn, StrainPhlAn, and PhyloPhlAn together confirmed that most @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ strains are 'personal' (i.e.	1
The genus @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ is highly diverse, comprising oxidase-positive and -negative, nonpigmented, Gram-negative coccobacilli. @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ is a major pathogen for nosocomial infections such as nosocomial @di$ pneumonia @/di$ and catheter-related bloodstream infections. In rare cases, this pathogen has been known to cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In Japan, a few cases of CAP caused by @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ have been reported in recent years. Most such cases are fulminant in nature, involve sepsis or multiple-organ failure, and consequently show a high mortality rate. Here, we report a case of mild @gm$ A. baumannii @/gm$ pneumonia that occurred in an otherwise healthy woman.	1
The genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ has been shown to have beneficial health effects due to the effect on the gut barrier and immune system. The association of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ abundance and @di$ obesity @/di$ has been studied in several studies[-]. Ignacio et al. have reported the negative correlation between the abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and BMI and showed increased abundance of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ spp. in the lean group. Similarly, we identified significant negative correlation of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ abundance with BMI increase.	2
The genus @gm$ Burkholderia @/gm$ was formerly classified as the genus Pseudomonas. The virulence of @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ in humans is recognized to be low, and the clinical manifestations of this pathogen in non-lung transplantation patients have not been fully elucidated. We treated a 62-year-old female patient with @di$ myasthenia gravis @/di$, a thymoma and immune-mediated granulocytopenia. She had been treated with tacrolimus for the previous 12 months. From her sputum, non-fermenting Gram-negative rods were cultured microbiologically. The isolate was oxidase-negative, indole-negative and nitrate-negative. The 16S rRNA detection in our collaborator's laboratory confirmed @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ as a 99% comparable DNA sequence. The patient's case was complicated with bronchiolitis followed by bacteraemia due to @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$. The infection of @gm$ B. gladioli @/gm$ presented as diffuse panbronchiolitis (Fig.1) and progressed into repeated bacteraemia.	1
The genus Roseburia was positively correlated with scores on the picture vocabulary test for the @di$ Stroke @/di$ group. Bacteroides uniformis and Alistipes putredinis were positively correlated with self-efficacy score and Escherichia coli was negatively correlated with self-efficacy.

The genus Shigella encompasses four subgroups historically treated as species: Shigella flexneri, @gm$ Shigella boydii @/gm$, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella dysenteriae. These species are the etiological agents of bacillary dysentery or shigellosis, manifested by fever, small volume of bloody, mucoid stools; abdominal cramps; and mucoid, bloody diarrhea. Other clinical manifestations range between nausea, @di$ vomiting @/di$, and dehydration.	1
The gut microbiome has been considered one of the most critical biomarkers in predicting the prognosis of anti-PD-1 therapy and has been widely studied in many tumors, but not yet in @di$ NPC @/di$. In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota in 50 RM-@di$ NPC @/di$ patients that received anti-PD-1 treatment, and excluded 9 in the following analysis due to confounding effects from antibiotics. We found that responders and non-responders had no differences in gut microbiota diversity. Intriguingly, we identified several bacteria to be enriched in the non-responders, including @gm$ Blautia obeum @/gm$, and a bacterium belonging to the Erysipelatoclostridium genus, one to the Oscillospiraceae family, and one to the Clostridiales order, all with high abundance. The abundance of Oscillospira was previously reported to be significantly increased in @di$ NPC @/di$ patients.	1
The gut microbiome was analyzed to identify potential @di$ depression @/di$-related gut microbes, and the fecal metabolome was analyzed to detect their functional metabolites. The correlations between altered gut microbes and metabolites in the long-term depression rats were explored. The crucial metabolic pathways related to long-term depression were uncovered through enrichment analysis based on these gut microbes and metabolites. Results: The microbial composition of long-term depression (8-week CUMS) showed decreased species richness indices and different profiles compared with the control group and the 4-week CUMS group, characterized by disturbance of @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$, Bacteroides ovatus, and Alistipes senegalensis at the species level. Additionally, long-term depression was associated with disturbances in fecal metabolomics. D-pinitol was the only increased metabolite in the 8-week CUMS group among the top 10 differential metabolites, while the top 3 decreased metabolites in the long-term depression rats included indoxyl sulfate, trimethylaminen-oxide, and 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxocholanoic acid. The disordered fecal metabolomics in the long-term depression rats mainly involved the biosynthesis of pantothenate, CoA, valine, leucine and isoleucine. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the gut microbiome may participate in the long-term development of @di$ depression @/di$, and the mechanism may be related to the regulation of gut metabolism.	1

The gut microbiota is associated with cardiovascular diseases, including @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$. However, the composition, functional capacity, and metabolites of the gut microbiome about @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we reanalyzed 25 metagenomic stool samples from Sweden and 385 metagenomic stool samples from China using HUMAnN2, PanPhlAn, and MelonnPan to obtain more sufficient information. We found that the samples from @di$ atherosclerotic @/di$ patients in both cohorts were depleted in @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Eubacterium eligens, Roseburia inulinivorans, and Roseburia intestinalis. At the functional level, healthy metagenomes were both enriched in pathways of starch degradation V, glycolysis III (from glucose), CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and folate transformations. R inulinivorans and R intestinalis are major contributors to starch degradation V, while E eligens greatly contribute to the pathway CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and @gm$ B xylanisolvens @/gm$ and B uniformis contribute to folate transformations II. The 11 marker species selected from the Chinese cohort distinguish patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.86. Strain-level microbial analysis revealed a geographically associated adaptation of the strains from E eligens, B uniformis, and E coli. Two gut microbial metabolites, nicotinic acid and hydrocinnamic acid, had significantly higher predicted abundance in the control samples compared to the patients in the Chinese cohort, and interestinglynicotinic acid is already an effective lipid-lowering drug to reducing cardiovascular risk. Our results indicate intestinal bacteria such as @gm$ B xylanisolvens @/gm$, E eligens, and R inulinivorans could be promising probiotics and potential therapeutic target for @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$.	2
The gut-lung axis is a potential mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences @di$ lung inflammation @/di$. Gut microbiota can influence local immunity, systemic inflammation, and host immune suppression. Gut microbiota activate immune cells, which can migrate from the gut to the lung and assist in resisting systemic inflammatory disease, and release metabolites and endotoxins to influence host immune response. Additionally, gut microbiota dysbiosis damages the integrity of the intestinal barrier and enables bacterial translocation. Bacteria in the gut can translocate to the lung through the lymphatic or blood circulation systems and thus mediate @di$ lung inflammation @/di$. Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia-@gm$ Shigella @/gm$, and several gut-associated bacteria have been detected in pancreatic fluid which suggested bacteria translocation could occur in AP patients and lead to infected pancreatic necrosis.	1
The highest proportion of pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=37, 66.1%), followed by Escherichia coli (n=16, 28.6%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=1, 1.8%), @gm$ Citrobacter freundii @/gm$ (n=1, 1.8%), and Raoultella planticola (n=1, 1.8%). Among them, 12 patients (21.4%) had multi-site infections. The sites of CRE infection included bloodstream (n=29, 51.8%), pulmonary (n=27, 48.2%), intraperitoneal infection (n=5, 8.9%), and others (n=7, 12.5%; urinary @di$ tract @/di$ n=2; intracranial n=2; skin n=3).	0
The human gut microbiota is currently seen as an important factor that can promote @di$ autism spectrum disorder @/di$ (@di$ ASD @/di$) development in children.Aim. This study aimed to detect differences in the taxonomic composition and content of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the metabolism of neuroactive biomarker compounds in the metagenomes of gut microbiota of children with @di$ ASD @/di$ and neurotypical children.Methodology. A whole metagenome sequencing approach was used to obtain metagenomic data on faecal specimens of 36 children with @di$ ASD @/di$ and 21 healthy neurotypical children of 3-5 years old. Taxonomic analysis was conducted using MetaPhlAn2. The developed bioinformatics algorithm and created catalogue of the orthologues were applied to identify bacterial genes of neuroactive compounds in the metagenomes. For the identification of metagenomic signatures of children with @di$ ASD @/di$, Wilcoxon's test and adjustment for multiple comparisons were used.Results. Statistically significant differences with decreases in average abundance in the microbiota of @di$ ASD @/di$ children were found for the genera Barnesiella and Parabacteroides and species @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$, B. caccae, Bacteroides intestinihominis, Eubacterium rectale, Parabacteroides distasonis and Ruminococcus lactaris. Average relative abundances of the detected genes and neurometabolic signature approach did not reveal many significant differences in the metagenomes of the groups that were compared. We noted decreases in the abundance of genes linked to production of GABA, melatonine and butyric acid in the @di$ ASD @/di$ metagenomes.Conclusion. For the first time, the neurometabolic signature of the gut microbiota of young children with @di$ ASD @/di$ is presented.	1
The improvement of glucose tolerance observed with increased dietary fiber intake is linked with a higher abundance of the genus @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$. In contrast, the abundance of @gm$ Prevotella copri @/gm$ was positively associated with microbial branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis in the gut and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ with a soy protein diet which contained a low level of BCAAs. Our present study showed an increased abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and an increase in the @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$/Bacteroidetes ratio, but no differences were observed in glucose tolerance or luminal BCAA concentrations between the HFD and HFD-MX groups.	1
The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis and bronchopneumonia in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ infections is low , However, almost half of patients with acute rickettsia burgdorferi infection will develop pneumonia. The incidence of Q fever is lower, but its @di$ organ damage @/di$ is more serious and its mortality is higher. If these two diseases enter the chronic phase, it will be difficult to cure them, so early diagnosis and symptomatic treatment are very important. The mixed infection of Rickettsia burneti and Brucella melitensis is rarely reported in clinical. As far as we know, this is the first case report in China. In PubMed, we only found one similar case report. Although it is rare for patients to be infected with @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ and Rickettsia at the same time, we should not ignore this situation.	0
The inclusion criteria for the study were patients presenting with suggestive symptoms of typhoid, such as @di$ prolonged fever @/di$, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and patients with blood culture identifying @gm$ Salmonella typhi @/gm$ or serology sent for @gm$ Salmonella typhi @/gm$.	1
The increased abundance of Desulfovibrio has been linked to development of inflammatory bowel disease and @di$ autism spectrum disorder @/di$, likely caused by the accumulation of H2S. Pseudomonas spp. showed increased levels in the gut of patients with multiple sclerosis and end-stage renal disease, represented a higher positive rate in the ileum of Crohn's disease patients compared with the healthy control group, and reflected a positive correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. In addition, one member of the genus, P. aeruginosa, is a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterium that causes various infections. Therefore, the negative correlation between levels of B. pseudolongum and levels of either Psuedomonas spp. (R = -0.618) or Desulfovibrio spp. (R = -0.582) raised the question of whether administration by @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ could inhibit pathogenic Desulfovibrio and Pseudomonas.	2
The infectious bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ Streptococcus faecalis @/gm$, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and different groups of diarrhoeagenic E. coli. These infectious agents associated with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ are transmitted chiefly through the faecal-oral route, with an estimated 94% disease burden attributable to the environment and associated with risk factors such as unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation and personal hygiene.	1

The intestinal flora is critically involved in the pathogenesis of HCC by creating an anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ microenvironment, which is dependent on liver LPS. @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, Butyricimonas, Mucispirillum, Oscillibacter, Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella, and Prevotella were classified as enriched genera in this study, among which Oscillibacter species stimulate the differentiation of anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ Treg cells that produce IL-10 and Parabacteroides species have proven to withhold @di$ inflammation @/di$ by restraining inflammatory cytokines secretion and promoting the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10. Along with the aforementioned genera, species Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides distasonis, and @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ were also significantly enriched. @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ tends to modulate the gut by abating tumor growth and Bacteroides fragilis acts by stimulating Treg cells for IL-10 production.	2
The isolates were identified as strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$. The sequence data for these two isolates were submitted to the Genbank with accession numbers KP883298 and KP883297 respectively. The @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ strain (PB2) strain exhibited beta-galactosidase activity as well as L. plantrum strain (OB6). The study revealed exceptional probiotic potentials of two LAB namely Lactobacillus plantarum strain (OB6) and @gm$ Pediococcus pentosaceus @/gm$ strain (PB2) isolated from fermented sorghum products, Ogi-baba and Pito respectively. Hence, the two LAB strains may be potentially used as probiotic to prevent some enteropathogen-induced @di$ gastrointestinal disorders @/di$; reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections and for the management of lactose in intolerance.	2
The isolates which are likely to be pathogenic include strain AP1 which is phylogenetically close to Cupriavidus pauculus which causes human infections sporadically and were isolated earlier from a variety of human clinical sources and also from drinking water sources (Table 4); strains GD5 and NG1 which are phylogenetically close to Acinetobacter johnsonii which causes vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection were isolated from clinical specimens and milk (Table 4); strains AP2, AP4, GD2, JD4, KL3, KL4, MB3, R1, WN1, WN3, WN4, and WN5 which are phylogenetically close to @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$ which causes septicemia, meningitis, peritonitis, and so forth were isolated from human clinical specimens like urine (Table 4); strain MB4 which is phylogenetically close to Acinetobacter ursingii which causes @di$ bacteremia @/di$ was isolated from blood (Table 4); strain GD4 which is phylogenetically close to Aeromonas hydrophila subsp.	1
The kinetics of the bacterial loads in spleens and @di$ splenomegaly @/di$ throughout pregnancy is presented in Figure 3a,b. Both B. melitensis strains showed similar patterns of infection along pregnancy, with high levels of colonisation during the first 10 days PI that declined thereafter; the @di$ splenomegaly @/di$ increased throughout the experiment, reaching the maximum at 18.5 DG. In contrast, @gm$ B. suis bv @/gm$2 induced lower levels of spleen infections than B. melitensis during 7-10 days PI, peaking thereafter; the spleen weights of these animals increased moderately and progressively until reaching a peak at 10 days PI, dropping thereafter to the basal levels of the PBS control. PBS inoculated females also showed a peak of physiological @di$ splenomegaly @/di$ at 10 DG (0.27 g/spleen); nevertheless, @di$ splenomegaly @/di$ induced by B.	1
The latter reaches the liver to be converted by flavin monooxygenase into TMAO which serum levels are strongly associated with @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ and cardiovascular risks. In the mouse model TMAO promotes the growth of atherosclerotic plaques and acts as uraemic toxin. Microbial species can oppose the effects of TMAO such as @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$ and E.	2
The log2 fold change abundance of 169 significantly different bacterial species in fecal samples of children with @di$ CeD @/di$ and non-@di$ CeD @/di$ controls is depicted in Table 4. There were several species significantly decreased in children with @di$ CeD @/di$ belonging to the Bifidobacterium genus, such as B. breve (p = 0.0028), B. angolatum (p = 2.24-07), @gm$ B. merycicum @/gm$ (p = 0.012), and B. thermophilum (p = 0.027). Among Lactobacilli species, L. plantarum (p = 0.0043), was significantly less abundant in @di$ CeD @/di$ samples, whereas the abundance of other lactobacilli such as L. gasseri (p = 0.033) was significantly- increased in children with @di$ CeD. @/di$ Prevotella species (P. timonensis (p = 0.018); P. bergensis (p = 0.022) were significantly more abundant in stool samples of children with @di$ CeD @/di$, whereas Prevotella sp. P5-119 was significantly less abundant (p = 1.69-06). Finally, several Bacteroides species were less abundant in fecal samples from children with @di$ CeD. @/di$ In contrast, different Clostridium species were increased in abundance among children with @di$ CeD. @/di$.	1
The lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) leaf is a typical homologous ingredient of medicine and food with lipid-lowering and @di$ weight-loss @/di$ effects. In the present study, lotus leaves were fermented by two probiotics, Enterococcus faecium WEFA23 and Enterococcus hirae WEHI01, and the anti-adipogenic effect of Enterococcus fermented lotus leaf supernatant (FLLS) was evaluated in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the aim of exploring whether its anti-obesity ability will be enhanced after fermentation with @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ and to dig out the potential corresponding mechanism. The FLLS fermented by @gm$ E. hirae @/gm$ WEHI01 (FLLS-WEHI01) was selected and further investigated for its ability to inhibit obesity in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats (male, 110 +- 5 g, 4 weeks old) due to its superior inhibitory effect on adipogenesis and lipid accumulation (inhibition rate of up to 56.17%) in 3T3-L1 cells (p = 0.008 for WEHI01-L, p < 0.001 for WEHI01-H).	2
The magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (NSA) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative @di$ peritonitis @/di$ (25.8-32.3%). Children below the 6 months age group bear less risk of acquiring NSA infection. Under certain situations, metronidazole combats NSA infections in a better way than other antibacterials. The bacteriology of NSA infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. The species of normal cervix (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. Out of the 22 species of NSA isolated, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$ and Peptococcus prevotii are the commonest.	0
The main aetiological factor of genuine @di$ halitosis @/di$ is the volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) produced by oral bacteria via complex microbe-substrate and microbe-microbe interactions and putrefaction of organic substrates in the oral cavity, associated with poor oral hygiene, tongue coating and periodontal disease. In particular, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide (C2H6S) are considered significant parameters and markers of @di$ halitosis @/di$. Some microorganisms such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, @gm$ Porphyromonas gingivalis @/gm$, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola are involved in periodontal diseases and may also facilitate the production of VSC metabolism. Some studies using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and GC-MS-based metabolite profiling found that the bacterial composition, diversity and metabolites of the @di$ halitosis @/di$ group were different from those of the control group. Therefore, the anaerobic oral condition might play an important role in the development of @di$ halitosis @/di$. Consequently, regulating the balance of the oral microbiota to reduce VSC levels is important in the management of @di$ halitosis @/di$.	1
The main associations after exclusion of mixed-infections were the following: Campylobacter infections with moderate dehydration (p = 0.007); EPEC infections with @di$ vomiting @/di$ (p = 0.011) and severe dehydration (p<0.001); Salmonella infections with severe dehydration (p<0.001), fever (p = 0.016) and inclusion in a nutrition program (p<0.001); @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ infections with deaths (p = 0.003); finally rotavirus infections with @di$ vomiting @/di$ (p<0.001) and with non-inclusion in a nutrition program (p<0.001), as described elsewhere.	1
The main pathomorphological findings were hepatitis (32.8%), @di$ pneumonia @/di$ (22.2%), nephritis (19.1%), liver necrosis (12.9%), and enteritis (40.7%). An unusual main finding was steatitis (20.9%) of unknown origin. Animals were mainly emaciated and showed high infection rates with Eimeria spp. (91.3%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (36.2%). European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus reached an epidemic status with few fatal infections (4.2%) and high seroprevalence (64.9%), whereas the prevalence of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 was very low (0.8%) in hares in Schleswig-Holstein. Pathogens such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (5.9%), Pasteurella multocida (0.8%), and @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (3.4%) only caused sporadic deaths.	0
The majority of @di$ dASP @/di$ among PV could not be explained by areas of technical uncertainty (ATUs). Only a notable proportion of differing test results for ciprofloxacin susceptibility testing in E. coli could be traced back to ATUs (34%; 12/35; Table 1). The number of antimicrobial agents with differing test results was comparable for PV from almost all species. Only the median number (range) of antimicrobial agents with differing test results were higher in E. coli compared to @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ (3 [1 to 13] versus 0 [0 to 6]; P = 0.006).	0
The majority of @di$ muscle protein @/di$ extract resulted in the marked decrease in major bands and the appearance of polypeptides with molecular weights less than 20 kDa. The protein bands with sizes of approximately 245, 135, 100, 63, 48, 35, and 20 kDa decreased. The bands at 11 kDa were more intense in the three samples compared with the raw material. During ripening fermentation, the polypeptides with molecular weights of 245, 135, 63, 48, and 35 kDa showed a more intense decrease in batches B and C compared with batch A. Furthermore, the intensity of the 48 kDa band severely decreased at the end of fermentation. Zeng et al. detected a considerable @di$ muscle protein @/di$ degradation during ripening fermentation. The proteolysis in Suan rou is probably affected by elements, including product formulation, indigenous microorganisms, and processing technology, due to the action of proteinases from @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ or LAB and the hydrolysis of muscle proteins caused by acids (Astiasaran et al.,).	0
The majority of the articles from cluster #4 are about the regulation of ocular surface health and ocular surface diseases such as @di$ Sjogren's syndrome @/di$ and dry eye syndrome. And over half of these representative citing articles in this section ( Table 8 ) were completed by Moon J and colleagues, including two original articles and one review. Of note, IRT5, a mixed probiotic consisting of Lactobacillus casei, @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$, Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus thermophilus, was mentioned to potentially decrease the severity of experimental dry eye model, which indicated that probiotics might be an effective means to treat disease by intervening with the gut microbiota.	2
The microorganism isolated was Salmonella in 61% of the cases, Campylobacter in 20% and @gm$ Yersinia enterocolitica @/gm$ in 13%. Ninety-three per cent of the patients had @di$ diarrhea @/di$, 74% had fever (> 38 degrees C), and 66% abdominal pain. Blood in stools was most frequent in patients infected with Campylobacter. Leukocytosis was rare. Twenty-four patients had bacteremia. Reactive arthritis occurred in 4.8%. Three patients died, all infected with zoonotic Salmonella types. Three stool cultures were made for 115 patients, and in 73% all 3 cultures were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial gastroenteritis requiring hospitalization affects mainly children and young adults. Infections due to zoonotic Salmonella types were more severe than Campylobacter and @gm$ Y. enterocolitica @/gm$ gastroenteritis.	1
The mode of transmission of @gm$ M. ulcerans @/gm$ has not been fully elucidated, but inoculation into the subcutaneous tissues probably occurs through penetrating skin trauma. BU has not been linked with HIV infection. Antimycobacterial drug treatment is ineffective, and treatment is surgical. Patients eventually develop scars and @di$ contractures @/di$, with resulting disabilities, and the disease imposes a large burden on affected populations.	1
The modulatory effects of polyphenols in the gut microbiota, especially the stimulation of relative levels of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ and its impact on glucose metabolism and inflammation, were studied in @di$ obese @/di$ men with metabolic syndrome. The authors showed that oral supplementation of 1000 mg of resveratrol twice daily for 30 days improved glucose homeostasis in Caucasians but not in non-Caucasian @di$ obese @/di$ men. Only in Caucasians, significant increases in relative levels of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ were observed, coupled with improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. It is worth noting that at baseline, the two groups presented with variable gut microbiota; on the one hand, Caucasian subjects had a higher concentration of Collinsella, Clostridiaceae, and Ruminococcus spp. than non-Caucasians, whereas Streptococcus and Lactobacillales spp. were over-represented in non-Caucasians. However, owing to the variability in the plasma levels of dihydroresveratrol, the primary resveratrol metabolite, the racial differences observed in the metabolic changes and relative @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ abundance were not sustained, indicating that additional mechanisms other than microbial metabolism of phenolics could support the changes in @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ gut colonization and the improvements in glucose homeostasis.	2
The most common MSK manifestation was @di$ arthritis @/di$ (61%), followed by osteomyelitis (50%), tenosynovitis (25%), and spondylodiscitis (14%). The most common organism was M. abscessus (18%), and @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ (18%), followed by M.	0
The most common bacterial pathogen recovered from blood/synovial fluid is @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$, accounting for 80% of @di$ pyogenic sacroiliitis @/di$ in children. Salmonella sp. is a rare cause of @di$ pyogenic sacroiliitis @/di$. However, a recent review of 23 pediatric cases of Salmonella sacroiliitis reported in the English literature found the infection to be more prevalent in female adolescents who typically presented with back pain and fever that, once recognized, had a favorable therapeutic outcome. Since this review, one further case report of S. enteritidis @di$ sacroiliitis @/di$, notably with hepatitis as in our case, was identified (Table 1).	1
The most common causative microorganisms were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, @gm$ Klebsiella pneumoniae @/gm$ and Staphylococcus aureus. The most frequent sources of infection came from intra-abdominal (gastro-intestinal as well as hepato-biliary), urinary and respiratory tract. Its overall mortality was 34.7%. Factors associated with a higher mortality from septicemia were old age, rapidly fatal underlying disease, hospital acquired infection, hypothermia, hypotension/@di$ shock @/di$, high-risk source of infection (from respiratory tract, skin/soft tissue, surgical wound or other unknown source), high-risk microorganisms (Candida species, Ps. aeruginosa or @gm$ K. Pneumoniae @/gm$) and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy.	1
The most common comorbidities were active cancer, diabetes, and @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$. Septic shock was present in 45% of patients while 29.7% required mechanical ventilation. The most common sources of infection were pneumonia (27.7%) and urinary tract (22.0%). Inappropriate antibiotic therapy was administered to 25.4% of patients, while Enterobacteriaceae and S aureus accounted for the highest number of infections in our sample. Candida was responsible for 10.1% of the infectious episodes and Pseudomonas spp and @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp accounted for the majority of nonfermenters (85.0%).	1
The most common infection in cancer patients was RTI (55.8%), mainly in @di$ leukemic @/di$ patients, followed by SI (18%), only in solid-tumor patients, GITI (9.7%), BSI (9.4%), and UTI (7.1%). The most frequent isolates of Fusobacterium necrophorum (32.7%) and Eubacterium lentum (23.8%) were mostly recovered from solid-tumor patients. These were followed by Clostridium perfringens (11.9%), Clostridium difficile (10.9%), @gm$ Eubacterium limosum @/gm$ (5.9%), and Veillonella parvula (5%).	0
The most common sites from which anaerobes were isolated were @di$ abscesses @/di$ (32% of @di$ abscesses @/di$ cultured contained species of obligate anaerobes), peritoneal exudates (24%), and pleural effusions (20%). Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and @gm$ Bacteroides ruminicola @/gm$ accounted in the aggregate for approximately 50% of all anaerobic isolates.	1
The most common sites from which anaerobes were isolated were abscesses (32% of abscesses cultured contained species of obligate anaerobes), peritoneal exudates (24%), and @di$ pleural effusions @/di$ (20%). Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and @gm$ Bacteroides ruminicola @/gm$ accounted in the aggregate for approximately 50% of all anaerobic isolates.	1
The most common species was @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$. Other species included Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kansasii and some unspecified species. However, M. haemophilum was not specifically mentioned. In contrast, in developed countries, M. avium complex was common while rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) was found less than in Asia. To date, there are only a few reports of M. haemophilum infections from Thailand. The first was a series of patients who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but had disseminated NTM infection associated with @di$ Sweet's syndrome @/di$.	0
The most commonly isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (43 cases, 52.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11 cases, 13.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11 cases, 13.4%), Serratia marcescens (4 cases, 4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases, 4.9%), and @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ (3 cases, 3.7%). We found no cases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae or @di$ Chlamydia trachomatis infection @/di$.	0
The most commonly isolated single pathogens were coagulase negative staphylococci with 28 isolates of which nine were multiresistant, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for eleven cases (four MRSA) and enterococci for nine cases (one @gm$ E. faecium @/gm$). Gram negative rods were cultured in twelve cases. The most common cause of sepsis originating from IAI was graft pancreatitis with 10 cases, followed by @di$ peritonitis @/di$ in five cases and infected ascites in two cases.	1
The most commonly reported symptoms among patients with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed infection included fever (in 97%), nausea/vomiting (in 50%), @di$ weakness @/di$/malaise (in 38%), headache (in 35%), abdominal pain (in 32%), diarrhea (in 29%), and cough (in 29%; Table 2). A higher proportion of patients infected with @gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$ presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, compared with patients infected with S.	1
The most frequently isolated germs were @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ (51%), Streptococcus pyogenes (11.5%), Anaerobes (6.5%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (6.5%). Paracentesis, puncture of retro auricular abscess under local anesthesia, and peroperative samples all contributed to isolate the involved germ(s). All the patients were hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics, and 36.2% (n=68) underwent surgery. Several surgical procedures were necessary in 4 cases (2.1%). AM recurrences requiring a second hospitalization were observed in 8 patients (4.3%). The only observed complication was @di$ lateral sinus thrombosis @/di$ (n=6; 3.2%). Surgical failures, requiring more than one surgical procedure, were more frequent in case of: (i) presence of Anaerobes (p<=0.001) or Gram-negative bacteria (p<=0.05) in microbiological samples; (ii) surgical drainage without mastoidectomy (p<=0.001). Recurrences were more frequent in AM due to @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$.	1
The most prevalent bacterial pathogen causing CAP is the Gram-positive bacterium, @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$ (@gm$ Spn @/gm$). Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia are at high risk for progression to life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite antibiotic therapy. Notwithstanding decades of investigations on host-pathogen interactions, further research is needed in order to identify new approaches against the development of ARDS in @di$ pneumonia @/di$.	1
The most prevalent lesions in PFTS-SICK pigs were superficial lymphocytic fundic gastritis, atrophic enteritis, superficial @di$ colitis @/di$, lymphocytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, mild nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and thymic atrophy. Rotavirus A and Betacoronavirus 1 (Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) were identified only in PFTS-SICK pigs, but the significance of the viruses is uncertain because PFTS is not consistent with the typical presentation following infection by these pathogens. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine circovirus-2, Influenza A virus, Alphacoronavirus 1 (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus), Torque teno virus 1, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$ were not identified in PFTS-SICK pigs.	0
The most prominent member of this group, serotype @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$, is a well-recognized cause of hemorrhagic colitis and @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$. This serious human pathogen has caused numerous outbreaks in the developed world and has contaminated such widely disparate foods as ground beef, apple cider, and lettuce. Serotypes other than @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ have also been found to cause sporadic enteric disease and several outbreaks have been recently described. The non-O157 SLTEC are more frequently present in food animals and foods of animal origin than serotype @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$. Particular non-O157 serotypes (such as O26) have a definite association with @di$ HUS @/di$. Surveillance data from several regions suggests that there may be important differences in the distribution of serotypes causing @di$ HUS @/di$ in different geographic areas.	1
The mucosa-attached microbiome was assessed in ileal tissue of one @di$ CF @/di$ patient previously undergone surgery for DIOS and in ileal biopsies from seven non-@di$ CF @/di$ patients (see Methods). Microbial evenness and diversity were reduced almost tenfold in the @di$ CF @/di$ patient, comprising a total number of 25 ASVs compared to an average 239 ASVs in control samples (Supplementary Table S9B). Dysbiosis in the ileal mucosa-attached microbiome of the @di$ CF @/di$ patient was characterised by the increased abundance of an ASV within the @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ complex. This accounted for 97.6% relative abundance in the @di$ CF @/di$ ileal sample compared to an average 5.3% in control samples (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S9A). This ASV shared 100% sequence identity to strains of multiple Pseudomonas species including P. antarctica, P. azotoformans, P. costantinii, P. extremorientalis, @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$, P. poae, P. simiae, P. tolaasii and P. trivialis; all members of the @gm$ P. fluorescens @/gm$ complex. Of note, this ASV did not share 100% sequence similarity with any strains of the dominant @di$ CF @/di$ lung pathogen P. aeruginosa. Other ASVs more abundant in the @di$ CF @/di$ microbiome included low abundance genera Enterococcus (@di$ CF @/di$, 1%; non-@di$ CF @/di$; 0.01%) and Finegoldia (@di$ CF @/di$, 0.2%; non-@di$ CF @/di$, 0.0004%) (Fig.	1
The neonate was put on oral rehydration due to @di$ respiratory @/di$ problems. After day 5 of life, the infant was put on a ventilator and developed sepsis with meningitis after development of grunting, episodic apnoea, chest retraction, and tachypnoea. Cerebrospinal fluid samples exhibited a high protein concentration, low glucose concentration, and elevated leukocyte count. The infant started an antibiotics chemotherapy of ciprofloxacin and netilmicin after a positive blood culture for @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$.	1
The number of specimens cultured was 116 from airways (nose, 42; pharynx, 42; sputum, 32), 24 from @di$ decubitus ulcer @/di$, 40 from urine, 42 from feces, a total of 125 from skin (head, 42; forearm, 42; inguinal region, 41), and 84 from the hospital environment (floor swab, 42; settled agar plate, 42), respectively. A total of 15 species were isolated from the hospital environment. Some species were the same as those which were recovered from the hospital environment were those observed on each body site. In the hospital environment, the isolation rates of @gm$ Acinetobacter baumanii @/gm$ and Klebsiella pneumoniae were significantly high in the settled agar plate (@gm$ A. baumanii @/gm$, p < 0.01; K.	0
The one exception is @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$, which was first isolated from patients with @di$ pneumonia @/di$ in the USA 40 years ago. In some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, where the aetiology of community-acquired @di$ pneumonia @/di$ has been systematically studied, L.	1
The order of the most common etiologic agents causing nosocomial infections, in particular HAP, @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$ and sepsis was slightly different in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 period: Enterococcus faecium (19%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), Serratia marcescens (8%), Burkholderia multivorans (7%) and @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ (6%). Changes in the percentages of bacterial species from the total number of etiological agents causing HAP, @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$ and sepsis during the pandemic, as compared with the similar pre-COVID-19 period, are shown in Figure 2. While considerable increases are seen in Enterococcus faecium (from 6% to 19%, p < 0.0001), @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$ (from 1% to 6%, p = 0.0004) and Serratia marcescens (from 1% to 8%, p < 0.0001), there were significant decreases in Escherichia coli (from 10% to 3%, p < 0.0001), Proteus mirabilis (from 5% to 2%, p = 0.004) and Staphylococcus aureus (from 5% to 2%, p = 0.004).	1
The organisms usually involved in such infections are Vibrio species, @gm$ Aeromonas hydrophila @/gm$, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, and components of the flora of the human skin. Irrigation, exploration, and culture of these wounds as well as immunization of the patient against tetanus are recommended. Patients with hepatic disease or chronic illness and immunocompromised individuals are at unusually high risk of fulminant infection due to Vibrio and @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ species and should be treated with antibiotics after sustaining a water-associated wound. Patients with normal host defense mechanisms but with late wound care, punctures involving a bone or a joint, progressive inflammation hours after envenomation, @di$ fever @/di$, or signs of sepsis are at high risk for secondary infection and should receive definitive wound care and antibiotics.	1
The other causes included hypercalciuria (N = 6), @di$ hydronephrosis @/di$ (N = 3), glomerulonephritis (N = 1), Wilms tumor (N = 1), and renal angiomyolipoma (N = 1). However, the cause of hematuria was not identified in most of the cases (N = 112, 69.6%). The top two infectious pathogens responsible for UTIs in our study were Escherichia coli (N = 12) and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 3). The other pathogens included @gm$ Enterobacter aerogenes @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Citrobacter koseri, Yeast, and GPB, each counted as 1.	0
The overabundance of Prevotella species at mucosal sites was suggested to be associated with some localized and systemic diseases, including @di$ periodontitis @/di$, bacterial vaginosis, rheumatoid arthritis and low-grade systemic inflammation. Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra in feces have been found related to colorectal cancer. Multiple evidences suggest that the GC-depleted taxa Bifidobacterium, @gm$ Bacillus @/gm$ and Blautia might be putative probiotics. Bifidobacterium longum was reported to exhibit anti-proliferation and anti-angiogenesis effect against gastric cancer by downregulating COX2 expression. Moreover, clinical trials were conducted using Bifidobacterium as probiotic supplement with antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors to eradicate H. pylori. The antagonistic activity of Bacillus spp. has been explored against large number of pathogens. One study also reported the anti H. pylori activity of tested probiotic @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ strains, which was attributed to the secretion of aninocoumacin A antibiotic.	2
The overall observed frequency (52.4%) of staphylococci isolates was significantly greater than the expected frequency (44.5%) in the periodontitis group (Chi-square test, p < 0.001), but not in healthy or @di$ gingivitis @/di$ patients (Fig. 1A). Regardless of the clinical condition, the predominant species were S. epidermidis (59%) and S. aureus (22%), followed by S. capitis (3.6%) and S. warneri (2.8%) at much lower prevalence. Nevertheless, the observed frequencies of S. epidermidis (69%), S. aureus (63%) and S. capitis (77%) were significantly higher than the expected frequency (33%) for patients with periodontitis (Chi-square test, p < 0.05). Of interest, a few isolates of S. saprophyticus predominated in subgingival samples from healthy individuals, whereas isolates of S. condimenti, S. hominis, S. simulans, @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ were identified only in samples from periodontal diseases (Fig.	1
"The pH value of a biofilm influences the pathogenesis and therapy of oral diseases such as caries and @di$ periodontitis @/di$. This study aimed to investigate the influence of different initial pH values on the microbial composition, bacterial counts, metabolic activity, and quantity of three defined biofilms representing oral health, caries, and periodontal disease. Respective bacterial suspensions in the nutrient broth were initially adjusted to pH values between 5 and 8. Then biofilms were cultured on polystyrene surfaces coated with a proteinaceous solution for 2 h (""healthy"" biofilm), 6 h (""healthy,"" and ""cariogenic"" biofilms), 24 h (""cariogenic,"" and ""@di$ periodontitis @/di$"" biofilms), and 48 h (""@di$ periodontitis @/di$"" biofilm). In all biofilms, total bacterial counts were lower at an initial pH of 5 or 5.5 than at higher pH values. In the biofilm representing caries, the percentage of cariogenic bacteria (@gm$ Streptococcus mutans @/gm$, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was higher at a low pH, the metabolic activity was highest at pH 6-6.5, and biofilm mass was greatest at pH 7-7.5. In the biofilm representing @di$ periodontitis @/di$, the percentage of Porphyromonas gingivalis increased with the pH. Also, the metabolic activity was highest at pH 8, whereas mass had the highest value at pH 7. In conclusion, the initial pH value influences biofilm formation. In particular, metabolic activity and the amount of bacteria associated with disease correlated with the respective pH known to be of importance in the development of caries (relatively low pH) and @di$ periodontitis @/di$ (higher pH). Modifying the pH level in oral biofilms might be an alternative concept in (primary) prevention and treatment, not only of caries but also of @di$ periodontitis @/di$."	1
The paraprobiotic role of @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ for athletes has been found to restore fatigue and reduce @di$ anxiety @/di$ (Figure 4). @gm$ Lactobacillus gasseri @/gm$ functions to increase protein synthesis activity in EIF2 signaling known as an adaptive pathway for integrated stress response.	2
The past decade has highlighted the central role of the gut microbiome in many @di$ immune-mediated diseases @/di$. In IBD, the gut microbiome demonstrates reduced diversity, expansion of pro-inflammatory bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacteriaceae and depletion of phyla with anti-inflammatory effects such as Firmicutes. Clinical observations of resolution of intestinal inflammation with fecal diversion and exacerbation following restoration of luminal continuity further support this concept. In RA, altered T-lymphocyte response due to segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) in the gut plays an important role. A similar reduction in diversity and depletion of Ruminococcus is seen in psoriatic arthritis as in IBD. Thus, given its role in the pathogenesis of these @di$ immune-mediated diseases @/di$, taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiome may influence likelihood of response to immuno-modulatory therapy for these diseases. An effect of the microbiome on therapy response has been demonstrated previously whereby inactivation of digoxin by @gm$ Eggerthella lenta @/gm$ resulted in altered drug pharmacokinetics and reduced serum concentration.	1
The pathogenicity of @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ is caused by a type III secretion system (TTSS) and act gene. TTSS enables the delivery of toxins inside the host cells. A type II-secreted cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) which has hemolytic and cytotoxic functions is encoded by the act gene. These virulence factors are linked to clinical infection and play a key role in the disease process. @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ also has the enzymes elastase and pectinaseare. These enzymes act on the immune system and cause tissue destruction and hemolysis. The majority of Aeromonas infections usually present as gastroenteritis with the symptoms of acute watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea. The infections are self-limiting with mild dehydration. Aeromonas infections are also known to cause hemolytic urmeic syndrome, meningitis, @di$ peritonitis @/di$, wound infections, respiratory tract infection, ocular diseases, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, @di$ peritonitis @/di$ and cholangitis.	1
The patient developed @di$ seizures @/di$ and flaccid hemiparesis on day +10. Meningoencephalitis induced by @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ was diagnosed. The treatment consisted of appropriate antibiotics, G-CSF and removal of the central venous line. Infection control and nearly full neurological recovery was achieved. Immunocompromised patients susceptible to B. cereus infection, indicated by the isolation of @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ in prior cultures, should receive antibiotic treatment covering @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$.	1
The patient had a history of multiple @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ treated with ceftazidime, rifampin, gentamicin, or intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric vancomycin and gentamicin. Blood cultures grew out @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ and SCV @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ by MALDI-TOF and therapy was switched to cefepime. Additionally, the patient received ceftazidime line-lock therapy. The patient completed treatment and recovered fully. Though the isolates were resulted out as @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$, they were later identified as E.	1
The patient pre-FMT carried higher relative abundances of putatively pathogenetic species, such as Clostridium innocuum (associated with extra-intestinal clostridial infection), Clostridium symbiosum (associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma), Clostridium clostridioforme (involved in bacteremia), @gm$ Veillonella parvula @/gm$ (producing lipopolysaccharide, which is the main virulence factor that leads to @di$ meningitis @/di$), Flavonifractor plautii (associated with colorectal cancer), and Ruminococcus gnavus (associated with Crohn's disease).	1
"The patient was a 73-year-old man with laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension with a 4-week history of @di$ cervical pain @/di$, sore throat, and fever. Computed tomography showed fluid collection on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identified Bacteroides pyogenes, Lactobacillus salivarius, and @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ from abscess aspiration. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing re-identified the Bacteroides species as ""B. denticanum"". T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed a high signal intensity adjacent to the anterior vertebral body of C3-C7. The diagnosis was peripharyngeal esophageal anastomotic abscess and acute vertebral osteomyelitis caused by ""B. denticanum"", L. salivarius, and @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$."	1
The patient was severely affected at the time of admission with high fever, @di$ tachypnea @/di$, tachycardia and peripheral cyanosis. The condition worsened despite treatment with antibiotics as well as respiratory and pressure support. Acidosis and critical leucopenia supervened and the patient died just short of 24 hours after admission. Subsequent bacterial cultivation showed Panton-Valentine Leucocidin-producing @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$.	1
The pattern of actin condensation was different from that produced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli but similar to that produced by @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$. Invasion and actin condensation were poor for the third isolate. Histology of adult rabbit small intestinal loops inoculated with all three isolates revealed bacterial attachment to, penetration of, and microulcer formation on the surface epithelium and hyperemia, @di$ edema @/di$, and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration of lamina propria.	1
The periodontal status of 25 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (age range 58 to 76) was investigated and compared with 40 non-@di$ diabetic @/di$ control subjects (age range 59 to 77). Surfaces with visible plaque and bleeding after probing, calculus, recessions, and pathological pockets were examined. The total attachment loss was calculated as a sum of recessions and pockets in millimeters. Mesial and distal bone loss was measured from panoramic radiographs and mean alveolar bone loss was calculated. Periodontal disease was considered advanced when mean alveolar bone loss was over 50%, or 2 or more teeth had pockets > or = 6 mm. Microbiological analysis comprised the detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and @gm$ Bacteroides forsythus @/gm$ by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Patients with NIDDM had significantly more often advanced periodontitis than control subjects, 40.0% and 12.5%, respectively. @di$ Diabetic @/di$ patients did not harbor more pathogens than the control subjects.	1
The phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin was confirmed in 32 out of 43 isolates (74.4%, CI 95%: 59.8-85.1%), and aminoglycoside resistance, conferred by aadE-Cc and aph(3')-III gene, was noted in 11.6% (CI 95%: 5.1-24.5%) of @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ isolates. The aadE-Cc gene was found only among 2/7 C. coli isolates from @di$ diarrhea @/di$ samples, whereas the aph(3')-III gene was present both in C.	1
The phylogenetically related species of the @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ group include: @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides and two recently described species, B. pseudomycoides and B. weihenstephanensis . @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis have been the most characterized due to their pathogenic nature. B. anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax, B. thuringiensis is an insect pathogen, and @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ can be associated with a variety of human infections. @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ is most frequently associated with food poisoning, characterized by strains producing emetic or diarrheal toxins. It is also an opportunistic pathogen resulting in localized (wound, ocular, oral) and systemic infections (bacteremia, septicemia, endocarditis, @di$ meningitis @/di$, pneumonia) especially in immunocompromised patients. However, although @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ is ubiquitous in the environment, particularly soil, it does not generally pose a health threat.	1
The physiological and immune changes that occur during pregnancy are associated with worsened disease outcomes during infection and @di$ sepsis @/di$. How these perturbations exacerbate inflammation has not been explored. Here, using antibiotic treatment and fecal microbial transfers, we showed that @di$ sepsis @/di$ susceptibility is driven by pregnancy-induced changes to gut microbiome in mice and humans. Integrative multiomics and genetically engineered bacteria revealed that reduced @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ (@gm$ P. merdae @/gm$) abundance during pregnancy led to decreased formononetin (FMN) and increased macrophage death. Mechanistically, FMN inhibited macrophage pyroptosis by suppressing nuclear accumulation of hnRNPUL2 and subsequent binding to the Nlrp3 promoter. Treatment with FMN or deletion of murine hnRNPUL2 protected against septic inflammation. Intestinal abundances of @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ and FMN inversely correlated with the progression of septic patients. Our data reveal a microbe-immune axis that is disrupted in pregnant septic hosts, highlighting the potential of the FMN-hnRNPUL2-NLRP3 axis in providing promising therapeutic strategies for @di$ sepsis @/di$.	2
The plaque flora was studied in adult mongrel and beagle dogs with @di$ periodontal disease @/di$. Gingival plaque from maxillary premolars was removed and cultured on various growth media. The flora in all dogs was composed of mostly anaerobic gram negative rods. @gm$ Bacteroides asaccharolyticus @/gm$ was found in the highest proportion of plaque samples from mongrel dogs, and decomposed hydrogen peroxide suggesting catalase activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum was found in higher proportion in the plaque of beagle dogs as compared to @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$. With the increasing numbers of obligative anaerobic gram negative organisms such as @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$, the proportions of Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus decreased in the dogs with @di$ periodontal disease @/di$. The salivary flora was different from the plaque flora of the dogs with @di$ periodontal disease @/di$. It was constant regardless with the disease. The salivary flora of beagle dogs with the healthy gingiva was different from that of mongrel dogs. Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Eubacterium and black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB, mainly @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$) were higher proportion in the flora of beagle dogs as compared to mongrel dogs, while Fusobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, yeast and molds were lower in the flora. The results reveal that @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$ and F.	1
The populations of Enterococcus faecium and @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ were higher in IBD/D+-F vs. IBD/D--F. Among these bacteria, Klebsiella oxytoca caused colitis and anxiety/@di$ depression @/di$ in SPF mice most potently, followed by Escherichia coli and Cronobacter sakazakii. Klebsiella oxytoca yielded the highest level of mortality in SPF mice. Interestingly, these bacteria at a low dose caused anxiety with colitis, while @di$ depression @/di$ with colitis was caused at a high dose. The occurrence of @di$ depression @/di$ and colitis after exposure to Klebsiella oxytoca was more severe in germ-free mice than in specific pathogen-free mice: the occurrence of @di$ depression @/di$ by Klebsiella oxytoca at a dose of 1 x 107 CFU/mouse/day in germ-free mice was similar to that detected in specific-pathogen-free mice at a dose of 1 x 108 CFU/mouse/day. However, Enterococcus faecium, @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$, and Bifidobacterium longum did not significantly cause colitis and anxiety/@di$ depression @/di$. Hogenauer et al. reported that Klebsiella oxytoca may be a causative organism of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Jang et al. reported that antibiotics-induced Klebseilla oxytoca and its lipopolysaccharide caused colitis and anxiety in mice. Jang et al. also reported that IS-induced Escherichia coli and its lipopolysaccharide caused colitis and @di$ depression @/di$ in mice. These results suggest that the occurrence of anxiety/@di$ depression @/di$ with colitis by Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, or Cronobacter sakazakii, may be dependent on their titers overgrown in the gastrointestinal tract.	0
The potential of the strain to modulate the intestinal microbiota in healthy or dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mouse models was also investigated. Strain D13 decreased the disease activity index (DAI) and altered the gut microbiota of mice with DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ by increasing the ratio of beneficial microbial species (Allobaculum, @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$) and decreasing those associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Candidatus Saccharimonas). This suggests that strain D13 helps to restore the gut microbiota after DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$, indicating its potential for further investigation as a probiotic strain for the prevention and treatment of @di$ colitis @/di$.	2
The predominance of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ in @di$ shoulder infections @/di$ has been linked with the presence of the axillary lymph nodes. Culturing of the epidermis during revision surgery found that 16/18 males had P. acnes infection, whereas only 7/12 female subjects tested positive. Further studies have revealed that male gender and prior prosthetic implants are significant risk factors for @di$ P. acnes infection of the shoulder @/di$. The male predisposition, of over 2.5 times higher risk than females after shoulder arthroplasty, has been linked with the habitat of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ being within the hair follicles and, therefore, the upper body of males would harbor more of the bacterium. Moreover, males lacking signs of infection have a higher risk of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ positive cultures during arthroplasty.	1
The presence of a dysbiotic microbiota involving common skin bacteria is also seen in human chronic wounds for which there are underlying causes, such as @di$ diabetes @/di$ or venous insufficiencies. In the fourth subgroup indicating dysbiosis, including several severe, but no mild, UCD samples, a more anaerobic microbiota was observed, including bacterial species such as Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum and @gm$ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica @/gm$. These bacteria have previously been identified in bacteriological studies of UCD and, in line with our results, Sorge et al. found a higher abundance of these bacteria in UCD samples compared to control samples. Finding these opportunistic bacteria in severe UCD lesions is not surprising as they are associated with several bacterial conditions in ruminants, such as interdigital phlegmon, abscesses and wound infections. In chronic wounds, the local environment is associated with low oxygen levels that enable the growth of these bacteria. In addition, Fusobacteria and @gm$ Porphyromonas @/gm$ are commonly found in combination and, in a laboratory setting, have been shown to form biofilm and could therefore impair the healing of wounds.	1
The presence of several consumers for electron acceptors is potentially relevant for colonization resistance to @di$ Salmonella infections @/di$, which has been shown to require them during initial gut colonization. As potential nitrogen or carbon sources, amino acids were predominant among the private goods. For example, histidine was consumed only by @gm$ B. coccoides @/gm$, the genome of which encodes a degradation pathway that produces glutamate and formate from histidine. Thus, histidine could be used by @gm$ B. coccoides @/gm$ as a biomass precursor, as a nitrogen source, or to produce formate as an electron donor.	2
The present analyses focus on the 28 participants diagnosed with @di$ diabetes @/di$-14 taking metformin- and the 84 participants without @di$ diabetes @/di$ who were matched (3-to-1) to participants with @di$ diabetes @/di$ by sex, age, and BMI. We measured demographic information, anthropometry, and blood biochemical parameters and collected fecal samples from which we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. RESULTS: We found an association between @di$ diabetes @/di$ and gut microbiota that was modified by metformin use. Compared with participants without @di$ diabetes @/di$, participants with @di$ diabetes @/di$ taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbiota known for mucin degradation, and several gut microbiota known for production of SCFAs, including Butyrivibrio, @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$, Megasphaera, and an operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella. In contrast, compared with participants without @di$ diabetes @/di$, participants with @di$ diabetes @/di$ not taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Clostridiaceae 02d06 and a distinct operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella and a lower abundance of Enterococcus casseliflavus.	2
The present research revolves around a newly identified @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ strain, Pediococcus acidilactici CECT 9879 (pA1c), a Gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria, Previous experimental works on other PA strains showed good probiotic properties, including tolerance to acid and bile salts, and resistance to gastrointestinal simulated conditions, good aggregation, coaggregation and adhesion properties, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and production of bacteriocins. In addition, animal studies have indicated beneficial effects on models of constipation, infection with Clostridium difficile, colitis, and dermatitis. However, to our knowledge, its antidiabetic properties have not yet been investigated. Following this target, this study deals with the in vivo antidiabetic activity of a @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ strain (pA1c) in @di$ diabetic @/di$ mice, induced by high fat diet (HFD).	2
The present results also revealed that in Yorkshire piglets, @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ was the second dominant SRB, which was similar to the composition found in the human gut. However, in Meishan piglets, D. piger was the second dominant SRB in the cecum. Interestingly, the two bacteria may be potentially opportunistic pathogens. @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ can induce @di$ hepatic abscesses @/di$ and perforated appendicitis.	1
The present study demonstrated that the application of @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ and Salicylic acid lessens the damaging effects of @di$ water deficiency @/di$ on Canola's germination, morphological, physiological, and biochemical parameters.	2
The present study is the first comprehensive analysis of bacterial EV compositions undertaken to reveal the systemic proportion of bacterial EV in @di$ AD @/di$ patients. Alicyclobacillus, Propionibacterium and Streptophyta(o) were increased in @di$ AD @/di$ patients, and Lactococcus, @gm$ Leuconostoc @/gm$ and Lactobacillus were significantly higher in the control group than in the @di$ AD @/di$ patient group. These data indicate that a deficiency in systemic beneficial bacteria may promote development of @di$ AD @/di$. In @di$ AD @/di$ patients, Alicyclobacillus and Comamonadaceae(f) were more frequent in urine before treatment, and Acinetobacter and Oxalobacteraceae(f) were more frequent after treatment. Then, we used L. plantarum to confirm the beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria. In vitro examinations confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of Lp EVs and their ability to prevent cell death. In vivo, Lp EV decreased epidermal thickening and IL-4 levels in the S. aureus EV-induced @di$ AD @/di$ model.	2
The prevalence and severity of cockle, a sheep pelt defect characterised by @di$ raised lumps @/di$, was assessed on lambs that were either louse-infested (Bovicola ovis) or louse-free at birth. Assessments were made on pickled pelts, 10 months after the lambs had entered the trial. Lambs kept free of lice did not develop cockle, whereas the defect was common in lambs (about 90%) that were infested with lice. There was a direct correlation between louse scores and cockle, high louse scores being associated with a more severe degree of cockle. The results give support to the strong causal relationship between @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and cockle, but questions such as the minimum number of lice needed to cause cockle and the time required for cockle to develop still need to be answered.	1
The prevalence of bacterial pathogens and rotavirus in 2,908 patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ who were admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila in 1983 and 1984 was determined. One or more enteric pathogens were isolated or detected in samples from 1,698 (58.4%) patients. Isolation rates for the various enteropathogens were as follows: rotavirus, 30.6%; Shigella spp., 11.6%; Salmonella spp., 9.2%; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (1983 only), 7.8%; Vibrio cholerae biotype eltor, 3.8%; non-O1 V. cholerae, 2.8%; Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 1.7%; other Vibrio spp., 1.1%; Campylobacter jejuni, 3.0%; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1.3%; and @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ 1.1%. Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica were detected in 0.6 and 0.1%, respectively, of stool samples examined. Determination of the etiologic role of isolates was complicated by one or more of the following factors: isolation of multiple enteric pathogens (302 cases); isolation of Salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic E. coli, and C. jejuni from a similar proportion of asymptomatic control patients and patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$; and isolation of a high proportion of certain pathogens (especially Salmonella spp.) only from enrichment broth, suggesting infection with a small number of organisms. Isolation of V. cholerae eltor was seasonal, with the majority of cases occurring in the rainy months. In addition, the number of patients with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ increased with the onset of the monsoon rains and peaked during the months of maximum rainfall. Rotavirus infection occurred in both children and adults throughout the year and was the most frequently identified cause of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in children under 5 years of age. Shigella spp. were the most common agents of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in adults.	1
The promotion of DC maturation, increased cytokine secretion, and stimulation of the DC-IL-12-Th1-skewing immune response are reported as effects of @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$. Moreover, this genus is found to enhance the overall function of DC, fostering the activation and survival of tumor-specific T cells. The Th1-skewing activation mediated by the DC-IL-12 axis contributes to the improvement of the therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade. Interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma) production can be improved by enhancing the biosynthesis of immune-stimulating molecules and metabolites, and oral @gm$ bifidobacterium @/gm$ enhances tumor suppression to the same extent as specific antibody PD-L1 immunotherapy. @gm$ Bifidobacterium bifidum @/gm$ significantly upregulates the secretion levels of IFN-gamma and promotes the production of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Activation of CD8+ T cells and DCs results in enhanced efficacy of immunotherapy against melanoma, NSCLC, and @di$ Renal Cell Carcinoma @/di$ (@di$ RCC @/di$).	2
The purpose of this study was to describe the microflora and clinical parameters of young adults with minor to moderate @di$ periodontitis @/di$ during treatment for a period of 1 year. Eleven patients 15 to 16 years of age were studied. All of them had 4 to 8 mm loss of attachment at minimally one site, but the typical clinical description of localized juvenile periodontitis was an exclusion criterion in this study. Microbiological examination of the deepest @di$ periodontal @/di$ pocket and of the tongue revealed that 6 patients harbored Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 5 harbored Porphyromonas gingivalis. Almost all subjects showed relatively high proportions of @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$, Campylobacter rectus, motile organisms, and spirochetes. On the basis of clinical and microbiological parameters the 11 patients could be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Six cases had moderate @di$ periodontal breakdown @/di$ with loss of attachment at 7 to 44 sites. All harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans and 5 of them P. gingivalis. These 6 cases responded relatively well to initial treatment despite the continued presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. The other group consisted of 5 cases with relatively minor @di$ periodontal breakdown @/di$; i.e, 1 or 2 sites with 4 to 6 mm loss of attachment.	1
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of spirochetes in asymptomatic infected root canals and in endodontic abscesses/@di$ cellulitis @/di$. Aseptic clinical samples were collected using paper points from 54 infected root canals and from aspirates of 84 abscesses/@di$ cellulitis @/di$. Oligonucleotide primers were produced for PCR identification of @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$, T. pectinovorum, T. medium, T. amylovorum, T. denticola, T. maltophilum, and T. socranskii. PCR detected spirochetes in 51 of 84 (60.7%) samples from abscesses/@di$ cellulitis @/di$ and in 20 of 54 (37.0%) samples from asymptomatic infected root canals. T. socranskii was the most frequently detected (44.9%), followed by T. maltophilum (29.7%), T. denticola (28.9%), T. pectinovorum (13.7%), and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ (5.1%). The number of treponema species detected ranged from 1 to 5 species per sample. The mean numbers of species detected were 2.3 in abscesses/@di$ cellulitis @/di$ and 2.6 in infected root canals.	1
"The recognition of the microbial origin and the specificity of @di$ periodontal infections @/di$ has resulted in the development of several adjunctive therapies (antibiotics and/or antiseptics) to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic adult periodontitis. This article aims to review the ""additional"" effect of a subgingival irrigation with chlorhexidine, or a local or systemic application of tetracycline or metronidazole, performed in combination with a single course of scaling and root planing in patients with chronic adult periodontitis. All treatment modalities are compared with scaling and root planing, based on their impact on: the probing depth (PD); total number of colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml); the proportions and/or the detection-frequency of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and @gm$ Prevotella intermedia @/gm$; and/or on the percentages of cocci, spirochetes, motile, and other micro-organisms on dark field microscopy examination."	1
The relationship between gastric @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ colonization and esophagitis was determined in 457 children undergoing endoscopic evaluation of @di$ abdominal pain and @/di$/or vomiting. In all patients, biopsies of the esophagus were examined histologically, and two antral biopsies were analyzed for the presence of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$, using standard microbiological and histochemical techniques. The incidence of biopsy-proven esophagitis was similar in @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$-positive (15/56 patients) and -negative (94/401; p = NS) groups. Clinical improvement, after 2 months of antisecretory therapy with H2-receptor antagonists, was independent of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ status (11/15 vs. 68/94 responders; p = NS). All 26 H. pylori-negative nonresponders became asymptomatic with a second course of H2-blockers. The 4/15 @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$-positive patients (all of whom had associated gastritis/duodenitis) who failed antisecretory therapy responded clinically to treatment with amoxicillin plus bismuth subsalicylate. These data indicate that primary treatment of biopsy-confirmed esophagitis in children should include anti-secretory agents, regardless of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ status. A small percentage of @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$-positive patients with esophagitis and concomitant gastroduodenal inflammation may require additional antibacterial therapy, suggesting that presence of the organism should be assessed in all pediatric patients undergoing upper endoscopic evaluation.	0
The relative abundance of @gm$ Fusobacterium @/gm$ decreased in each culture after 5 minutes of treatment; in one saliva-derived culture from an individual with halitosis, the abundance decreased by 94%. Furthermore, after 30 minutes of exposure, this genus was reduced in all tested saliva communities (Table 3). The @gm$ Fusobacterium @/gm$ genus includes the species @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$, a known producer of volatile sulfur compounds in the oral cavity and previously shown to be increased in abundance in those exhibiting oral malodor. Other taxonomic groups of interest for halitosis detected in the cultures include the genus Porphyromonas, in which we observed a decrease in abundance in three of the four cultures, and Prevotella, which decreased in the cultures derived from halitosis-associated saliva (Table 3). The genus Porphyromonas includes P. gingivalis, an important @di$ periodontal pathogen @/di$, and part of the so-called 'red complex' of oral pathogens, and a known producer of VSCs.	1
The relative abundance of @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ was found to positively correlate with several sleep parameters in prebiotic diet-fed rats, such as total sleep and REM sleep as well as total bouts of REM sleep (Figure 6). This suggests that @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ may exert a particularly important role in mediating the sleep-promoting effects of the prebiotic diet. @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ is a commensal gram-negative bacterium that has previously been shown to exert immunomodulating properties in the intestine via induction of Tregs, ameliorate metabolic dysfunction in a genetic model of obesity and in mice fed a high-fat diet, help promote quicker re-entrainment in response to circadian rhythm disruption, compensate for inadequate dietary protein intake in a mouse model of @di$ malnourishment @/di$, and contribute to resilience against metabolic, behavioral, and neurocognitive responses to chronic restraint stress.	2
The relative abundances of Porphyromonadaceae and @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ were higher in the fecal microbiota of the DSS group compared with those of the HB1628 group. Porphyromonadaceae is considered a main pathogen in IBD and is linked to intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation. The role of @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$ in IBD is unclear, but a related species within the same genus, Alistipes finegoldii, is a known trigger of intestinal inflammation. In addition, during the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IBD, patients typically suffer not only from gastrointestinal symptoms but also from some mental health problems, including depression, @di$ anxiety @/di$, and stress. A pre-clinical study that transferred the gut microbiota of colitis mice to germ-free mice induced @di$ anxiety @/di$-like and desperate behaviors, further confirming the active role of the host's gut microbiota in driving behavioral changes through intestinal inflammation.	1
The relative abundances of the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes in the @di$ CD @/di$ group decreased significantly compared to those in the control group (p < 0.01), while those of the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Deferribacteres increased significantly (p < 0.05). At the species level (top 10), the relative abundances of L. reuteri, B. choerinum, Lactobacillus prophage Lj928, Dubosiella_newyorkensis, and Exiguobacterium undae significantly reduced in the @di$ CD @/di$ group compared to those in the control group (p < 0.05), whereas the relative abundances of @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ and Bacteroides dorei significantly increased in the @di$ CD @/di$ group (p < 0.05).	1
The relative abundances of two bacterial species, @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and P. merdae, in responders were significantly lower at both baseline and 24 weeks; however, their abundances did not significantly change over time. Although the functional roles of P. merdae in chronic inflammation remain unclear, TonB-linked outer membrane protein (OmpW) produced by @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ is known to be associated with perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and the anti-OmpW immunoglobulin A levels were found to be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ is enriched in clinical @di$ gout @/di$. Therefore, the low relative abundances of @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and P.	1
The resulting list of consistent taxonomic biomarkers that are associated with @di$ RMI @/di$ included 19 bacterial species: 12 Firmicutes, 4 Bacteroides, and 3 Actinobacteria. Many major short-chain fatty acid producers, such as F. prausnitzii, @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$, R. hominis, R. bromii, and E. rectale, were included in the list. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii was identified to be a significant predictor of @di$ RMI @/di$ in all of the data sets that were included in the analysis. In addition, we found nine studies in the scientific literature that also reported the beneficial role of F. prausnitzii in immunotherapy. All of the identified consistent taxonomic biomarkers coincided with the colonizers that were identified in the FMT data sets (Fig. S3). However, only 17 out of 19 (excluding Ruminococcus bicirculans and E. siraeum) were associated with @di$ RMI @/di$ in the FMT-related data sets. Moreover, E. reclate and A. intestini were found to be predictive of @di$ RMI @/di$ only in the FMT-related data sets.	2
The results findings of two DGGE gel illustrated the more prevalence of opportunistic intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides intstinalis, Shigella dysenteriae, Parabacteroides distasonis, @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$, Bacteroides coprocola, Prevotella copri, Sporomusa ovata, Bacteroides nordii, Bacteroides helcogenes, Bacteroides paurosaccharolyticus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp) in @di$ GD @/di$ patients.	1
The results of our study show evidence of a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients with a shift of strictly anaerobic bacteria to more aerotolerant bacteria, such as Eggerthella, Coriobacteriaceae bacterium phi, R. torques, R. gnavus and @gm$ D. formicigenerans @/gm$. These potentially harmful bacteria were found to be increased in previous studies in patients with multiple sclerosis and persons who had a disrupted circadian rhythm due to night shifts. Furthermore, some pathogenic bacteria, such as the small intestine bacteria Megamonas unclassified and Dialister succinatiphilus, were more abundant in the @di$ dystonia @/di$ groups. In the DRD group, E. coli and S. wadsworthensis, both bacteria associated with gastrointestinal diseases, were more common, further suggesting a dysbiosis in @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients.	1
The results of these examinations, as well as the properties of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains isolated for the first time in the region are reported. Thirty-three out of the 55 pairs of epididymides and testicles (60%) showed gross lesions (chronic epididymitis associated with the formation of @di$ spermatocele @/di$, sperm granuloma or abscess). From the 55 pairs of epididymides and testicles examined, a total of 26 @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains were isolated: of them, 24 (92.3%) originated from breeding rams while 2 (7.7%) from ram hoggets kept together with the breeding rams. Seven out of the 26 @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains (26.9%) were cultured from the epididymides of rams which did not show palpable epididymal and/or testicular lesions. It is emphasized that chronic inflammatory processes were observed in both epididymides even if the clinically palpable epididymo-orchitis occurred unilaterally. Three out of the 26 @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains were derived from AGP-positive but ELISA-negative, while 5 from ELISA-positive but AGP-negative rams. The remaining @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains were isolated from the genital organs of rams found seropositive both by the AGP test and by ELISA. The cultural, morphological and most important biochemical properties of the 26 sub-Carpathian @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ strains were identical with those of the reference strain designated Weybridge 63/290 (@gm$ NCTC 10512 @/gm$).	1
The results revealed that @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp. and Bacteroides caccae were related to the risk of NSCLC after adjusting for sex, smoking, hypertension, @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$, COPD, and 11 core microbes (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively, Table 2). Furthermore, the AUCs derived from ROC curves were 71.4% and 66.9% for @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp. and Bacteroides caccae, respectively, using the respective values of 0.019 and 0.006 (both p < 0.001, Figure 5). The AUC did not improve when combining these two bacteria in ROC analysis (Figure 5C). However, random forest analysis showed that Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp.	0
The results revealed that @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp. and Bacteroides caccae were related to the risk of NSCLC after adjusting for sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, @di$ COPD @/di$, and 11 core microbes (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively, Table 2). Furthermore, the AUCs derived from ROC curves were 71.4% and 66.9% for @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp. and Bacteroides caccae, respectively, using the respective values of 0.019 and 0.006 (both p < 0.001, Figure 5). The AUC did not improve when combining these two bacteria in ROC analysis (Figure 5C). However, random forest analysis showed that Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$ spp.	0
The results show a negative correlation between Prevotella and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (R = -0.37, p < 0.01), and a positive correlation between @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$ and glycolithocholic acid (R = 0.32, p < 0.05) (Figure 5(c)). We analyzed the functional potential of the gut microbiome by PIRUST to investigate the functional changes of the microbial among the H-CKD, @di$ hypertension @/di$, and HC groups. Metabolism, genetic, and environmental information processing are the main functions of the human gastrointestinal microbiota. There were no differences of these main functions among the H-CKD, @di$ hypertension @/di$, and HC groups (Figure 6(a)). Using principal coordinate analysis, we found that the dominance functions of membrane transport, cell motility, signal transduction, cellular processes, and signaling in H-CKD and @di$ hypertension @/di$ groups were stronger than those in the healthy control group (Figure 6(b)). We also observed that D-glutamine (ANOVA test, p=0.014) and its metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series (Anova test, p=0.014) were significantly different between the @di$ Hypertension @/di$ and HC groups.	0
The richness and higher microbial diversity in dairy farmers support the biodiversity hypothesis that living in urban environments could mean exposure to less diverse microbial flora with increased incidences of @di$ allergic and inflammatory diseases @/di$. Peng et al. found significantly higher levels of Proteobacteria (@gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ and Acinetobacter, p < 0.05) but lower Actinobacteria (Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium, p < 0.05) on forearm skin microbiota of farmworkers.	0
The role of @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ in the pathogenesis of acne is known for decades. Numerous reports reveal that @gm$ P. acnes @/gm$ has been also associated with chronic prostatitis leading to prostate cancer, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and synovitis-pustulosis-hyperostosis and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, @di$ sarcoidosis @/di$, and sciatica.	1
The samples were analyzed by qPCR using TaqMan probes and specific primers to determine the concentrations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), @gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$ (@gm$ Pm @/gm$), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and Treponema denticola (Td). The pathobiont-based models were obtained using multivariate binary logistic regression. The best models were selected according to specified criteria. The discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and numerous classification measures were thus obtained. The nomograms were built based on the best predictive models. Eight bacterial cluster-based models showed an area under the curve (AUC) >=0.760 and a sensitivity and specificity >=75.0%. The PiTfFn cluster showed an AUC of 0.773 (sensitivity and specificity = 75.0%). When @gm$ Pm @/gm$ and AaPm were incorporated in the TdPiTfFn cluster, we detected the two best predictive models with an AUC of 0.788 and 0.789, respectively (sensitivity and specificity = 77.5%). The TdPiTfAa cluster had an AUC of 0.785 (sensitivity and specificity = 75.0%). When @gm$ Pm @/gm$ was incorporated in this cluster, a new predictive model appeared with better AUC and specificity values (0.787 and 80.0%, respectively). Distinct clusters formed by species with different etiopathogenic role (belonging to different Socransky's complexes) had a good predictive accuracy for distinguishing a site with @di$ periodontal destruction @/di$ in a periodontal patient.	1
The search for consistent taxonomic biomarkers that are associated with @di$ RMI @/di$ was carried out in two steps. At the first stage, the taxa of the gut metagenomes that set R apart from NR were identified by applying the differential rankings approach via Songbird individually for the data sets in Group 1. The top 20 taxa displaying both positive and negative differential values were selected for further analysis. The log-ratio assessment of the selected taxa across metagenomes shows a clear, statistically significant difference between the R and NR groups (Fig. S1). The concatenated Songbird-derived rankings and differentials are illustrated in Fig. 1. According to our findings, nine bacterial species (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium siraeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia wexlerae, Bacteroides ovatus, Ruminococcus bicirculans, @gm$ Barnesiella intestinihominis @/gm$, Roseburia hominis, Alistipes putredinis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Roseburia faecis) were predictors of @di$ RMI @/di$ in at least two data sets of group 1.	1
The severity of the diarrhea caused the patient to have orthostatic hypotension and @di$ acute kidney injury @/di$, which improved with fluid resuscitation. The diarrhea resolved in 24-hours, and the patient was discharged without medications. Stool studies later returned positive for @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$.	1
The shared microbiome signature in IgG4-RD and SSc raises a question about the existence of a more universal microbiome architecture in @di$ immune-mediated disorders @/di$. We observed expansions of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ and taxa typical of the oral cavity that are similar to autoimmune diseases including the neuroimmune disorder multiple sclerosis and RA, a disease with multiple joint pathologies. Comparing the differentially abundant species in IgG4-RD and SSc with those from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, we observed enrichment in four species typically overabundant in IBD (S. parasanguinis, B. producta, Lactobacillus gasseri, and R. gnavus) as well as common signals with 11 out of 42 species depleted in IBD. We observed Escherichia coli to be overabundant, albeit weakly, in SSs but not IgG4-RD. This pathobiont has been associated with mucosal inflammation and decreased gut anaerobism in IBD. Gut fibrosis in Crohn's disease leads to thickening of the intestinal wall and strictures; therefore, we searched for the HypD overabundance signal in this disease but detected no significant associations. Future integrative studies will be needed to present a coherent view of gut microbiome signals broadly implicated in @di$ immune-mediated disorders @/di$.	1
"The significantly higher prevalence of CFB935-stained oral genera in @di$ NG @/di$ compared to CG patients confirmed the understanding of @di$ NG @/di$ as a mixed microbial infection rather than a disease with abundant fusiform-spirochete bacterial flora. The probe CFB935 described as Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides assemblage contains among other species the putative periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$, P. endodontalis, and T. forsythia. In our study, about 30% of the bacteria stained with the EUB338 probe consisted of the aforementioned bacteria. The EUB338 probe detects most of the domain Bacteria except for target organisms of the phyla Planctomycetales and Verrucomicrobia. These specific bacterial species may display an ""inflammophilic"" profile and can support the occurrence and progression of @di$ NG @/di$ in the presence of a weak immune response. However, the high incidence of Bacteroidetes in @di$ NG @/di$ in contrast to CG may be attributed to the fact that the bacterial genome sequence data contain only part of the sequences of oral bacteria."	1
The so-called 'psychobiome' has been linked to a plethora of neurological and psychological diagnoses, including @di$ autism @/di$ and Parkinson's disease. Despite the ability of many bacterial species within the human intestinal microbiome to synthesize neurotransmitters, it has never been previously reported that a single bacterial species is sufficient to induce depression. Here, we demonstrate that our mouse model of Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis, the SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP1), does not exhibit baseline behavioral abnormalities. By comparison, SAMP6 mice develop depressive-like behavior that is associated with a rise in the GABA-producing bacterial genus @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$. We finally demonstrate that administration of @gm$ Parabacteroides distasonis @/gm$ into our SAMP1 mice induces depressive-like behavior. Colonization with @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ was not associated with increased intestinal inflammation or alterations in other measures of behavior. The intestinal environment of CD may be particularly conducive to colonization with @gm$ P. distasonis @/gm$ and subsequent induction of depressive-like behavior.	1
The species Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas veronii, @gm$ Aeromonas sobria @/gm$ and Aeromonas bestiarum have been described as important fish pathogens. They cause chronic disease with skin ulceration or acute systemic infection, referred to as motile aeromonad septicemia (MAS), as well as other pathological lesions. Contaminated water and food may be a source of human infections. Of the 21 species classified on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, A. hydrophila, A. caviae and A. veronii bt. sobria are the most common species known to cause human infections. They have been recognized as agents of both intestinal (gastroenteritis, child diarrhea, @di$ traveler's diarrhea @/di$, dysentery) and life-threatening extraintestinal infections (septicemia, wound infections, urinary tract infections and, occasionally, meningitidis and peritonitis), especially in immunocompromised patients and children.	1
The species enriched in the migraine group were @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$, Clostridium asparagiforme, Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium bolteae, Clostridium citroniae, Clostridium hathewayi, Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium spiroforme, Clostridium symbiosum, Eggerthella lenta, Flavonifractor plautii, Lachnospiraceae bacterium, and Ruminococcus gnavus. @gm$ B. hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ metabolizes H2/CO2 to acetate and contributes to the breakdown of plant polysaccharides and proteins in the host (Bernalier et al.,). Except for C. bolteae, an autism-associated bacterium (Pequegnat et al.,), all the other Clostridium spp. enriched in the migraine group have been reported to be correlated with solid tissue inflammation (Elsayed and Zhang,), infection (Finegold et al.,), and @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (Elsayed and Zhang,). E. lenta and F. plautii can cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (Wong et al.,) and bloodstream infection (Berger et al.,), respectively. R. gnavus, which degrades mucin (Crost et al.,), is enriched in IBD patients (Hall et al.,) and can cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$ (Hansen et al.,).	1
The species that were more abundant in patients with C-ADHD than in HCs, which included Prevotella buccae, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, were enriched and positively associated with both DSM_@di$ HD @/di$ and DSM_AD scores. Several species belonging to the genus Bacteroides that were abundant in HCs were negatively correlated with DSM_@di$ HD @/di$ and/or DSM_AD scores. We found that increased relative abundances of Bacteroides nordii, @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$ and Bacteroides intestinalis were associated with fewer symptoms of both hyperactivity/impulsivity (DSM_@di$ HD @/di$ scores) and inattention (DSM_AD scores).	2

We found that increased relative abundances of Bacteroides nordii, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Bacteroides intestinalis were associated with fewer symptoms of both hyperactivity/impulsivity (DSM_HD scores) and inattention (DSM_@di$ AD @/di$ scores). Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$ were negatively associated only with DSM_@di$ AD @/di$ scores.	2
The standard media for @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ isolation is buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (BCYE) eventually supplemented with anisomycin, dyes, polymycin and vancomycin to reduce sample contamination. Our findings support the importance of examining sputum for @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ spp. by cultural methods when @di$ pneumonia @/di$ is suspected, especially in the immunocompromized host, where early recognition of the responsible pathogen and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial for the patient's survival.	1
The strategy of engineering gut-colonizing probiotics to produce protein pharmaceuticals is under investigation for other inflammatory autoimmune diseases including @di$ diabetes @/di$, as well as for prevention of infection by rotavirus, HIV, and Vibrio cholerae. For celiac sprue, this approach would involve engineering an acid-tolerant probiotic that colonizes the stomach or upper small bowel to secrete glutenase continuously or upon introduction of dietary protein. Commercially-available probiotics such as E. coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor) and Bacillus coagulans (GanedenBC30), which are currently used as oral supplements for irritable bowel syndrome and lactose intolerance, are potential candidates for such an approach. Alternatively, prominent gut commensals such as Enterococcus faecalis, @gm$ Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron @/gm$, or Lactobacillus spp.	2
The study involved four patients with the following disorders: @di$ polycythaemia vera @/di$, pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis of the liver and arthritis of the knee. Brucellosis was diagnosed by classical serological and bacteriological methods. The strains involved could be isolated only in three of the four patients: two strains were Brucella abortus biovar 1 and one was @gm$ Brucella suis @/gm$ biovar 1.	1

The study was carried out to investigate species specter and combinational variety of bifidobacteria in children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$. The examined sampling included 73 children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$ aged from 4 to 6 years. The comparison group according common characteristic of microbiota of large intestine included 100 healthy children comparative by age. In 32 out of all examined children species specter of bifidobacteria in intestine was analyzed. The species diagnostic of bifidobacteria was implemented by using technique of polymerase chain reaction. In children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$ the analysis established dysbiosis alterations in intestinal biotope, characterizing by deficiency of bifidobacteria and selection of opportunistic microorganisms. The alteration of species structure of bifidobacteria in children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$ is demonstrated: decreasing of prevalence of populations of Bifidobacterium catenulatum and appearance of rare species of bifidobacteria B. dentium and @gm$ B. angulatum @/gm$. The differences are established concerning formation of species preference of bifidobacteria in conditions of conjoint vegetation in intestinal biotope of children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$ and in healthy children. The comprehensive analysis of micro-ecological status of intestine of children with @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$ using non-invasive techniques and including analysis of species profile, associative potential, communicative capacities of bifidobacteria complements complex of diagnostic criteria, permits to develop prognostic markers and to determine parameters of following therapy of @di$ functional dyspepsia @/di$.	1
The symptoms include @di$ fever @/di$, abdominal pain, tenderness, lower abdominal mass, nausea, vomiting, and dysuria. Ultrasonography, computerised tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging techniques may be insufficient for diagnosis. In most cases, staphylococcus species are isolated from cultures of urachal cysts. Other microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, @gm$ Enterococcus faecium @/gm$, Klebsiella pneumonia, and rarely actinomyces may be isolated.	1
The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease from most to least common include fever, cough, chills, dyspnea, neurological abnormalities, @di$ myalgia @/di$ or arthralgia, diarrhea, chest pain, headache, and nausea or vomiting. Non-specific laboratory findings are common, such as elevated CK level, myoglobinuria, hyponatremia, microscopic hematuria, and leukocytosis. The rate of hyponatremia was 25.3% in a study of CAP. In Legionnaires' disease, the rate of hyponatremia was 44.4%. Hyponatremia has a negative impact on multiple outcomes, such as the need for mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the duration of hospital or ICU stay. In particular, hyponatremia adds more than 10,000 RMB to the cost of care. In studies of @gm$ Legionella @/gm$-related CAP, hyponatremia (< 133 mmol/L) was one of the strongest predictors. Our patient had hyponatremia, elevated CK level, myoglobinuria, and leukocytosis, which were important reasons that the attending physician suspected @gm$ Legionella @/gm$-related CAP and administered moxifloxacin.	1
"The symptoms of canine brucellosis are similar to the symptoms of brucellosis caused by other Brucella species and endocarditis or @di$ meningitis @/di$ may develop in untreated cases. There is limited data regarding B.canis infections in man and the current status of the disease is insufficiently evaluated in our country. Serological diagnosis of brucellosis is classically based on standard slide and tube agglutination tests. However, the antigens used in these tests detect antibodies that develop against species (B.melitensis, B.abortus, @gm$ B.suis @/gm$) with ""smooth"" lipopolysaccharides in their cell wall."	0
The term haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) was first used in the 1950s to describe the combination of clinical presentations of haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and @di$ renal failure @/di$. Outbreaks of HUS led clinicians to suspect an infectious cause, and in 1985 Karmali et al. showed that Shiga toxin-producing   @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$   (STEC) could be isolated from the faecal specimens of a sub-set of HUS patients reporting a diarrhoeal prodrome.	1
The term hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) refers to a heterogenous group of disorders arising from an initial endothelial cell injury with fibrin and platelet thrombi formation in the vasculature, leading to severe @di$ organ damage @/di$ resulting in the well-known triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and kidney disease. The majority of pediatric cases (90 percent) of HUS are caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS) or @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ and rarely with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal-HUS).	1
The test bacteria used in this study include 4 Gram-positive bacteria [@gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)], 6 Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 2 yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida utilis). The microbial strains were previously isolated from @di$ diabetic @/di$ patients in Hospital Seberang Jaya, Penang, with a cohort of chronic wounds.	1
The transition from a state of subacute @di$ acidosis @/di$ (SARA) to acute @di$ acidosis @/di$ is due in large part to the accumulation of lactate in the rumen, which is a consequence of the inability of lactate utilizers to compensate for the increased production of lactate. In this report, we present the 16S rRNA gene-based identification of two bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Bt-01708_Bf (89.0% identical to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) and Bt-01899_Ap (95.3% identical to @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$), that were enriched from rumen fluid cultures in which only lactate was provided as an exogenous substrate.	2
The two largest cohort studies on male carriage of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ conducted until present - both involving male attendees of a sexually transmitted disease clinic - documented male urethral carriage of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ at a rate of 11.4% (49/430) in the UK and of 4.5% (10/309) in Sweden. As a matter of fact, male carriage of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ may even be higher than estimated from the aforementioned studies, as urethral sampling may not be the optimal approach to document it. Kinghorn et al found a significantly higher rate of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ isolation from preputial than from urethral swabs. Swidsinski et al recently made a similar observation, and found that desquamated epithelial cells loaded with @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ could only reliably be recovered in a urine specimen if the praeputium was not pulled back during voiding. In this manner, it was shown that among 100 men admitted to a department of internal medicine, dispersed @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$ occurred in 4% of males, while cohesive @gm$ Gardnerella @/gm$ was present in 7%. In addition, several culture-based studies have also documented the presence of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ in semen samples - possibly pointing at a seminal or prostatic reservoir - whereby in one study @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ was recovered from semen in as much as 38% of 58 men attending an infertility clinic. Intriguingly, preceding the renowned description of @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ as the causative agent in non-specific vaginitis by Gardner and Dukes, the very first description of the species now known as @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ was in association with @di$ prostatitis @/di$.	1
The two main pathogenic species are Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the agent of a major pig disease called swine dysentery, and @gm$ Brachyspira pilosicoli @/gm$, the cause of a condition known as intestinal (or colonic) spirochetosis. @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ has a wider host range than B. hyodysenteriae, and colonizes a variety of species, including human beings. Infections with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ are particularly common in intensively housed pigs and chickens: colonized individuals may develop focal areas of inflammation in the large intestine, with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and reduced rates of growth and production. Colonization with @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ also occurs at a high prevalence rate in human beings living in crowded and unhygienic conditions, particularly in developing countries, as well as amongst homosexual males. Despite the potential importance of @gm$ B. pilosicoli @/gm$ as a pathogen, it has not been extensively studied.	1
The type of nerve @di$ involvement @/di$ in the case of M. avium differs from M. leprae in being predominantly an axonal degeneration at the 8th post-inoculation month, that is, degeneration of the complete axon and myelin debris remnants; whereas in M. leprae infection, where segmental demyelination predominates, the axons are intact and it is the Schwann cell that is affected. The neural changes in the case of FMR isolates No. 51 and No. 75 were similar to those seen in mice inoculated with M. leprae obtained directly from human biopsies. Other mycobacteria, HI-75 (Skinsnes) and @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$, showed growth in the foot pad initially which persisted in the case of @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ until the 20th post-inoculation month, but no ultrastructural changes were observed in the sciatic nerves of these mice.	0
The vaginal microbiota is a complex ecosystem consisting of around 200 species of microorganisms, being @gm$ Lactobacillus crispatus @/gm$, L. jensenii and L. gasseri the most represented species. Several studies have shown that around 70% of the vaginal microbiota in pregnant and non-pregnant women is composed of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$. The substitution of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ by pathogenic or opportunistic microorganisms is associated with the development of bacterial vaginosis and lower @di$ urinary tract infections @/di$, and the presence of non-@gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ species has been associated with poor reproductive health and/or complications in pregnancy.	1
The water content of feces and the small intestinal transit rate were significantly greater in the low-dose @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 669 group than those in the low-dose @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667 group, and the time to the first black stool defecation was similar to that in the @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667 group. These results revealed that @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667 relieves @di$ constipation @/di$ by improving the colonic transit time and that @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 669 relieves @di$ constipation @/di$ by promoting small intestinal peristalsis. Furthermore, @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667 did not have adhesion ability, so it passed into the large intestine with chyme. It would quickly produce SCFAs from carbohydrates that could not be absorbed by the small intestine and would stimulate colon peristalsis, ultimately accelerating colonic transit time. The action of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 669 was completely contrary to that of @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667. It partly colonized in the small intestine, promoted intestinal peristalsis and improved the small intestinal transit rate. The remainder passed into the large intestine with chyme and played the same role as @gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$ CCFM 667.	2
The wrinkly spreader morph of @gm$ Pseudomonas fluorescens @/gm$ arises repeatedly during experimental evolution. The mutational causes reside exclusively within three pathways. By eliminating these, 13 new mutational pathways were discovered with the newly arising @di$ WS @/di$ types having fitnesses similar to those arising from the commonly passaged routes.	0
Their sera were tested for antibodies to the Pseudomonas fluorescens-associated sequence I2, a @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ TonB-linked outer membrane protein, OmpW, and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA). Simultaneously, samples for fecal calprotectin measurements were obtained from 55 subjects. RESULTS: IBD was diagnosed in 60 patients (Crohn's disease [CD] in 18 patients, ulcerative colitis [UC] in 36, and @di$ indeterminate colitis @/di$ [IC] in 6).	0
There are 2501 serotypes of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ identified up to 2004. World health organization estimated that typhoid fever accounts for 21.7 million illnesses and paratyphoid fever accounts for 5.4 million cases each year. Enteric fever is caused by the serotypes Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), Salmonella Paratyphi A (S.Para A), Salmonella Paratyphi B (S Para B) and @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi C @/gm$ (@gm$ S.Para C @/gm$). Enteric fever includes typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Enteric fever is endemic in India and S.Typhi and S.Para A being the commonest. S.Para B and @di$ S.Para C infections @/di$ are rare in India. Apart from India, S.Para A is prevalent in other Asian countries, Eastern Europe and South America. S.Para B is prevalent in Western Europe, North America, Britain and @gm$ S.Para C @/gm$ in Eastern Europe and Guyana.	1
There are four Shigella species that cause shigellosis: @gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ is considered to be the most virulent species, particularly @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1 serotype due to its ability to produce a potent cytotoxin called Shiga toxin (STX). S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei generally do not produce Shiga toxin and, therefore, cause mild forms of shigellosis. Shiga toxins can also be produced by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Two types of STX are known in STEC: STX 1 which differs by a single amino acid from STX in @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ type 1, and STX 2 which shares only about 55% amino acid similarity with STX 1. STX operons for both type 1 and 2 STX consist of the stxA and stxB subunit genes, which encode the AB5 holotoxin. Rarely, Shiga toxin stx genes can be transferred to non-STX-producing S. flexneri and S. sonnei by means of a lambdoid bacteriophage either from STEC or @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$, providing those strains with the ability to cause more severe disease. Infections caused by bacterial species that produce STX often lead to @di$ hemorrhagic colitis @/di$ and may cause serious complications, like hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The epidemiology of different Shigella species also varies. S. flexneri is most common in developing countries, while S. sonnei is most common in developed countries. @gm$ S. dysenteriae @/gm$ is least common in the developed countries; however, it is often a cause of outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.	1
There are many causes for thoracic aortic aneurysms, including atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or @di$ Marfan syndrome @/di$), cystic medial necrosis, Takayasu's arteritis, family history/genetic factors, and infection by @gm$ Treponema pallidum @/gm$ (syphilitic aortitis).	1
There are six distinct clinical features which have been noted: leukomoid reaction, refractory hypotension, severe tachycardia, profound capillary leak syndrome, hemoconcentration, and lack of @di$ fever @/di$ marking the C. sordelli toxic shock syndrome. The leukomoid reaction is characteristic of the @gm$ clostridium @/gm$ species with similar reaction seen with clostridium difficile.	1
There has been a substantial rise in the incidence and occurrence of aggressive methicillin-resistant @gm$ Staphylococcus aureus @/gm$ (MRSA) and its drug resistance over the past centuries. These MRSA are opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which are widely distributed in the healthcare industry and the community settings as nosocomial pathogens. These opportunistic MRSA can lead to infection from the skin to life-threatening pneumonia as well as bacteraemia, @di$ endocarditis @/di$, diseases in the skin and smooth tissue, bone, and articulate diseases. The ongoing increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance has intensified patient situations by extending the hospitalization stay duration, raising the entire overall cost of treatment and rising deaths. The amount of life-threatening bacteria is increasing each year, although @gm$ Staphylococcus @/gm$ continues to be the world's leading source of infectious diseases worldwide.	1
There is a need for more approaches to aid in @di$ weight loss @/di$ or to control obesity. Supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum in obese mice reduced the deposition of adipose and upregulated the expression of lipid oxidative genes compared to control mice. In order to treat obesity, Lactobacillus species can be used in combination with dietary management. L. sakei was found to impose anti-obesity effects when used in obese murine models. The synbiotic supplements contained @gm$ L. acidophilus @/gm$, Bifidobacterium lactis, B.	2
There is growing evidence that the gut microbiome plays an important role in @di$ cancer @/di$ treatment. According to experimental studies several bacteria are involved in CRC carcinogenesis, including Fusobacterium nucleatum and certain strains of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. The gut microbiota interacts with host cells to regulate many physiological processes, such as metabolism and immune response. The gut microbiome was initially found to modulate the response to immune checkpoint blockade in mouse models. Mice with different microbes had significant differences in response to treatment. Many of these findings have been verified in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ICI. Several studies demonstrate the significant association between commensal microbial composition and clinical response to anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy. Specific bacteria are positively correlated with immunotherapeutic response, including Akkermansia muciniphila, @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$, B. fragilis, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium limosum, Faecalibacterium spp and Alistipes shahii. Analysis of the gut microbiota and of the immunological profiling in the @di$ tumor @/di$ microenvironment shows that the expression of cytotoxic T cell markers and antigen processing and presentation are augmented in patients with favorable gut microbiota compared with patients with unfavorable gut microbiota. Another study has identified a consortium of 11 bacterial strains that could enhance the action of ICI to inhibit @di$ tumor @/di$ growth in a subcutaneous @di$ tumor @/di$ model derived from a mouse colon adenocarcinoma cell line.	2
There was a significant maternal history of @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ associated with the ingestion of oysters 2 weeks prior to delivery. RESULT: The endophthalmitis was treated with parenteral antibiotics and topical mydriatics with complete resolution, although subsequent assessment of the affected eye suggests a poor visual outcome. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis in the newborn is an unusual clinical finding and usually presents with other manifestations of bacteraemia. @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ is fortunately an infrequent cause of neonatal infection, but is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. We postulate that this neonate acquired @gm$ P. shigelloides @/gm$ via the transplacental route, and suggest that this organism be included in the list of 'other' causes of transplacental infection that has been abbreviated to 'O' in the acronym 'TORCH'.	1
There was a total of 48 samples from mothers admitted to the hospital due to an elevated risk of @di$ premature birth @/di$. An equal number of control samples was randomly selected from mothers admitted under the standard procedure for spontaneous labor (Supplemental Table S4). We trained the RFC model on a subset of 133 species variables that were present in at least 25% of samples and which also had a minimum of 50 mean normalized reads across all samples. A preliminary round of training resulted in a classifier that incorporated the frequencies of 109 species variables. The species feature with the highest importance in the 109-species model was @gm$ Mageeibacillus indolicus @/gm$, a recently isolated bacterium from the female genital tract. Recursive factor removal (RFR) was performed whereby the classifier was refined by eliminating the least important species variable from the data set and retraining with the remaining taxa. This process was run iteratively, testing the accuracy of the resulting classifier at each round. Local regression (LOWESS) applied to a scatterplot of model accuracy indicated that a maximal accuracy was achieved with twelve species variables (Supplemental Table S4). These twelve species were then used to train the definitive classifier. The overall accuracy of the RFC in distinguishing admission for full-term spontaneous births from samples admitted for a risk of @di$ premature birth @/di$ increased from 62.5% percent for the preliminary model with 109 variables to 83.3% with the optimized twelve species.	1
There were 31 genera common to all the three types of @di$ diabetes @/di$. Figure 5c and Supplementary Table 5 represents the abundances and intergroup differences of the top 25 genera. The core bacterial genera in the healthy control cohort included Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Clostridium, @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Parabacteroides, Dialister, Blautia, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio, and Acetivibrio. While, Alistipes was found uniquely in patients with Type 1 diabetes, both Type 1 and 2 group contained a core of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Megasphaera, Bifidobacterium, and unclassified Clostridiales. Patients with @di$ Type3c diabetes @/di$ had a distinctive pattern of fecal bacteriome, containing Nesterenkonia, Geobacter, Acinetobacter, Porphyromonas and Arthrobacter as the unique core.	0
There were two mortality cases due to septic shock; one of them was a 61-year-old woman in whom @gm$ Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus @/gm$ was isolated and who died at 4 weeks of treatment. The other patient was a 79-year-old man with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia who died after 6 months of treatment. S. aureus is known to be the most common microorganism associated with any type of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$. MRSA has risen as an important pathogen also in community-acquired @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$.	1
Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic properties of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ in treating MAFLD in an obese mice model induced by high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diets, which well mimics the humans daily diet and is critical for inducing hepatocyte injury and driving the development of @di$ fatty liver-associated disease @/di$. Our second aim was to investigate the molecular mode of action of @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ by identifying the significant metabolites correlated with MAFLD treatment. This was carried out by performing hepatic metabolomics analysis of the liver samples from @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$-treated mice, in terms of the important pathological pathways leading to MAFLD and by relevant intervention studies in cell models. Our data revealed that mice treated with @gm$ A. muciniphila @/gm$ efficiently increased lipid oxidation and bile acid metabolism, thus maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier and reshaping the gut microbiota composition.	2
Therefore, this study assessed gut microbiome composition and its related functional capacity to metabolize fruit (poly)phenols in individuals with prediabetes and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ (PreDM-IR, n = 26) compared to a metabolically healthy Reference group (n = 10). METHODS: Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize gut microbiome composition. Targeted quantitative metabolomic analyses of plasma and urine collected over 24 h were used to assess microbial-derived metabolites in response to a (poly)phenol-rich raspberry test drink. RESULTS: PreDM-IR compared to the Reference group: (1) enriched Blautia obeum and Blautia wexlerae and depleted Bacteroides dorei and @gm$ Coprococcus eutactus @/gm$.	0
Thermophilic Campylobacter, especially Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$, are considered the most common bacterial agent of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. Directive 2003/99/EC (European Commission,) establishes the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agent such as Campylobacter spp. This approach shall include each production step in the food chain: from farm level to the retail sale. Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ are distributed in the intestinal tract of many asymptomatic birds and mammals that are considered the main reservoirs for these microrganisms. Transmission to humans mainly occurs through consumption or handling of animal origin foods; moreover, contact with infected animals may determine human campylobacteriosis (OIE,). The disease is usually characterised by acute gastrointestinal signs represented by diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, @di$ vomiting @/di$, fever and headache.	1
These SCFAs play an important role in several processes, especially lipid metabolism, resulting in human @di$ weight loss @/di$. From our preliminary study on the production of acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid, acetic acid was the only short-chain fatty acid detected, regardless of the strain used and incubation time (data not shown). The production of acetic acid from B. bifidum, @gm$ B. breve @/gm$, and L. acidophilus after incubation for 1, 3, and 5 days at 37  C was then evaluated as shown in Fig. 1. After 5 days of incubation, B. bifidum and L. acidophilus showed significant increase of acetic acid production (P < 0.05), while there was no difference, comparing between those observed from day 1 and day 3 (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the similar acetic acid production was found from @gm$ B. breve @/gm$ for every incubation time tested (P > 0.05).	2
"These are the first cases to be reported with @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ mimicking cholera in our area. CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients were admitted at the isolation unit designated by the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre for emerging infectious diseases and provided informed consent about regular stool analysis and culture under the provisional diagnosis of gastroenteritis. The first patient was a 23-year-old black African woman with a 2-day history of watery diarrhea and @di$ vomiting @/di$ associated with a temperature of 39.7  C. The second patient was a 47-year-old black African woman with a 2-day history of diarrhea and @di$ vomiting @/di$ with a temperature of 37.7  C, and she was hemodynamically stable. Both patients were isolated in a specific area for infection control and treated with fluids and orally administered rehydration solution, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and paracetamol. Stool culture was done. The isolated colonies were reported as V. cholerae and transferred to the research laboratory of Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute for confirmation using whole genome sequencing. Microbiological testing determined colonies isolated from stool to be V. cholerae, and warranted the conclusion ""presumptive cholera."" Whole genome sequencing, however, established the presence of @gm$ Aeromonas caviae @/gm$ rather than V."	1
These drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, phototoxic dermatitis, and vestibular damage, and fatal reactions due to hepatotoxicity have occurred in pregnant women. Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of bacteriostatic activity, but its association with suppression of the bone marrow and aplastic anemia has relegated it to a historical role. Erythromycin is the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by M. pneumoniae, Legionella species, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and @gm$ Streptococcus pneumoniae @/gm$. The frequency of serious adverse effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; dose-related epigastric distress may occur. Clindamycin is bactericidal to most nonenterococcal gram-positive aerobic bacteria and many anaerobic microorganisms. Although historically it was a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and colitis, clindamycin is considered an excellent alternative to beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of many staphylococcal infections, and it has therapeutic utility in anaerobic infections and in several protozoan infections in immunosuppressed patients. Metronidazole is efficacious for treating nonpulmonary anaerobic infections, various parasitic infections (trichomoniasis, amebiasis, and giardiasis), nonspecific vaginitis, and Clostridium difficile-mediated colitis. With use of metronidazole, mild side effects such as epigastric discomfort, @di$ diarrhea @/di$, reversible neutropenia, and allergic-type cutaneous reactions may occur.	1
These features included abdominal pain (30%), @di$ vomiting @/di$ (24.5%), fever (31.5%), dehydration (9.5%) and hematochezia (19.5%). Aeromonas spp. were more frequently isolated from patients with gastroenteritis (2.5%) than from control patients (1.0%) (P less than 0.05). Isolates were recovered more often during the dry months (66.7%), than during the wet months (33.3%). Among the enteric pathogens isolated, Aeromonas spp. (2.5%) ranked next to Esch. coli (14.5%) and Shigella spp. (6.3%) in prevalence. Other bacterial isolates included @gm$ Plesiomonas shigelloides @/gm$ (1.5%) Vibrio spp.	1
These genera were represented by Acinetobacter genomospecies 3, @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas amygdali; these species have been isolated from hospital environments and they have been associated with antibiotic resistance. In horses, Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus have been isolated from a venous catheter-associated with @di$ thrombophlebitis @/di$.	1
These glycolipids have been mainly studied in Mycobacterium leprae (triglycosylated PGL-I) and @gm$ Mycobacterium marinum @/gm$ (monoglycosylated PGL), being used for diagnostic testing in leprosy patients. The exact structure of PGL is species-specific, and its biological properties are starting to be elucidated. In this regard, while in leprosy, M. leprae PGL-1 subverts tissue macrophages to produce @di$ neurotoxic @/di$ radical nitrogen species (e.g., nitric oxide) leading to nerve damage. Along this line, PGL-1 has also been shown to be effective oxygen radicals scavengers. In M. marinum infection, PGL drives phagosome maturation arrest, and allows the bacterium to escape from hostile tissue-resident macrophages during the initial stages of the infection. By doing so, @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ uses PGL to infect resident macrophages and induce the secretion of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) attracting non-bactericidal monocytes, which will be subsequently infected by @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ and used as Trojan horses to cause a systemic infection.	1
These polyphenolic compounds are well known for their antioxidative abilities, are antimicrobial phytoalexins responsible for flower pigmentation to attract pollinators and, in addition to other properties, are also specific bacterial regulators governing the expression of Rhizobium genes involved in root @di$ nodulation @/di$ (Firmin et al., 1986). The bacterial chalcone isomerase (CHI) from @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$ catalyses the first step in a flavanone-degradation pathway by ring opening of (2S)-naringenin to form naringenin chalcone.	0
These results likely indicate that caspase-1 was not involved in cell death and support the previous report that macrophages derived from caspase-1 knockout mice also showed NLRP3/ASC-dependent cell death and exacerbated the @di$ inflammatory @/di$ response induced by @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$.	1
These two common bacterial dysbiotic states are known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) and @di$ aerobic vaginitis @/di$ (@di$ AV @/di$) and both of them can be identified through microscopy. BV is a common dysbiosis characterized by reduced or no lactobacilli with the strict anaerobes mentioned above in dominance. In contrast, @di$ AV @/di$ is a condition characterized by reduced lactobacilli and overgrowth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp. (including group B streptococci), @gm$ Enterococcus faecalis @/gm$, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and/or coagulase-negative Staphylococci spp.. BV and @di$ AV @/di$ are distinct with a significant difference in the inflammatory response, with @di$ AV @/di$ presenting a classical inflammatory response, whereas BV can be more or less silent/sub-clinical.	1
They are currently classified into six major groups, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus bovis/equinus, @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis groups, and can be responsible for a wide range of diseases. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus are commonly associated with dental caries and odontogenic infections. Besides, NBHS are a frequent cause of bacteremia in immunocompromised patients resulting from underlying malignancy or cancer therapy, ranging from the first to the fifth cause of bloodstream infections in neutropenic patients with @di$ hematological malignancies @/di$ and solid tumors, and accounting for 8% to 26% of the cases. NBHS, mainly of the S. bovis/equinus, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$, S.	1
They emphasized the ease of isolation of phages against such pathogenic strains as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, extended spectra beta-lactamase E. coli, and K. pneumonia, but greater difficulty to find phages active against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Isolation of phages that are active against S. aureus turned out to be the most difficult. However, e.g., and obtained phages active against S. aureus clinical @di$ MRSA @/di$ strains.	0
They fabricated a sensor surface containing the @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ strain. The cellular damage associated to the phenol presence induced a change of SPR signal. The detection limit of phenol was 5 ppm. Ascorbic acid is a commonly available nutrient which has anti-oxidizing properties. It is largely used in the industrial food processing as a preservative. Excess of ascorbic acid in food produces @di$ gastric problems @/di$.	0
This M1-M2 imbalance limits energy expenditure capacity and promotes @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ in mice. Furthermore, IRE1alpha knockdown reduces M1 proinflammatory macrophages and promotes the M2-pheynotypic shift in macrophages in a mouse model of steatosis, aggravating the ischemia reperfusion injury of fatty liver. Accordingly, we demonstrated here that IRE1alpha inhibition reduces M1 macrophage polarization in @gm$ Brucella @/gm$-infected macrophages without affecting M2 macrophages, corroborating the UPR role as an important inflammatory signal during bacterial infections.	1
This analysis confirmed @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ as the dominant bacterium in individuals with @di$ DS @/di$, with a relative abundance of 35.04%, while Bacteroides was the dominant bacteria in non-@di$ DS @/di$ volunteers, with a relative abundance of 29.56%. Both @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and Bacteroides belong to Bacteroidetes (plylum), Bacteroidia (class), and Bacteroides (order). Bacteroides can be further divided into Prevotellaceae (family), @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ (genus) and Bacteroidaceae (family), Bacteroides (genus). This suggests that that the intestines of individuals with @di$ DS @/di$ may provide a preferred environment for @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ rather than Bacteroides, and that the relative level of order Bacteroides bacteria may be a key marker of @di$ DS @/di$ linked to severity.	1
This article provides a review of such studies, particularly in relation to @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$, Chlamydia pneumoniae, dental disease and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as references to possible mechanisms. The association between coronary heart disease and @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ or between heart disease and dental disease may be accounted for by residual confounding. Although markers of C. pneumoniae infection are around twenty times more common in atherosclerotic plaques than in disease-free blood vessels, the sequence of infection and disease is uncertain. For CMV, a limited number of patients with classic @di$ atherosclerotic @/di$ coronary heart disease have been investigated in seroepidemiological studies.	1
"This association between @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and T2DM is important as the levels of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in the vagina are reported to be associated with menopausal status, and in the bladder with reduced risk of post-operative UTI. Most lactobacilli are considered to be beneficial, but some are associated with urinary disorders. For example, one species of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ (L. gasseri) is reported to be associated with @di$ urgency urinary incontinence @/di$, while another (@gm$ L. crispatus @/gm$) is associated with the lack of LUTS. Because the ages of our two cohorts are comparable, the measured difference should not be attributed to hormone level changes in the bladder and vaginal microbiota. Yet, the reason for the association between @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and T2DM remains unclear, however, body weight appears to be an important factor. It has been reported that @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ is resistant to widely used antibiotics and ""may multiply during treatment giving the genus an advantage over antibiotic sensitive commensals and allowing it to invade the urinary system"" (, p. 10). It is also reported to cause microbial dysbiosis in the bladder. Persons with T2DM often have multiple infections (e.g., sinus, urinary, skin), requiring the use of antibiotics. Thus, whether previous antibiotic use is a reason for the increased presence of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ in T2DM is worthy of exploration, particularly since its increased relative abundance in T2DM is a new finding compared to women without T2DM of similar characteristics."	1
This case demonstrates an advanced presentation of HIV infection, with initial presentation primarily due to the development of spontaneous @di$ pneumothorax @/di$ in the setting of COVID-19 infection. CT imaging of the chest was the first evidence that demonstrated a marked discrepancy in the clinical presentation and his advanced disease progression. These imaging findings led to a series of diagnostic studies that revealed an end-stage HIV-AIDS diagnosis with superimposed COVID-19, @gm$ M kansasii @/gm$, PJP pneumonia, CMV, and Candida infection. After rapid deterioration and the development of additional pneumothoraces, he began to respond to treatment. This case highlights the numerous risk factors for spontaneous @di$ pneumothorax @/di$ in HIV patients and underscores the importance of imaging studies in their management.	1
This chronic low-grade inflammation sensitizes the neurons involved in detecting @di$ pain @/di$, transmitting @di$ pain @/di$ signals and representing @di$ pain @/di$ in the CNS, making them more excitable and sensitive. Ultimately, FM is a condition of altered CNS nociceptive processing, altered peripheral nociception and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis and, particularly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) due to the colonization of the distal small bowel with colonic bacteria, has been associated with FM. Species including F. prausnitzii, B. uniformis, P. copri and Blautia faecis. F. prausnitzii are butyrate-producing microbes decreased in intestinal disease states and in FM patients as evident by the presence of circulating SCFA. F. prausnitzii is believed to have anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects and to improve barrier function. Importantly, in FM patients, an abundance of butyrate producers (I. butyriciproducens, F. plautii, B. desmolans, E. tayi, @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ and E. massiliensis) has been detected. Several studies assessing the role of dysbiosis in @di$ FM pain @/di$ describe leaky gut, LPS toxin, SCFAs and activation of the intestinal immune system promoting systemic inflammation in patients.	2
This highly contagious disease is characterized by the sudden onset of clinical symptoms, including @di$ dyspnea @/di$, hemorrhagic tracheal discharge, and bronchial obstruction. Subsequently, six strains of @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ (@gm$ ORT @/gm$) and three strains of Streptococcus zooepidemicus were isolated from the various organs and identified using biochemical tests and PCR methods. The pathogenesis of embolization in chickens is poorly understood. The current experimental study confirmed that ORT infection alone could induce a significantly fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia and high mortality in comparison with S. zooepidemicus infection. Moreover, co-infection of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ with S. zooepidemicus could induce even higher mortality, with severe bronchial obstruction, than that observed in chickens infected with S. zooepidemicus or @gm$ ORT @/gm$ alone. Therefore, the combination of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ and S. zooepidemicus may be associated with the outbreak of chicken bronchial embolization. Further investigation of the pathogenesis of @gm$ ORT @/gm$ and Streptococcus is urgently needed.	1
This is a forthcoming report, for assessing the value of Xpert @gm$ MTB @/gm$/RIF assay in participants with smear-negative UTB. This study carried out in Henan provincial chest hospital from January 2018 to July 2022 in China. Participants in this study were aged 15 to 86 years with clinical or radiological features suggestive of UTB, such as participants with severe storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), @di$ hematuria @/di$, sterile pyuria, genital TB disorders, or participants with newly diagnosed TB at other sites where UTB was suspected. 19 participants who were HIV positive or had recently gotten anti-TB therapy for over one month or had recently gotten anti-TB therapy for over one month or had a background marked by a medical procedure to eliminate kidneys obliterated by TB were prohibited. Participants in this study were asked to provide urine samples for examination, including smear, culture, Xpert @gm$ MTB @/gm$/RIF, and TB-DNA testing. Given that M. tb culture is not ideal for the detection of EPTB, the Comprehensive Reference Standard (CRS) was also used as a reference standard in this study in the absence of a perfect gold standard, as recommended by relevant scholars.. In brief, this study divided the participants into two groups according to CRS: the UTB group and the Not-UTB group. The UTB group can include three more, i.e., the probable UTB group is participants with positive imaging, i.e., with a positive cystoscopy biopsy, or positive radiology; the probable UTB group is participants who influence anti-TB therapy; and the plausible UTB group is participants with clinical symptoms consistent with UTB. Not-UTB were participants without the above indicators and those who improved without anti-TB treatment. Participants were tested for smear, culture, Xpert @gm$ MTB @/gm$/RIF, and TB-DNA and the results were analyzed.	1
This is because the smooth surface of mirror aluminium reflects much more infrared light than @di$ STS @/di$, leading to much lower absorption, which can be evidenced by much lower absorption of pixel spectra collected from empty mirror aluminium (Figure S8) compared to @di$ STS @/di$ (Figure S5). It is also found that spectra of @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ show strong atmospheric interferences, leading to poor spectral quality. Spectral profiles in the 3500-2500 cm-1 range, originating from O-H, N-H and C-H stretching are comparable to those obtained using the stainless steel substrate. Pixel spectra were extracted and displayed in Figure S9 to visualize the spectral profiles. As seen, serious atmospheric interferences are dominating the spectra when the concentration goes lower than 1 OD, again suggesting the deteriorate spectral quality compared to that from stainless steel. No pixels can be recognized as bacteria when the concentration is reduced to 0.01 OD. Therefore, similar to @di$ STS @/di$, samples with concentrations lower than 0.1 OD are not considered for further analysis.	0
This is especially beneficial for comparing trends of adhesion of different species and strains and/or with the use of @gm$ S. carnosus @/gm$ as a model surrogate organism. This method has the potential to be used in studies with disease-state skin corneocytes (such as those from @di$ AD @/di$ skin), nasal corneocytes, and animal corneocytes and with other fluorescently labeled microorganisms.	0
This is in agreement with a prior report demonstrating that viral clearance from the submandibular glands is unaltered in CD94-deficient DBA/2J mice (which share the BALB/c Ly49 genes) compared to DBA/2J mice expressing a CD94 transgene, despite increased expression of Qa-1 in the submandibular glands after @di$ viral infection @/di$. The 129/SvJ allele of Ly49I expressed in CD94-deficient and CD94Tg/- mice binds the MCMV m157 glycoprotein and might prevent NK cell responses to MCMV-infected cells. Lack of CD94 did not enhance control of MCMV. Thus, despite potentially playing an important role in the NK cell response to HCMV, in mice CD94-NKG2 receptors do not appear to be essential for the NK cell response to MCMV in the mouse strains tested, possibly due to redundancies in the NK response to MCMV. This may be due to different ligands for CD94-NKG2C induced by HCMV or different peptides being presented by HLA-E during infection that alter CD94-NKG2C activity. Additionally CD94-deficienct mice did not alter resistance to LCMV, vaccinia virus, or @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, but might be important for control of other pathogens. For example, CD94-NKG2A expression on @di$ polyoma virus @/di$-specific CD8+ T cells limits their cytolytic capacity when engaging Qa-1-expressing target cells.	0
This is, to our knowledge, the first case of brain abscesses due to @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$ complicated by ventriculitis and @di$ obstructive hydrocephalus @/di$ requiring VPS placement. While 12 cases of adults with fusobacterial brain abscesses have been reported in the literature, only 1 case presented with ventriculitis, without @di$ hydrocephalus @/di$, and with a complete response to antibiotic therapy alone. In our case, the development of ventriculitis with @di$ obstructive hydrocephalus @/di$ is likely related to the leakage of adjacent cerebral abscesses into the ventricles.	1
This model confirmed enrichment of Staphylococcus aureus in the acute AAV cases (VIP 2.0) compared with the controls, as well as several @di$ caries @/di$-associated species with a VIP-value > 1.2 (7 species in Lactobacillus, Streptococcus mutans, Scardovia wiggsiae, 2 species in @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Prevotella denticola and Veillonellaceae [G-1]).	1
This model of bacteria-host interaction in CRC has helped pave the way to new therapeutic strategies such as supplementation of microbial fermentation products such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects; direct suppression of bacterial toxin-induced DNA damage and @di$ tumorigenesis @/di$ using small inhibitor molecules; use of prebiotics shown to decrease carcinogen-induced aberrant crypt foci number in vivo; consumption of lactic acid bacteria-containing probiotics, which can prevent DNA damage induced by the mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines; and the use of bacteria such as @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ and Bacteroides to enhance anti-tumor immune therapy efficiency and therefore improving tumor control.	2
This study aimed to investigate the effects of heat-killed Bifidobacterium bifidum B1628 (HB1628) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice. The following three mouse groups were included (n = eight per group): NC (normal control), DSS (@di$ colitis @/di$), and HB1628 (@di$ colitis @/di$ and postbiotic). The mice in the DSS group showed significant weight loss and histological damage, developed bloody diarrhea, scored high in the disease activity index (DAI), and exhibited increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) and decreases in an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) in the serum. These changes were accompanied by gut microbiota modulation in @di$ colitis @/di$ mice (decreases in Rikenellaceae and Eubacterium; increases in Peptostreptococcaceae, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Parasutterella excrementihominis). The HB1628 group had lower DAIs, histology scores, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), but higher levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13), compared with the DSS group, suggesting a less severe inflammatory state after the HB1628 intervention. Additionally, HB1628 improved DSS-induced gut dysbiosis, which is evidenced by increases in intestinal beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, and decreases in known unfavorable taxa in IBD, e.g., Porphyromonadaceae, Subdoligranulum, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3_1_46FAA, and @gm$ Alistipes indistinctus @/gm$. Functional metagenomics revealed three significantly enriched metabolic pathways in the HB1628 group (namely, the aerobic respiration I [cytochrome c] pathway and the superpathways of L-phenylalanine biosynthesis and L-tryptophan biosynthesis, respectively). In conclusion, our results showed that HB1628 effectively improved the inflammation state and tissue damage in DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mice, and the symptom relief effect was accompanied by obvious gut microbiota remodulation.	2
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, body fat distribution, and gut microbiota in young women in Saudi Arabia using the WGS technique. Results show that specific gut microbiota at different taxonomic levels in Saudi Arabian women are associated with measures of glycemic control, which supports previous hypotheses. For instance, some were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (Bacteroides_u_s, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and insulin (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), while others were inversely correlated with HOMA-IR (@gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$, Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense), fasting blood glucose (Actinobacteri, Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense), and insulin (Actinobacteria, @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$, Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense).	2
This study aims to determine whether @gm$ Clostridium butyricum @/gm$ (@gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$) could attenuate @di$ cerebral ischemia/reperfusion @/di$ (I/R) injury and its possible mechanisms. Male ICR mice were intragastrically pretreated with C. butyricum for 2 successive weeks, and then subjected to cerebral I/R injury induced by the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 20min. After 24h of the reperfusion, neurological deficit scores were evaluated. Histopathological changes of the hippocampus neurons were observed using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and TUNEL staining. Malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the brain were detected. The expression of Caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were investigated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. The butyrate contents in the brain were determined. Our results showed that cerebral I/R injury led to neurological deficit, increased levels of Caspase-3 and Bax and decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio. @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ significantly improved neurological deficit, relieved histopathologic change, decreased MDA contents and increased SOD activities in the I/R injury mice. After @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ pretreatment, the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly decreased, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly increased, and butyrate contents in the brain were significantly increased. These findings suggested that @gm$ C. butyricum @/gm$ is able to exert neuroprotective effects against I/R injury mice through anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, and reversing decrease of butyrate contents in the brain might be involved in its neuroprotection.	2
This study characterized two @gm$ lactobacillus @/gm$ strains isolated from the reproductive tract of healthy buffaloes, both phenotypically and genotypically, to evaluate their potential use as a treatment for @di$ endometritis @/di$. In addition to in vitro assays, we also conducted in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy of these probiotic candidates in a live animal model. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize two @gm$ lactobacillus @/gm$ strains from the reproductive tract of healthy buffaloes, both phenotypically and genotypically.	2
This study focussed on the characterization of ArcD, a putative arginine-ornithine antiporter, located in the gene cluster of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ ADS. An association of arcD to the genes of the @di$ ADS @/di$ is common among different bacterial species, but the genetic organization varies substantially. For example, in @gm$ S. suis @/gm$, arcD is located downstream of arcC and closely associated to the putative Xaa-His-dipeptidase arcT (Zuniga et al.,; Gruening et al.,; Hitzmann et al.,).	0
This study investigated the characteristics of humoral immune responses to @gm$ Treponema denticola @/gm$ following primary infection, reinfection, and active immunization, as well as immune protection in mice. Primary infection with @gm$ T. denticola @/gm$ induced a significant (400-fold) serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response compared to that in control uninfected mice. The IgG response to reinfection was 20, 000-fold higher than that for control mice and 10-fold higher than that for primary infection. Mice actively immunized with formalin-killed treponemes developed serum antibody levels seven- to eightfold greater than those in animals after primary infection. Nevertheless, mice with this acquired antibody following primary infection or active immunization demonstrated no significant alterations of lesion induction or decreased size of the @di$ abscesses @/di$ following a challenge infection.	1
This study was undertaken to characterize the kinetics of possible bacterial synergy using a mouse model of mixed intraabdominal infection with @gm$ Bacteroides intermedius @/gm$ and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Female CD-1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with B. intermedius, F. necrophorum or mixtures of both organisms. Generalized septic peritonitis developed within 24 hr, with abscess formation occurring after one to two wk in survivors with the mixed infection. Involvement of the reticuloendothelial system was evidenced by dose-dependent hepatosplenomegaly, which appeared during the first wk postinfection and progressed throughout the course of the experiment. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of both species of bacteria in frozen sections of liver tissue. The median lethal dose (LD50) was 2.11 x 10(9) for the mixture, 3.03 X 10(9) for B. intermedius alone, and 1.07 X 10(9) for F. necrophorum alone. The median abscess-producing dose (AD50), the dose required to produce abscesses in fifty percent of the surviving mice at two wk, was approx. 1/100 of the LD50 dose. The AD50 for intrahepatic abscesses was 2.8 x 10(8) for the mixture, whereas the AD50 for intraabdominal abscesses occurring in any site was 5.14 X 10(7). Both @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ and Fusobacterium persisted in tissue for at least 22 wk following mixed infection. The persistence of the @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ in tissue represents a synergistic result of mixed infection with Fusobacterium and contributed to the chronicity of intraabdominal abscess formation. @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, injected alone, did not produce abscesses at any of the doses tested. However, when passaged (isolated from mixed @di$ infection hepatic abscesses @/di$) B.	1
This subtype (CST IV-C) resembled subtypes CST-IVA and IV-B defined in earlier studies by and, where CST IV-A was differentiated based on higher abundance of Peptoniphilus spp., @gm$ Anaerococcus @/gm$ spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Finegoldia spp., with respect to Lactobacillus species, while CST IV-B was defined by higher abundance of Atopobium spp., in addition to Parvimonas spp., Sneathia spp., Prevotella and Gardnerella. A Gardnerella:dominant CST, classified here as CST VI, has also been identified in African Malawian, African Ghanaian and African Surinamese women as well as in a group of Caucasian Italian women. We also identified a Prevotella:dominant vaginal microbiome which was classified as CST VII. CST VIII was differentiated by a high relative abundance (>50%) of a THPP (Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus species). CST VIII in this study resembles aerobic vaginitis (@di$ AV @/di$) described as an inflammatory vaginal microbial dysbiotic state predominated by enteric commensals (e.g., Enterococcus and Escherichia-Shigella) or pathogens.	1
This was done to evaluate association between the excretion level of each bacterium and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and further to evaluate interactions between bacterial excretion levels of different bacteria and the association to @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Based on model 3, the end-model with the lowest AIC was: @di$ Diarrhea @/di$ ~ F18 excretion level + age group + LI excretion level *age group + @gm$ BP @/gm$ excretion level *age group, with a significant association between increasing F18 excretion level and @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (p < 0.01) and between @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and the interaction between LI excretion level and age group (weaner, p = 0.03). Further, a tendency of association between @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and the interaction between @gm$ BP @/gm$ excretion level and age group was found (weaner, p = 0.05). In contrast to @gm$ BP @/gm$ and F18, increasing excretion level of LI was, overall, not associated with @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in weaner herd samples, since the association was found between the lowest LI excretion level and lack of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (p = 0.01).	1
This was more likely in CD subjects with higher Crohn's Disease Activity Index (184.3 +- 2.9 vs 67.1 +- 82.5, p = 0.012) and active disease status (@di$ Diarrhoea @/di$/abdominal pain/blood-in-stool/fever and fatigue) (p = 0.016). Gut species found to be significantly depleted in CD compared to control (Relative abundance: Median[Range]) include: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (0.03[0.00-4.56] vs 13.69[5.32-18.71], p = 0.010), Roseburia inulinivorans (0.00[0.00-0.03] vs 0.21[0.01-0.53], p = 0.010) and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ (0.00[0.00-0.00] vs 0.00[0.00-0.02], p = 0.029).	2
This was more likely in CD subjects with higher Crohn's Disease Activity Index (184.3 +- 2.9 vs 67.1 +- 82.5, p = 0.012) and active disease status (Diarrhoea/@di$ abdominal pain @/di$/blood-in-stool/fever and fatigue) (p = 0.016). Gut species found to be significantly depleted in CD compared to control (Relative abundance: Median[Range]) include: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (0.03[0.00-4.56] vs 13.69[5.32-18.71], p = 0.010), Roseburia inulinivorans (0.00[0.00-0.03] vs 0.21[0.01-0.53], p = 0.010) and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ (0.00[0.00-0.00] vs 0.00[0.00-0.02], p = 0.029).	2
This was more likely in CD subjects with higher Crohn's Disease Activity Index (184.3 +- 2.9 vs 67.1 +- 82.5, p = 0.012) and active disease status (Diarrhoea/abdominal pain/blood-in-stool/@di$ fever @/di$ and fatigue) (p = 0.016). Gut species found to be significantly depleted in CD compared to control (Relative abundance: Median[Range]) include: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (0.03[0.00-4.56] vs 13.69[5.32-18.71], p = 0.010), Roseburia inulinivorans (0.00[0.00-0.03] vs 0.21[0.01-0.53], p = 0.010) and @gm$ Alistipes senegalensis @/gm$ (0.00[0.00-0.00] vs 0.00[0.00-0.02], p = 0.029).	2
This was seen in zebrafish infected with the WT strain of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$. Compared to those infected with the whiB4::Tn mutant, zebrafish infected with the WT bacteria exhibited higher levels of proinflammatory immune responses at the early time of infection (2 weeks postinfection). This heightened inflammation likely persists during the course of infection and contributes to the @di$ granuloma @/di$ necrotic breakdown, thereby directly supporting bacterial dissemination and multiplication. Consequently, in zebrafish infected with WT or the complemented strain, the bacterial burden was significantly increased at later time points (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-13a was significantly upregulated in zebrafish infected with the WT @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ compared to that in zebrafish infected with the whiB4::Tn mutant (Fig. 3D). The matrix metalloproteinases are major contributors to the @di$ granuloma @/di$ tissue remodeling owing to their abilities to degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagen and proteoglycans. In human TB, several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, and -14, are markedly upregulated in expression in @di$ granulomas @/di$, and it was suggested that the upregulation of MMPs eventually leads to collagen destruction and @di$ granulomas necrosis @/di$. In zebrafish infected with the whiB4::Tn mutant, the overly vigorous inflammation and elevated expression of MMPs were tempered, and consequently, the @di$ granulomas @/di$ remained intact and bacterial growth controlled, leading to persistent infection that resembles latent infection.	1
This work reports the first full inventories of ABC systems within five genome-sequenced @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ strains. There are a number of specific ABC systems/genes that have previously been identified in the published literature. For example, Paulsen et al. describe two ABC systems that are present in @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ and absent in B. melitensis. The first of these is an ABC importer encoded by BR0952 (IM), BR0953 (IM), and BR0955 (BP). Although this particular system is listed in the inventory, the ABC protein component of the system was not located in the @di$ BS @/di$ genome and so this system was deemed incomplete and unlikely to be functional.	0
This would suggest these species would not fit into species of the advanced aciduric phase of @di$ dental caries @/di$ from the Takahashi/Nyvad model. In contrast S. mutans, Streptococcus anginosus, @gm$ Streptococcus salivarius @/gm$, Lactobacillus gasseri, Scardovia wiggsiae, Parascardovia denticolens and Bifidobacterium dentium were detected more frequently from the acid agar and could be candidates for the advanced aciduric stage of @di$ caries @/di$ progression.	1
This, along with our finding that s-OTUs of @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ were enriched with higher whole grain intake, may reflect the association of Blautia genus with visceral fat accumulation and @di$ obesity @/di$.	1
Those pathogens that present the greatest threat to infant health include Cronobacter species (formerly known as @gm$ Enterobacter sakazakii @/gm$) and Salmonella enterica, two bacterial genera designated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as Class A pathogens. Following the consumption and ingestion of contaminated foods, clinical signs of infection include @di$ gastroenteritis @/di$ which can progress to bacteraemia and meningitis (Cahill et al.,).	1
Though entirely speculative, spironolactone therapy in the context of epithelial barrier loss could act synergistically with the @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ toxins to increase inflammation severity and mortality. During CDI, toxin A disrupts the epithelial barrier from the apical side, potentiating toxin B access to receptors in the basolateral side. While toxin B is essential for virulence, toxin B alone does not cause symptoms unless mucosal damage has occurred. Toxin B, via a Rho/Rac signaling pathway, induces inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), subsequent loss of epithelial barrier function, increased permeability, increased chloride secretion, and @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
Three major factors for the development @gm$ of @/gm$ uric acid (UA) stones are low urine volume, acidic urine pH, and hyperuricosuria. However, abnormally acidic urine is the principal determinate in UA crystallization. The etiologic mechanisms for UA stone formation are diverse, and include congenital, acquired, and idiopathic causes. The most prevalent cause @gm$ of @/gm$ UA nephrolithiasis is idiopathic. In its initial description, the term 'gouty diathesis' was coined. The clinical and biochemical presentation @gm$ of @/gm$ idiopathic UA nephrolithiasis (IUAN) cannot be attributed to an inborn error of metabolism or secondary causes such as chronic @di$ diarrhea @/di$, strenuous physical exercise, and a high purine diet.	0
Three methanogenic species, Methanobrevibacter smithii , Methanosphaera stadtmanae  and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis , have been isolated from human stools, and @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$ has been isolated from the subgingival plaque. In addition to their role in the local homeostasis of anaerobic communities, methanogenic archaea are suspected to be involved in digestive tract diseases and @di$ obesity @/di$ and have been implicated in periodontitis.	1
Three patients had an associated co-infection, one patient had Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection, other patient had disseminated histoplasmosis, and another had polymicrobial soft tissue infection with Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$, later complicated with ventilator-associated pneumonia. One patient died due to HIV/AIDS complicated with disseminated histoplasmosis and respiratory failure. All patients with @di$ bacteremia @/di$ had a previous history of immunosuppression, and all of them died.	1
Three patients with an acute @di$ colitis @/di$ in which the only pathogen detected was either Aeromonas hydrophila or @gm$ A sobria @/gm$ progressed to a chronic phase after the infection had been eliminated by antibiotic treatment in two and had resolved spontaneously in the third. The final diagnosis in each case was ulcerative colitis. Two of the patients have responded to anti-inflammatory medication but one has required panproctocolectomy. The sequence of symptoms and observations in these cases, as well as in others from the literature involving more familiar pathogens, suggests that bacterial infection may contribute to the development of @di$ chronic colitis @/di$. This supposition could be tested by extending the follow up of patients with acute @di$ infective colitis @/di$ in a prospective multicentre trial.	1
Three selected South African @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ field isolates were identified and inoculated via the caudal abdominal airsac into 28-day-old broilers, which were monitored under controlled laboratory conditions. It was concluded from data that the @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ isolates were capable of causing primary disease, with statistically significant resultant mass loss. Respiratory and arthritis symptoms were reproduced. However, no @di$ sinusitis @/di$ was observed. Airsacculitis- and arthritis-lesion scoring techniques showed significant pathogenicity differences between isolates. Furthermore, differences in symptomatology were also seen between isolates. A highly significant reisolation of @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ was made from the brains of broilers challenged with isolate 2.	0
Three species of CPE isolates, Enterobacter cloacae, @gm$ Klebsiella aerogenes @/gm$ and Serratia marcescens, were isolated from a patient who developed severe @di$ gallstone pancreatitis @/di$ associated with bloodstream infection, with all three isolates producing IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase. The complete sequences of the plasmids of the three isolates were determined by both MiSeq and MinION. The medical chart of this patient was retrospectively reviewed conducted to obtain relevant clinical information. RESULTS: The three CPE species carried an IncL/M plasmid, pSL264, which was 81,133 bp in size and harbored blaIMP-1. The genetic environment surrounding blaIMP-1 consisted of int1-blaIMP-1-aac(6')-IIc-qacL-qacEdelta1-sul1-istB-IS21. Conjugation experiments showed that S. marcescens could transmit the plasmid to E. cloacae and @gm$ K. aerogenes @/gm$. In contrast, pSL264 could not transfer from E. cloacae or @gm$ K. aerogenes @/gm$ to S.	1
Three weeks later, she returned to the emergency department with fevers, @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, chills, and nausea. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis, and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a liver abscess. Interventional radiology placed an 8 French drainage catheter in the hepatic abscess and drained 40cc of purulent fluid. A culture of the abscess fluid revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Bacteroides fragilis, and @gm$ Bacteroides ovatus @/gm$.	1
Through this large-scale analysis of wave 2 of the ORIGINS cohort, we identified a simple microbial signature based on two common oral taxa associated with periodontal status that also correlates with biomarkers of @di$ cardiometabolic disease @/di$. Importantly, these microbial community composition transitions appear to occur early in disease before severe periodontitis is evident or clinical cardiovascular disease develops. The results from this analysis suggest that these microbial changes occur first in plaque, and as disease progresses can be identified in saliva. Future longitudinal sampling will allow for more definitive determinations of how the @gm$ Treponema @/gm$:Corynebacterium ratio is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of @di$ periodontal and cardiometabolic diseases @/di$.	1
Thus, Parasutterella secunda, @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, and Clostridium saccharogumia, which are related to FA, might be potential targets for regulating the production of FA to ameliorate @di$ fatty liver @/di$.	2
Thus, in this study, we sought to define the contribution of the IL-1R signaling in the @di$ peritonitis @/di$ caused by GAS. As with GAS also for @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ previous studies have investigated the role of IL-1 signaling in the outcome of @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ infection using different mouse models of infection including brain abscesses and septic arthritis. The results of these studies showed that bone-marrow-derived cells play key roles in most, but not all, experimental murine models of @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ infection where IL-1R-dependent neutrophil recruitment is fundamental on the outcome of @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ infection.	1
Thus, oral biofilms are involved in a number of dental diseases, among which caries and @di$ periodontitis @/di$ are the most frequent. A diverse array of acidogenic and aciduric species including Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacilli, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., and Atopobium spp. are involved in caries development. Tannerella forsythia, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$, Filifactor alocis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans have been frequently associated with @di$ periodontitis @/di$. Oral biofilms are also considered the cause of peri-implantitis, an oral implant-associated disease that is correlated with bone loss and subsequent treatment failure. A shift in the subgingival oral biofilm composition with increased levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ spp., and Tannerella forsythia has been shown to be associated with peri-implantitis. From an ecological perspective, it should be emphasized that all oral infections are semi-specific and should be considered as cause of the total microbiota composition of the oral biofilm, rather than by specific species. The oral health status is the consequence of a subtle equilibrium between the host and the microbiota, whereby a destruction of this balance can lead to oral diseases such as caries, @di$ periodontitis @/di$, and peri-implantitis.	1
Thus, the reactivity of these adaptive gammadelta T cells was evaluated in response to the foodborne pathogens Lm, @gm$ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis @/gm$ (@gm$ Yp @/gm$) and Citrobacter rodentium (Cr) and the murine model of STm-induced @di$ colitis @/di$. These pathogens represent a broad group of bacteria with diverse replicative life cycles. Instead of a tightly restricted specificity, our data revealed a broad TCR-mediated reactivity of Lm-elicited memory Vgamma4Vdelta1 T cells against pathogenic bacteria that is driven by a combination of clones expressing canonical and non-canonical Vdelta1 TCRs. Although the majority of the response was carried out by cells expressing canonical TCRs, a substantial proportion of non-canonical clones were expanded upon Lm or STm infection, indicating that some form of selection occurs after infection. Interestingly, a very small number of non-canonical clones appeared to cross-react against both Lm and STm-induced @di$ colitis infections @/di$, contributing to both responses.	1
Thus, the triggering of the SLC26A3 gene by LAM may compensate at least in part the endotoxin-induced activation of chloride channels and may reduce the occurrence of @di$ diarrhea @/di$. This can explain the small improvement of villus height in LAM-perfused loops. Also @gm$ Lactobacillus acidophilus @/gm$ stimulated the expression of SLC26A3 via a transcriptional mechanism. Interestingly, among the first genes downregulated by LAM was cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (seventh in the ranking order produced by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis). CFTR is a cAMP- and phosphorylation-regulated chloride/bicarbonate channel, regulating the chloride efflux; thus, its activation is involved in enterotoxin-induced secretory @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	2
Thus, they are often isolated from the oral cavity, for example, in periodontitis or @di$ sinusitis @/di$. There are six known species of Veillonella: Veillonella parvula, Veillonella alcalescens, Veillonella atypica, Veillonella dispar, @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, and Megasphaera elsdenii.	0
Thus, we verified whether this cytokine is involved in eosinophil accumulation in response to @gm$ MSS @/gm$. To do so, mice were given 50 mug i.p. of anti-IL-17A antibodies 1 h prior to 3 mug @gm$ MSS @/gm$ exposure, and the @di$ airway inflammatory @/di$ response was evaluated.	1
Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant @gm$ Acinetobacter baumannii @/gm$ or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, @di$ endocarditis @/di$ and osteomyelitis.	1
To address this gap in knowledge, we treated germ-free mice with (i) KCO alone; (ii) @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ and E. coli; (iii) KCO, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, and E. coli; or (iv) water (control). Interestingly, H&E staining showed significantly higher inflammation in the colon and rectum than in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In addition, the combination of KCO with KCO-degrading bacteria resulted in the strongest proinflammatory effect. It was previously shown that the administration of CGN into the mouse pleural cavity induces @di$ pleurisy @/di$ by activating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. Here, p38 and p-p38 were upregulated in the mouse rectal samples, especially in samples from mice treated with a combination of KCO, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, and E. coli. IHC using p-p38 revealed a low degree of inflammation in the groups treated with @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$ and E. coli or KCO alone, but a significant increase in inflammation in the KCO, @gm$ B. xylanisolvens @/gm$, and E.	1
To determine key bacteria implicated in the development of obesity-related CRC, we performed metagenomic sequencing on stool samples from human donors and recipient germ-free mice, observing significant enrichments of @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ in OB-G mice, and depletion of beneficial microbes B. vulgatus and A. muciniphila. Our validation experiments confirmed the anticancer effects of B. vulgatus and A. muciniphila and the promotion effect of @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$, suggesting that these depletion/enrichment patterns predict higher CRC risk in obesity. Importantly, these findings support previous research that has shown @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ to be, among other things, sufficient to induce CRC in mice via certain pathways. Meanwhile, A. muciniphila has been found to be protective against obesity, diabetes, inflammation, and CRC, among other conditions. Similarly in our previous study conglomerating shotgun metagenomic sequencing data from four cohorts including 271 controls and 255 CRC cases, @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ was enriched among CRC cases. A previous study showed that @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ was sufficient to induce CRC via the IL-6/STAT3 pathways in Il10-/- mice. On the other hand, B. vulgatus is depleted in patients with metabolic disorders and CRC. Animal studies have demonstrated the role of B. vulgatus in attenuating body weight gain in diet-induced obesity, protecting against @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ and colitis, reducing inflammation and repairing intestinal damage.	1
To elucidate the bacterial etiology of childhood @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in Dhahira, Oman, studied 856 children <12 years admitted for @di$ diarrhea @/di$, often bloody, to Ibri Regional Referral Hospital from 2000 to 2002. Bacterial etiology was found in 15.2% of cases, and this study suggests that Shigella (mainly S. sonnei but also S. flexneri), @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, and enteropathogenic E.	1
To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of M101 in vivo, a calvarial subcutaneous abscess was induced by @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ injection in mice. Clinical assessment of untreated and M101-treated (1 g/L) subcutaneous @di$ inflammatory calvarial lesions @/di$ in mice was carried out by measuring the clinical abscess size over a period of 5 days (Fig. 10A,B). M101-treated mice demonstrated a significantly decreased abscess size, on average 50.23%, when compared to the untreated control mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 10C). Histomorphometric analysis of mice with @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-induced subcutaneous inflammatory @di$ calvarial lesion @/di$ treated with M101 exhibited an appreciably reduced inflammatory cell infiltrate in soft tissue compartment (derma/subderma) (Fig.	1
To evaluate the efficacy of a novel attenuated @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ ( lon cpxR) vaccine candidate (JOL919), chickens were immunized through oral and intramuscular routes to reduce egg contamination against @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ challenge. Birds were orally immunized with JOL919 on the first day of life and were subsequently boosted in the 6th and 16th weeks through oral (group B) or intramuscular (group C) route, while control birds were unimmunized (group A). The chickens of all groups were challenged intravenously with the virulent @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ strain in the 24th week. The immunized groups B and C showed significantly higher plasma IgG and intestinal secretory IgA levels as compared to those of the control group. The lymphocyte proliferation response and CD45(+) CD3(+) T-cell number in the peripheral blood of the groups B and C were significantly increased. In addition, the egg contamination rates were significantly lower in the group B (0%, 10.7% and 0%) and the group C (3.6%, 14.3% and 3.6%) as compared to the group A (28.6%, 42.8% and 28.6%) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks post-challenge. All animals in the groups B and C showed lower @di$ organ lesion @/di$ scores in the liver and spleen and lower bacterial counts in the liver, spleen and ovary at the 3rd week post-challenge. These results indicate that this vaccine candidate can be an efficient tool for prevention of Salmonella infections by inducing protective humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, this vaccine did not prevent egg contamination, but did appear to reduce incidence. Booster immunizations, especially via oral administration route, showed an efficient protection against internal egg contamination with @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$.	1
To evaluate whether MTX influences the composition of intestinal microbiota in @di$ arthritis @/di$, stool samples were collected from 21 RA patients before and after MTX treatment. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to assess the relationship between gut microbiota and clinical response. Unlike the results of animal experiments, the alpha diversity of gut bacteria did not change significantly after MTX treatment in all patients (Figure 1A). PCoA and venn diagram showed that the composition of gut microbiota was altered after MTX treatment (Figures 1B-D). Clustering heatmap of species abundance showed the changes of 30 bacteria, among which 14 bacteria had increased, such as @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, and 16 bacteria had decreased, such as Escherichia coli (Figure 1E).	0
To explore signatures of the gut microbiome in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ patients and controls, we integrated the sequencing data into an existing gut microbial reference gene catalog to obtain a set of 5.3 million genes, which allowed for saturation mapping of the reads (80.3%). Using the MGWAS methods, we identified 53,953 genes that showed a significant difference between two groups (FDR corrected q < 0.05). Approximately, 69% of these genes were clustered into 68 metagenome linkage groups (MLGs, Table S2), that allowed to species level description for the microbiome differences. Thirty-one MLGs were higher in patients while 37 in controls. Consistent with the genus level observations, MLGs of Klebsiella (mainly consisting of K. pneumoniae and K. variicola), Streptococcus (S. infantarius, S. pasteurianus and S. salivarius), and @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ were found to be higher in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ samples, whereas MLGs of Roseburia (mainly consisting of R. intestinalis and R. hominis) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were higher in controls. Moreover, the MLGs enriched in @di$ hypertensive @/di$ patients also contain several Bacteroides spp. (including B. eggerthii and B. cellulosilyticus), Sutterella wadsworthensis and Pyramidobacter piscolens, and the MLGs enriched in controls include several other Bacteroides spp. (including B. uniformis, B. nordii and B. dorei), Megasphaera spp. (M. micronuciformis), and Aeromicrobium massiliense. A co-occurrence network on these MLGs revealed a large number of interconnections within @di$ hypertension @/di$-enriched and control-enriched MLGs (Figure 2A), as well as some MLGs derived from two groups negatively correlated.	1
To explore usefulness of the engineered @di$ BCD @/di$ with P710V4 and eSD2 in @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$, we examined the production of three recombinant proteins: (i) glutathione-S-transferase (GST), (ii) human growth hormone (hGH), and (iii) alpha-amylase. First, for the production of the relatively small (26 kDa) and soluble GST, four plasmids pCB4270B-GST, pCB4270V4B-GST, pCB4270BU-GST, and pCB4270V4BU-GST, which employed P710-SD2, P710V4-SD2, P710-eSD2, and P710V4-eSD2 in the @di$ BCD @/di$, respectively, were constructed. After cultivation in shake flask, the production yield of GST in each expression system was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4a, gene expressions in all @di$ BCD @/di$ systems were higher than that in the MCD system (pCB4270-GST). Also, we found the expression levels of GST were increased by combining each isolated part (P710V4 and eSD2) and original part (P710 and SD2) (Fig. 4a). Among four BCDs, the @di$ BCD @/di$ system with P710V4-eSD2 (pCB4270V4BU-GST) exhibited 3.4-fold higher production of GST than that in the original @di$ BCD @/di$ (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. S5). In each @di$ BCD @/di$ and MCD system, the transcription level was also determined by qRT-PCR and, similarly to sfGFP expression (Fig. 3c), higher transcriptions were observed under the P710V4 than the original P710 irrespective of SD sequence (Supplementary Fig. S9). Additionally, it was confirmed that the activity of soluble GST showed good correlation with expression strength (Supplementary Fig. S6). Among all examined systems, the combination of P710V4 and eSD2 also exhibited the highest activity, which was 4-fold and 18-fold higher than those of original @di$ BCD @/di$ and MCD, respectively.	0
To explore whether there were features of the gut microbiota that discriminated @di$ M. tuberculosis infection @/di$ status, we first employed a random forest model to distinguish between healthy and diseased states based on species abundance profiles. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation using the training set (n = 31 and 30 for controls and patients, respectively) led to the optimal selection of three species markers, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and two butyrate-producing bacteria, @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ and R.	0
To further explore the specific interactions of the microbial communities, we constructed three different networks at the species level in IBS subtypes of IBS-C, IBS-D and IBS with @di$ psychiatric disorders @/di$. We observed similar interaction modules in the three groups (Fig. 6B-D). By calculating the MCC, the top 10 hub species were identified in the three groups, respectively (Additional file 10: Table S10). We observed that six hub species were commonly shared by the three subgroups: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Blautia lutim, Roseburia inulinivorans, Bacteroides acidifaciens, @gm$ Bifidobacterium merycicum @/gm$ and Bacteroides luti.	0
To identify bacterial species having different abundances between @di$ stillbirth @/di$ and normal sows, 72 fecal samples from the DN1 and DN2 cohorts were performed metagenomic sequencing analysis (Methods). Among the 20 most abundant species in both cohorts, Escherichia coli, Prevotella copri, Lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri were predominant ( Figures S3A ,  S3B ). The bacterial species with relative abundance >= 0.01% in each cohort were used for association analysis. LEfSe analysis detected 17 and 37 bacterial species showing significantly different abundances between @di$ stillbirth @/di$ and normal sows in the DN1 and DN2 cohort, respectively. ( Figure 4A ,  Supplement Table S4 ). Interestingly, three Bacteroides species including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Bacteroides pyogenes, Paenibacillus sp. P22, Treponema porcinum were mainly enriched in the @di$ stillbirth @/di$ sow group. Consistent with the results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, several bacterial species that could produce SCFAs had higher abundance in the gut of normal sows, such as Clostridium butyricum, @gm$ Eubacterium ramulus @/gm$, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Prevotella copri. Additionally, some pathogens or opportunistic pathogens had higher abundance in the gut of @di$ stillbirth @/di$ sows, such as Clostridium baratii and Turicibacter sanguinis in the DN1 cohort, Desulfomicrobium orale, Cupriavidus taiwanensis, Campylobacter hyointestinalis, Desulfovibrio piger, Ruthenibacterium sp, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Clostridium botulinum, Bacteroides pyogenes, and Parabacteroides distasonis in the DN2 cohort.	1
To investigate how WLD altered bacteria compared to the wider population, pre-intervention and post-intervention time points were compared with normal weight, @di$ overweight @/di$, and obese reference groups. Further analysis included only taxa, which were significantly altered in the intervention. No significant difference in bacterial abundances was detected between the obese reference group and the WLD group (Figure 5c, Figure A4). On the other hand, compared to the normal weight reference group, the abundance of Christensenellaceae and Dorea were lower and higher, respectively, in the WLD group. Overall, most of the taxa, which were significantly shifted in response to WLD, also exhibited distinct relative abundances in post-WLD samples compared to bacterial levels in reference groups. Most coherent differences between post-WLD samples and reference groups were detected among Rikenellaceae and @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, which were significantly increased compared to their populations in all reference groups. Similarly, a decline in the abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed in post-WLD samples compared to that in all reference groups. In addition, post-interventional levels of B. vulgatus and Enterobacteriaceae were higher than those in the normal weight reference group. The abundance of B. vulgatus was also higher in the post-WLD group compared to that in the @di$ overweight @/di$ reference group. In contrast, the abundance of C. aerofaciens was significantly lower after WLD compared to that in the normal weight and @di$ overweight @/di$ reference group.	0
To investigate the profiles of gut mucosal microbiota associated with @di$ CRC @/di$ recurrence and survival of @di$ CRC @/di$ patients, we collected gut mucosal microbiota from @di$ CRC @/di$ patients when they received radical resection or palliative surgery in Tianjin Union Medical Center, China. For each patient, triplet-paired @di$ CRC @/di$ samples were collected from on-tumor, adjacent-tumor and off-tumor sites. Additional samples were collected from 26 healthy controls. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and analyses on these gut mucosal microbiota. Next, we carried out Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses for OS and DFS. Our data suggest that a number of bacterial genera/families, including @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$, Bacteroidales, Coriobacteriaceae, Dialister, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Filifactor, Gemella, Haemophilus, Mogibacteriazeae, Pyramidobacter, Parvimonas, Porphyromonadaceae, Slackia, Schwartzia, TG5 and Treponema, are associated with survival of @di$ CRC @/di$ patients and @di$ CRC @/di$ recurrence. We further performed the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Our data reveal that high abundance of @gm$ Anaerotruncus @/gm$, Bacteroidales, Coriobacteriaceae, Dialister, Eubacterium, Filifactor, Haemophilus, Mogibacteriazeae, Pyramidobacter, Slackia, Treponema and TG5 are associated with worse OS or DFS.	1
To investigate the viable translocated members of Enterobacteriaceae in the mesenteric tissues, we cultured 23 specimens (14 @di$ CD @/di$ and 9 non-@di$ CD @/di$) under anaerobic and aerobic conditions and picked 229 colonies (174 from @di$ CD @/di$ and 55 from control) with different colony appearances on different culture plates. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that these colonies were classified into 17 families (Figure  2A), with 13 families identified in the mesenteric tissue of @di$ CD @/di$ and seven in the non-@di$ CD @/di$ control (Figure 2B). Totally, 32 colonies belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were identified from the MAT of patients with @di$ CD @/di$, which were categorized into four taxa groups (Escherichia fergusonii, @gm$ Klebsiella variicola @/gm$, Shigella flexneri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D, Escherichia/Shigella were repeatedly isolated from the mesenteric tissue of @di$ CD @/di$ and the control group, whereas Klebsiella spp. were exclusively isolated from the mesenteric tissue of @di$ CD @/di$ (Figure 2D). Observation of Klebsiella spp. in @di$ CD @/di$-MAT was verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$-specific probes under sterile conditions (Figure 2E).	1
To investigate this hypothesis, we focused our studies on the @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ yxjA guanine riboswitch, a transcriptional 'OFF' riboswitch that downregulates the expression of a nucleoside transporter protein in response to excess guanine as a part of nucleotide biosynthesis pathway regulation. As part of the purine-sensing riboswitch family, the yxjA riboswitch shares 75.4% sequence conservation and a similar predicted AD structure with the adenine-responsive @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ pbuE riboswitch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). These @di$ AD @/di$ aptamers consist of a P1 helix at the base of a three-way junction (3WJ), with two protruding P2 and P3 helices that are oriented through a kissing hairpin pseudoknot interaction (Figure 1A).	0
To investigate whether other Bacteroides and their propionate protect against @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$, we obtained other Bacteroides species, including @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and B. thetaiotaomicron, and produced a mutant form (Delta1686-1689) of B. thetaiotaomicron with a defect in propionate production. As expected, @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and B. thetaiotaomicron produced propionate, acetate, and isovalerate, but not butyrate or valerate, to varying extents ( Figures 6A, B  and data not shown). In contrast, the propionate-producing ability of B. thetaiotaomicron disappeared in the mutant form, despite the unabated production of acetate and isovalerate ( Figure 6B ). Similar to B. vulgatus, @gm$ B. caccae @/gm$ and B. thetaiotaomicron significantly ameliorated edema at the footpads and ankles compared to the control ( Figure 6C ). However, the beneficial effects of B. thetaiotaomicron on @di$ arthritis @/di$ disappeared in the mutant form of B. thetaiotaomicron ( Figures 6C ,  S7 ). Bacteroides-producing propionate may therefore be responsible for the colitis-induced amelioration of @di$ inflammatory arthritis @/di$.	2
To our knowledge, this is the first case report of mandibular osteomyelitis caused by @gm$ Raoultella @/gm$ species. In contrast to other forms of @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$, the pathogenesis of mandibular osteomyelitis involves contiguous spread from an odontogenic focus.	1
To reinstate the normal microflora consisting of a high abundance of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp., researchers hypothesized that probiotics containing @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. could be a possible choice in maintaining vaginal homeostasis (Figure 1). The general definition of probiotics is termed as live microbial feed supplements which can be taken orally or applied to have good health benefits when administered in sufficient amounts. There has been an increase in demand over the years due to the emerging evidence regarding probiotics' potential role to modify the flora in improving several medical conditions such as acute diarrhea, eczema, and @di$ genitourinary infections @/di$. For BV, it is hypothesized that apart from its bacteriocin production (including hydrogen peroxide) and host immunomodulatory properties, probiotics confer anti-adhesion properties via competition for the binding site, displacing the other pathogens from the adhesion site on the vaginal epithelium. On top of that, some studies demonstrated that probiotics like @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp. decrease the adhesion of pathogens on the surface epithelium by producing biosurfactants with anti-biofilm activities. Studying the clinical trials that describe the efficacy of probiotics against BV, patients were given either probiotics consisting of a single strain or multi-strain (i.e., a combination of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp.	2
"To support our in vitro findings, we compared expression of adipose tissue genes from mice treated with TXN versus those from mice fed a control diet with mice supplemented daily with @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ (109 CFU) for 4-5 weeks in our previous study. We found that 75 genes (73 up- and 2 down-regulated by the microbe) out of 98 genes modulated by @gm$ O. valericigenes @/gm$ administration were improved by TXN treatment in vivo. Of these genes, 17 (e.g., Mmp12, Lgals3, and Plin2) belonged to the IR-ATM signature (Fig. 5A-C, Supplementary Table 4). Of note, another microbe (L. gasseri) common to microbiota of HFD-fed mice but not predicted by our analysis as potential inducer of @di$ adipose inflammation @/di$ (see ""Methods"") did not stimulate increase of expression of immune genes either in vitro (Figure S5A, lower panel, Supplementary Table 5) or in vivo (Figure S5B)."	1
To test this hypothesis, Devkota et al compared two diets high in polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat or in saturated fat (milk) and found that the latter increased the rate of colitis in genetically susceptible mice as well as the levels of the sulphite-reducing pathobiont @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$. Caesar et al demonstrated that mice fed a diet high in saturated fat developed obesity-related white adipose tissue inflammation while mice fed fish oil showed no metabolic disease. Feeding a lard-based high-fat diet to mice altered the composition of the gut microbiota (i. e. increased Enterobacteriaceae and decreased Bifidobacteria) and led to increased intestinal permeability, which resulted in higher levels of endotoxins in both the gut and plasma, thereby accelerating obesity. When compared to n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6/n-3 PUFAs), saturated fats were the only to increase @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, colonic permeability, and mesenteric fat inflammation and these intestinal and metabolic outcomes were associated with shifts in hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria.	1
To test this, we examined the effects of EEN IN on @di$ colitis @/di$ development, the gut microbiome, and CD4+ T cells using an adoptive T-cell transfer model of @di$ colitis @/di$. METHODS: TCR-beta deficient (-/-) mice were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: (1) Control, (2) Chow, (3) EEN, and (4) EEN IN, and naive CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred into groups 2-4, after which mice were monitored for 5 weeks before experimental endpoint. RESULTS: Mice fed EEN IN showed greater @di$ colitis @/di$ protection, with colonic shortening, goblet cell, and crypt density loss reduced compared with EEN fed mice and reduced disease activity and immune cell infiltration compared with chow fed mice, and less crypt hyperplasia and higher survival compared with both groups. EEN IN mice had less deterioration in the colonic mucus layer and had increased levels of Foxp3+IL-10+ and Rorgammat+IL-22+ and reduced levels of Tbet+IFNgamma+ and Tbet+TNF+ CD4+ T cells. EEN IN also led to higher butyrate concentrations, Bifidobacterium spp. and @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$ relative abundance, and lower [Clostridium] innocuum group spp. and Escherichia-Shigella spp. relative abundance. CONCLUSIONS: The EEN IN group showed reduced @di$ colitis @/di$ development as compared with the chow and EEN groups.	2
To the Editor: Alistipes finegoldii was previously isolated from appendiceal tissue samples in children with acute appendicitis and from perirectal and @di$ brain abscess @/di$ material. 16S rDNA sequencing studies showed that this bacterium clustered with @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ (Figure) in the Bacteroidetes group.	0
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Shigella bacteraemia in a @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$ patient coinfected with C. difficile. A possible cause of this bacteraemia may have been malnutrition, since our patient had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as a complication of @di$ cystic fibrosis @/di$. Some authors have reported that malnutrition may facilitate an invasive presentation because it produces decreased secretion of immunoglobulins, complement and other proteins involved in opsonization and lysis of micro-organisms, as well as increasing transferrin saturation. The normal immunological values obtained in our patient, however, would seem to rule out the hypothesis of malnutrition as facilitating this presentation. On the other hand, coinfection with C. difficile would probably contribute to intestinal barrier damage and facilitate the translocation of @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ to the blood. The association of the two toxins (C.difficile and @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$) would probably have exacerbated the seriousness of the case, leading to septic and cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure in the patient.	1
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the characteristics of the oral microbiome in elderly Japanese people with >=20 teeth with a non-severe @di$ periodontal condition @/di$ and compare them to those with severe @di$ periodontitis @/di$. The present study focused on the diversity and specific species of bacteria in non-severe @di$ periodontal conditions @/di$. Evenness differed significantly between the non-severe and severe groups. The relative abundances of four bacterial species (P. nanceiensis, G. sanguinis, F. periodonticum, and @gm$ H. parainfluenzae @/gm$) were found to be greater in the non-severe group than those in the severe group.	2
To treat @di$ dehydration @/di$ from diarrhea and vomiting, water and electrolytes are administered orally. Patients with severe vomiting or sickness are administered water and electrolytes intravenously. Most cases of dysentery self-resolve over time and do not require antibiotics, but severe cases of dysentery may require antibiotics. Antibiotics can be used to shorten the duration of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ excretion, that is, to reduce the spread of the bacterium. Since 2000, the rates of antimicrobial resistance of @gm$ S. sonnei @/gm$ isolated in Korea have been high, with rates reaching 91% for ampicillin, 41% for ampicillin/sulbactam, 9% for kanamycin, and 82% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	1
To understand whether these processes are involved in the @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-induced vascular calcification, we assessed the status of apoptosis in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-infected @di$ VSMCs @/di$, using propidium iodide staining. P. gingivalis infection significantly increased the Pi-induced apoptosis of @di$ VSMCs @/di$ (by 8.8~15.3% compared to that in non-infected cells) (Figure 3a). Apoptosis-induced DNA fragments were detected in the TUNEL assay. As shown in Figure 3b, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells increased sharply when calcified @di$ VSMCs @/di$ were infected with @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$. To explore the mechanism through which @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$ enhances the Pi-induced apoptosis in @di$ VSMCs @/di$, the expression levels of various pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3c, the level of cleaved caspase-3 and Bad increased due to exposure to high concentrations of Pi and even further upon P. gingivalis infection. We also found that P. gingivalis infection drastically reduces the expression of Bcl2 protein in calcified @di$ VSMCs @/di$. Inorganic phosphate has been shown to induce apoptosis and calcification of @di$ VSMCs @/di$ through inhibiting Gas6/Axl/Akt survival pathway. Therefore, we examined whether the Gas6/Axl/Akt survival pathway was altered during Pi-induced apoptosis. We found that exposure to 2.6 mM Pi markedly down-regulated the expression of Gas6 and Axl and led to Akt inactivation, and this suppression was far more significant in @gm$ P. gingivalis @/gm$-infected cells (Figure 3d). Next, through collagenase digestion, matrix vesicles were isolated from the lysates of calcified @di$ VSMCs @/di$ with and without P.	1
Together, this suggests that AAV9-mediated transduction is predominantly determined by myofiber types whereas @gm$ AAV6 @/gm$ transduction is determined primarily by myofiber size. Variations in transduction efficiency between AAV serotypes and different muscles are not fully understood. The TA muscle is more effectively transduced by AAV9 vector compared to the soleus muscle. However, AAV6 is more effective for soleus transduction over AAV2. AAV1 transduction in dog models for @di$ muscular diseases @/di$ seems to be more effective compared to mice.	0
Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and @di$ phlegmon @/di$. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, @gm$ Haemophilus parainfluenzae @/gm$ one strain) were eradicated.	1
Triphala has been used in traditional medicine practice against certain diseases such as jaundice, @di$ fever @/di$, cough, eye diseases etc. In the present study phytochemical (phenolic, flavonoid and carotenoid) and antibacterial activities of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala and its individual components (Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica and Emblica officinalis) were tested against certain bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi-B @/gm$, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi) obtained from HIV infected patients using Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods.	0
Twenty PDOX mice were divided into 4 groups: G1, control without treatment; G2, @gm$ Salmonella typhimurium @/gm$ (@gm$ S. typhimurium @/gm$)A1-R administered by intratumoral (i.t.) injection once a week for 4 weeks; G3, doxorubicin (DOX) administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection once a week for 4 weeks; G4, S. typhimurium A1-R (i.t.) administered once a week for 2 weeks followed by i.p. doxorubicin once a week for 2 weeks. On day 25 from the initiation of treatment, tumor volume in G2, G3, and G4 was significantly lower than G1. Mice found without gross tumor included one mouse (20%) in G2; one mouse (20%) in G3; and 3 mice (60%) in G4. Body @di$ weight loss @/di$ did not significantly differ between the 3 treated groups or from the untreated control.	2
Twenty-three (22.33%) were positive for multidrug-resistant (MDR) @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ NDM. All of them were analysed, and no data were missed. Fourteen of 23 patients died (60.87%), and 9 (39.13%) survived. The duration of hospitalisation was between 9 and 47 days (median 22, interquartile range 17-34). The characteristics of the analysed patients, their comorbidities, and empiric and targeted antimicrobial therapy are presented in Table 1. Five of 23 patients (21.74%) were otherwise healthy. Of the 23 patients who were positive for @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ NDM, 11 (47.83%) suffered from cardiovascular problems, including arterial hypertension (8/23, 34.78%) and heart disease (3/23, 13.04%). Six (26.09%) suffered from @di$ obesity @/di$, five (21.74%) from diabetes, four (17.39%) had some neurological problems, four (17.39%) were heavy smokers, one (4.35%) suffered from chronic kidney disease, and one (4.35%) had a history of alcohol abuse.	0
Two cases of @di$ odontogenic abscesses @/di$ were noted in the study group II caused by S. aureus and @gm$ Prevotella melaninogenica @/gm$.	1
Two children developed @di$ erythema nodosum @/di$ due to @gm$ Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis @/gm$. Neither case showed typical signs of P. pseudotuberculosis infection, but this cause was shown by positive agglutination tests. It is suggested that this organism is a more common cause of @di$ erythema nodosum @/di$ than is at present recognized.	1
Two different wild-type strains of @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ were used in this study: the human isolate, M. marinum M strain, originally isolated from human patients with fish tank @di$ granulomas @/di$, and the sea bass isolate M. marinum E11. In addition, we used the eccCb1::tn mutant of E11, which is known to be defective for ESX-1 secretion. All @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ strains were grown at 30 C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) with 10% Middlebrook albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC; BD Bioscience) and 0.05% Tween-80 or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% oleic-acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; BD Bioscience).	1
Two of the most common human diseases, dental caries and @di$ periodontitis @/di$, are directly related to the presence and metabolic activities of dental plaque bacteria. A recent analysis that compared supragingival plaque microbiomes from carious lesions to healthy sites found substantial differences among children with different caries status. In particular, communities collected from dentin carious lesions contained notorious acidogenic (acid producing) and aciduric (acid tolerant) species, including S. mutans, Scardovia wiggsiae, Parascardovia denticolens, and Lactobacillus salivarius. In contrast, S. sanguinis, Neisseria species, and Leptotrichia species were found associated with samples collected from healthy sites. However, a decrease in species diversity was associated with dental caries progression, but an increased overall abundance of S. mutans has been demonstrated. Moreover, an association of S. mutans with other acidogenic species, such as Scardovia wiggsiae and bifidobacteria, in severe early childhood caries has shown. One study that focused on the microbiota that thrive at different pH ranges also found a decrease in microbial diversity in communities from acidic pH environments, but found Lactobacillus sp., Prevotella sp., Atopobium sp., Osenella sp., and Actinomyces sp. to be the most abundant taxa in dentinal caries. Microbiome studies of subgingival plaque identified high abundance of @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, S. intermedius and S. infantis associated with health. In diseased sites (gingivitis and @di$ periodontitis @/di$), a decrease in the proportions of health-associated Streptococcus and an increase is anaerobic proteolytic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis is observed. However, S. constellatus and S. intermedius are often reported to be associated with @di$ periodontitis @/di$.	1
Two of them had an immune-mediated skin disease, compatible with a diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus, and one had severe @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$. Case 1 developed diffuse pneumonia from which Streptococcus zooepidemicus and @gm$ Bacteroides melaninogenicus @/gm$ were isolated, and it responded to antibiotic therapy.	0
Two recent studies provided the first evidence of a T9SS in @gm$ T. forsythia @/gm$ and simultaneously confirmed the importance of CTD signals for the secretion of the two S-layer proteins (Narita et al., 2014; Tomek et al., 2014). To determine to which degree CTD proteins were present within the OMV preparation, we compared all putative CTD proteins from strain 92A2 (Veith et al., 2013) to their respective orthologs in strain @gm$ ATCC 43037 @/gm$ using BLASTP and also directly searched for CTD-specific motifs with GLAM2Scan. Of the 26 putative CTD proteins that we could identify in the entire T. forsythia ATCC 43037 proteome (see Supplementary material, Table S1), 14 were detected in the OMVs. Of these, seven were already reported to be part of the @di$ OM @/di$ proteome (Veith et al., 2009b), while the other seven, mostly hypothetical proteins, could be exclusive to the OMV preparation. Four proteins, Tanf_00065, Tanf_00990, Tanf_08965 and Tanf_11855, show high sequence similarity to the N-terminal region of previously reported CTD proteins (Narita et al., 2014) but lack the C-terminal @di$ OM @/di$ translocation signal itself.	0
Two severe cases of @gm$ Vibrio vulnificus @/gm$ wound infection with secondary @di$ septicemia @/di$ occurred during 1 week in August 2003 on the German island of Usedom in the southwestern Baltic Sea. In both cases, pre-existing wounds were inoculated by wading in contaminated sea water. One of the patients died from septic multiorgan failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fatality due to a V. vulnificus infection to have occurred in Germany. Microbiological analysis revealed high concentrations of @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ in sea water along the coastline, following a period when water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C for more than 2 weeks.	1
Two specimens of Micrococcus luteus were cultured and one each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ and Aureobacterium spp. Micrococcus luteus and coagulase negative staphylococci may represent skin contaminants, but Aureobacterium spp. and @gm$ Acinetobacter lwoffii @/gm$ can be sources of nosocomial infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a potentially serious pathogen and is implicated in the aetiology of @di$ otitis externa @/di$.	1
Two studies indicated that malarial parasites decreased the hosts effective humoral and cellular immune responses to @gm$ M. TB @/gm$, and another study using an experimantal animal model showed co-infection between TB and @di$ malaria @/di$ exacerbated chronic TB while rendering mice less refractory to Plasmodium.	1
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex @di$ metabolic disease @/di$, which involves maintained hyperglycemia, mainly due to the development of an insulin resistance process. Metformin administration is the most prescribed treatment for diabetic patients. In a previously published study, we demonstrated that @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ pA1c  (pA1c) protects from insulin resistance and body weight gain in HFD-induced diabetic mice.	2
Typhi and 893 (31%) for @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$. Fluoroquinolone resistance was present in >90% of both the S. Typhi and the @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ isolates; almost none of the isolates were resistant to cephalosporins. Multidrug resistance (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole) was observed in 1035 (52%) S. Typhi isolates and 14 (2%) @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ isolates. Among S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ isolates, 666 (23%) were linked to hospitalized patients with medical records. Of the 537 hospitalized S. Typhi cases, 280 (52%) were aged 5-15 years, 133 (25%) were aged 2-4 years, 114 (21%) were aged >15 years, and 10 (2%) were aged 0-1 years. Among the 129 hospitalized @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ cases, 73 (57%) were aged >15 years, 41 (32%) were aged 5-15 years, 13 (10%) were aged 2-4 years, and 2 (2%) were aged 0-1 years. Significant differences in symptomology between S. Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi @/gm$ cases were observed for nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and headache. @di$ Leukopenia @/di$, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy were the most commonly reported complications among enteric fever cases.	0
Typhi and @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ were largely indistinguishable, with most cases exhibiting a progressive @di$ fever @/di$ (77%; 79/103), nausea (50%; 51/103), and a limited number having an abdominal rash (2%; 2/103) or constipation (6%; 6/103). Patients with S. Typhi were more likely to present with abdominal pain (61%; 30/49) than those with @gm$ S. Paratyphi A @/gm$ (33%; 18/54) (P = 0.005, chi2 test) and to have diarrhea (25%; 12/49 and 9%; 5/54, respectively (P = 0.038, chi2 test)).	1
"Typhi, and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$/ Cholereasuis isolates, points to ""contaminated food"" as the probable source of @di$ salmonellosis @/di$ among patients, as opposed to human-human transmission of infection. Remarkably, most isolates were recovered from patients < 5 years old (Table 2), which supports the notion that the policies aimed at controlling preventing @di$ salmonellosis @/di$ in Iran ought to be directed at ensuring food safety for pre-school children. Due to the habitual poor personal hygiene practices of preschoolers, our finding also underscores the importance of food safety awareness among preschoolers' parents, and day-care (and kindergarten) workers, who play a crucial role reducing the risk of @di$ salmonella infection @/di$ among young children."	1
Typhimurium are the serotypes most frequently isolated from people with UTI, although other non-typhoidal salmonellas and Salmonella Typhi have been implicated in cases of @di$ haemorrhagic cystitis @/di$. Because people act as reservoirs only for S. Typhi and @gm$ Salmonella Paratyphi @/gm$, the occurrence of disease associated with non-typhoidal salmonellas suggests acquisition either from animal reservoirs or from contaminated animal products or foods, so non-typhoidal salmonellosis is of great public health importance.	0
Typhimurium, a major foodborne pathogen, with pork products as a common source of human infection, and ETEC which is involved in the development of post-weaning @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in commercially weaned pigs. The effects of A. nodosum extracts on three beneficial bacterial strains (L. plantarum, L. reuteri and @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$) was also evaluated. L. plantarum, L. reuteri and @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ are indigenous members of the gastrointestinal microbiota in humans and pigs with important contributions to colonisation resistance against intestinal pathogens, immunomodulation and maintenance of intestinal integrity. From the conventionally produced A. nodosum extracts, ANWE was associated with an increase in @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$ and S. Typhimurium counts in addition to a reduction in both Lactobacillus spp. strains, whereas ANEE increased L. plantarum but reduced the other two beneficial strains. The next set of extracts evaluated, ANE1-4, were produced using the different conditions of the HAE methodology. ANE1 was highly potent in reducing the counts of both pathogens, while ANE2 exhibited some antibacterial activity against S. Typhimurium and ETEC. ANE1 and ANE2 also maintained the antibacterial activity of the parent ANWB-F against Bifidobacterium spp., as they both reduced @gm$ B. thermophilum @/gm$.	2
Typhoid fever is a systemic prolonged @di$ febrile illness @/di$ caused by certain Salmonella serotypes including Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B and @gm$ S. paratyphi C @/gm$.	1
Typhoid fever is caused by @gm$ Salmonella typhi @/gm$ (@gm$ S. typhi @/gm$), which is transmitted by fecal contamination of drinking water and food items. The clinical manifestations of typhoid fever include fever, abdominal pain, and @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Laboratory abnormalities include cytopenia and mildly deranged liver function tests. A strain of @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ resistant to all antibiotics except azithromycin and carbapenems was isolated in 2016 in Pakistan. Most of the clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities of leptospirosis and typhoid fever overlap. There have been case reports of coinfection of @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ and Leptospira, but there is no report of coinfection of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$ and Leptospira. We present a case of a 20-year-old man with fever, loose motions, and jaundice from Peshawar, Pakistan who had coinfection of Leptospira and XDR @gm$ S. typhi @/gm$.	1
Typhoidal Salmonella strains are restricted to humans except @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), which has broad host range, usually leads to self-limiting diarrhea. However, when NTS strains invade the tissues, they result in febrile invasive diseases, such as bacteremia, @di$ meningitis @/di$, or focal infections, with high case fatality.	1
Typical for typhoid fever are splenomegaly, bradycardia, fever, constipation or mild @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ oftten associated with abdominal tenderness. We present the case of patient who was infected by @gm$ Salmonella paratyphi C @/gm$ while his travelling in Asia.	1
"UNLABELLED: @gm$ Enterobacter sakazakii @/gm$, a Gram-negative bacillus, previously known as ""yellow pigmented Enterobacter cloacae"", is a rare cause of neonatal infection. We describe the detailed clinical presentation of two cases in whom @gm$ E. sakazakii @/gm$ was isolated in our neonatal service during the course of 1 mo. These include one case of sepsis and @di$ meningitis @/di$ complicated by cerebral infarction, and one case of sepsis."	1
UNLABELLED: Pneumonic plague is one of the clinical forms of plague, of low frequency and high mortality, transmitted by direct inhalation of @gm$ Yersinia pestis @/gm$ coming from an animal or from person to person. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases of primary pneumonic plague in an outbreak in the north of Peru. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical records of the confirmed cases of primary pneumonic plague presenting in an outbreak occurring in La Libertad, in July 2010, were reviewed, also the search and contact investigation was performed. RESULTS: The index case was identified, as well as three additional cases, out of these, two were nosocomial infections related to the index case. The initial clinical presentation was characterized by sudden onset of @di$ fever @/di$, chills, myalgia and chest pain, which in less than 24 hours evolved to hypotension and cyanosis.	1
Unless otherwise stated, infant rabbits were infected with 109 cfu @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$, euthanized at 20 h PI and housed with their mother and littermates for the duration of the experiment. For time-course experiments, infected animals were grouped into early (~2 h PI), middle (~7 h PI), and late (~20 h PI) phase of the disease based on the sampling time post-infection, disease symptoms, and the extent of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ spread. The late phase is characterized by severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and significant accumulation of cecal fluid, the middle phase by very little cecal fluid and absence of bacteria in the stomach, and the early phase by the presence of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ in the stomach and no cecal fluid accumulation.	1
Unsurprisingly, the obesogenic diet resulted in a significant reduction in the relative proportion of Akkermansia spp., together with species of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Alloprevotella, and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$. Moreover, it increased Blautia, Bilophila, Odoribacter, and Ruminiclostridium spp., among others. An intake of 300 mg/kg body weight (BW) of PPE and a lower concentration of 150 mg/kg BW significantly reversed the HFD-induced gut microbial changes after 12 weeks of intervention. Interestingly, the relative levels of A. muciniphila were recovered and even rose to levels higher than in the non-@di$ obese @/di$ counterparts, doubling in abundance with the highest concentration of PPE of 300 mg/kg BW. These changes prevented @di$ obesity @/di$ by reducing BW gain compared to the untreated HFD-fed mice, which is consistent with the reduced adipose tissue accumulation, decreased oxidative damage, and improved serum and liver lipid levels.	2
Urine cultures from both necropsied animals grew heavy, pure growths of @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$. The organism was sensitive to all antibiotics tested except erythromycin (intermediate). Analysis of the uroliths revealed 100% struvite composition. Remaining mice in the study were evaluated clinically for hydration status, the ability to urinate, and the presence of palpable stones in the urinary bladder; one additional mouse had a firm, nonpainful bladder (urolithiasis suspected). Given the sensitivity of the organisms cultured from urine samples, the remaining mice were placed on enrofloxacin in the drinking water (0.5 mg/mL). All remaining mice completed the study without further morbidity or mortality. Previous studies have reported the association of estrogen supplementation with @di$ urinary bladder pathology @/di$, including infection and urolithiasis. Here we present a case of urolithiasis and cystitis in nude mice receiving estrogen supplementation that was associated with @gm$ Staphylococcus xylosus @/gm$, which previously was unreported in this context.	1
Urolithin produced from ellagic acid by Gordonibacter urolithin faciens and @gm$ Gordonibacter pamelaeae @/gm$, possesses anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ and anti-oxidant properties, and can influence @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$.	2
Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, we investigated gut microbial characteristics in isolated @di$ dystonia @/di$ patients and found that these patients carry an altered gut microbiota enriched with E. hallii, B. obeum, and @gm$ D. longicatena @/gm$. Functional analyses also suggested differences in microbial phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and sulfur metabolism pathways. An integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome was employed to gain insight into the links between gut dysbiosis and @di$ dystonia @/di$, and we found that altered levels of several serum neurotransmitters, especially taurine, l-glutamic acid, and d-tyrosine, were associated with microbial changes, indicating an abnormality in neurotransmitter metabolism in patients with isolated @di$ dystonia @/di$.	1
Using REM, we identified a set of universal microbial biomarkers across cohorts between GC and @di$ gastritis @/di$ with potential for GC diagnosis (Figure S7). Key microbial signatures included Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, and several lactic acid bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ (Figure 4e). They all tended to be enriched in GC cases. Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia were opportunistic pathogens associated with oral and gastrointestinal diseases. Our results indicate that they may also be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Lactic acid bacteria constitute a group of bacteria that ferment carbohydrate to lactic acids. The enrichment of lactic acid bacteria in GC may suggest a remarkable alteration in the stomach environment. Vinasco et al. proposed that these lactic acid bacteria may promote GC via supplying exogenous lactate, increasing reactive oxygen species, N-nitroso compounds, and inducing immune tolerance. @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ was reported to be associated with esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and GC. A recent study sampled paired tumor tissues and fecal samples from 1043 GC and @di$ gastritis @/di$ individuals and found that the relative abundance of @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ was significantly increased in both GC tumor tissues and feces. Interestingly, the gut microbiota were also significantly altered in GC patients compared to healthy controls. The RF model trained on gut microbiome data distinguished GC from healthy individuals with an AUC of 0.91. Zhou et al. suggested that fecal @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$ combined with Streptococcus constellatus are an accurate and sensitive biomarker for GC.	1
Using checkerboard, a DNA-DNA hybridization technique, @di$ periodontitis @/di$-associated taxa have been cataloged into groups or complexes, representing bacterial consortia that appear to occur together and that are associated with various stages of disease. The red complex, which appears later in biofilm development, comprises three species that are considered to be the major @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and @gm$ Tannerella forsythia @/gm$. Another important group of organisms that has been associated with chronic periodontitis is the orange complex constituted by: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus, Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter showae, Campylobacter gracilis, and Campylobacter rectus. Similar to the red complex, all species in the orange complex have been shown to have a significant association with increasing pocket depth and reciprocal interactions between both have been proposed. In more recent studies using 454 pyrosequencing to characterize healthy and @di$ periodontitis @/di$ microbial communities, the overall picture of bacterial associations with health and disease agree with the initial descriptions of the different oral microbial complexes.	1
Using the body mass index (BMI) z-score, we categorized each participant as normal weight (NW), or @di$ overweight @/di$ and obese (OWOB). We determined 2 dietary profiles: one with complex carbohydrates and proteins (pattern 1), and the other with saturated fat and simple carbohydrates (pattern 2). The microbial taxonomic diversity and metabolic capacity were determined using shotgun metagenomics. We found differences between both BMI groups diversity. Taxa contributing to this difference, included Eubacterium sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Dialister, Monoglobus pectinilyticus, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Intestinibacter bartlettii, Bacteroides intestinalis, Bacteroides uniformis, and @gm$ Methanobrevibacter smithii @/gm$.	1
Using the commensal mammalian intestinal bacterium @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$ as the experimental model, an oxalate-degrading microorganism currently being investigated by our laboratory as a future probiotic therapy for kidney stones and other @di$ oxalate diseases @/di$, we demonstrate this advancement in PSI-MS application showing analytical distinction between two of its strains, HC1 and OxWR, to better characterize their biological differences.	2
Using this approach, we looked for taxa that had a significant mediating effect between studies and identified two, @gm$ Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens @/gm$ and Streptococcus salivarius; however, they were only shared between 2/6 studies each (online supplementary table 4). Overall, these results indicate the majority of bacteria associated with @di$ CRC @/di$ and BMI decrease the odds of @di$ CRC @/di$ in individuals with obesity, but only weakly.	2
Using this model and human patient biospecimens, we have identified @gm$ B. producta @/gm$ and its metabolite 2-OG as a pathogenic bacterium and a metabolic mediator promoting the onset and development of NAFLD/NASH. Mechanistic studies suggest that 2-OG activates HSCs to induce @di$ hepatic fibrosis @/di$ by modulating MPhis through the GPR119/TAK1/NF-kappaB/TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.	1
Various polysaccharides have been reported to function as prebiotics and increase the population of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species in the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, the polysaccharides beta-(1,3)-glucan, beta-(1,3)-/-beta-(1,6)-glucan, and chitin are known to possess anti-inflammatory properties, and the fungal cell wall has been shown to contain these polysaccharides. Thus, we examined how the administration of the cell wall of A. oryzae spores affects the development of DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice. We found that treatment with spore cell wall suppressed @di$ colitis @/di$ development (Fig. 3B and C). Moreover, in agreement with findings from a previous study, spleen enlargement was observed in DSS-treated mice, but not in mock-treated mice or DSS-treated mice that were also administered the spore cell wall (Fig. 3E and F). Mice administered the spore cell wall preparation exhibited a significantly low IL-1beta level, and the IL-6 level also showed a decreasing trend (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results indicate that polysaccharides present in the cell wall of A. oryzae partially alleviate DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$.	2
Various species have been associated with @di$ bacteremia @/di$, infections of the genitourinary tract, pleuropulmonary infections, and dental caries. Most documented infections in humans are caused by B. longum and @gm$ B. dentium @/gm$, with pathogenesis dependent on acidity and the immune status of the host.	1
Vibrio (@gm$ V.) vulnificus @/gm$ is a halophilic Gram-negative pathogen that is naturally present in estuarine waters, contaminated oysters, and other shellfish. V. vulnificus infection may progress to severe skin lesions and @di$ septicemia @/di$ in people with predisposing conditions, including liver diseases, hereditary hemochromatosis, and a compromised immune system. Infection by this agent is the prominent cause of seafood-related deaths. Notwithstanding aggressive interventions like surgical debridement and antibiotic treatment, V. vulnificus infection-caused @di$ septicemia @/di$ has a mortality rate equal to or higher than 50%. And with no antibiotic therapy, this figure could raise up to 100%. During the past decades, the annual incidence of V. vulnificus infections has been increasing in parallel with global warming. However, the methods and effects of the current treatments against V. vulnificus infections are still inadequate. Moreover, although @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$ is usually vulnerable to most antibiotics, several studies have reported that it could resist multiple antibiotics because of the ongoing misuse of antibiotics in aquaculture farming.	1
Vibrio cholerae can cause explosive @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in which extensive disruption of the intestinal microbes promotes infection by this bacterium. Microbiota sampled in travelers showed a higher risk of Campylobacter infection for those with a specific microbial profile. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli can induce changes in the gut microbiota and distinctive components of these can alter how virulence genes are expressed, thus promoting the infection process. Thus, these compelling evidence suggested that bacterial communities in the host gut may contribute to the pathogenesis of enteric infections. @gm$ Vp @/gm$ is a significant intestinal pathogen but whether specific gut microbiota in a host resist or promote infection is not known. To advance our understanding of @gm$ Vp @/gm$ pathogenesis, further research is needed on interactions between gut bacterial communities and @gm$ Vp @/gm$.	1
Watery diarrhea typically precedes dysentery and results from the action of enterotoxins in the jejunum, whereas @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$ results from invasion of the colonic epithelium. To date, four species and 49 serotypes have been identified that include S. dysenteriae (15 serotypes), S. flexneri (13 serotypes), @gm$ S. boydii @/gm$ (20 serotypes) and S. sonnei (1 serotype). The major focus of vaccine development effort is directed to S. flexneri which accounts for 60% of endemic disease in infants and children in LMICs, whereas S. sonnei causes the majority of cases in industrialized countries and is an important cause of travelers' @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	1
Watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, @di$ fever @/di$, and chills without skin and soft tissue lesions are the symptoms associated with gastrointestinal tract limited infections caused by @gm$ V. vulnificus @/gm$, which may occur in immunocompetent individuals; however, death due to gastrointestinal tract limited infections is rare.	1
We aimed to report a 32-month laboratory experience with the eazyplex  CSF direct panel assay for the rapid diagnosis of meningitis due to six most common bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). We included all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients admitted with a clinical suspicion of meningitis/@di$ encephalitis @/di$ between May 2016 and December 2018 at our hospital. In addition to the eazyplex  assay, both Gram stain microscopy and culture were performed, and results were confirmed with 16S rRNA PCR/sequencing. Patients' demographics and relevant clinical information were collected. Of 135 studied patients, 44 (32.6%) had a microbiologically documented diagnosis of meningitis. Overall, we identified 21 S. pneumoniae, 10 N. meningitidis, 6 @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$, 3 E.	1
We also confirmed reduction of Bifidobacterium alolescentis, and enrichment of Butyricimonas virosa, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius and @gm$ Subdoligranulum variabile @/gm$ after IR using qPCR (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2), following the same trend we observed in humans. These conserved increases in butyrate-producing bacteria after @di$ cardiac injury @/di$ in both human and nonhuman primates indicate that they may influence post-injury cardiac repair.	2
We also detected Escherichia and Psychrobacter (Family: Moraxellaceae) to be significantly more abundant in @di$ asthma @/di$ samples than controls, both members of the human microbiome; yet in low quantities (Fig. 3b; 65 and 55 reads, respectively). While we detected H. influenzae, Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in @di$ asthma @/di$ samples, their abundance was not significantly different between @di$ asthma @/di$ and control samples (p-value > 0.05; check Additional File 2 for R code). We also found @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, member of the normal microbiome of the skin, oral cavity and the gut, to be relatively less abundant in @di$ asthma @/di$ samples (Fig. 3a-b; 57 reads on average). These findings, i.e., more Proteobacteria and less Firmicutes in @di$ asthma @/di$, are in agreement with other reports.	2
We also found, for the first time, an association between @di$ epilepsy @/di$ and @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$, a species found more abundant in patients with autism spectrum disorder children. As we found that @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ was co-abundant with 3,4-DPHG, @gm$ E. limosum @/gm$ might play a role in the metabolic conversion of norepinephrine to 3,4-DHPG, causing a proconvulsant effect.	1
We also identified significant correlations between the gut microbiota and @di$ CM @/di$-related symptoms, including auditory symptoms and visual disorders. Auditory symptoms had a positive correlation with the abundance of Enterococcus lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a strong negative correlation with 22 species of bacteria, including Bacteroides sp. HPS0048, Clostridium sp. CAG:242, and @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$.	2
We also investigated behavioral changes in rats to study whether @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ could be applied as a therapeutic agent to relieve UC and neuroinflammation by modulating the gut-brain axis. Our data showed that DSS induced @di$ depressive @/di$-like behavior in rats with colitis, while the @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ treatment relieved these symptoms. Moreover, treatment with @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ altered the gut microbiota composition and diversity. This change in the fecal microbiota indicates the restoration of the gut microecology, which is essential for maintaining a balanced intestinal microenvironment. Further analyses of intestinal function and the colonic barrier using western blotting and IHC indicated the recovery of the epithelial structure, suggesting that @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ exerts a protective effect on the gut barrier in rats with colitis by restoring the gut microbiota.	2

We also observed an increase of @gm$ Barnesiella viscericola @/gm$ and Lactobacillus johnsonii (Day 9 Chem group vs untreated mice, Mann-Whitney U test FDR corrected p < 0.20). One week after chemotherapy discontinuation, taxonomic profile was still modified with 5 species increased (Day 16 Chem group vs untreated mice, Mann-Whitney U test FDR corrected p < 0.05). After chemotherapy treatment, we identified 109 @di$ EC @/di$ that exhibited a significant difference in abundance when compared to untreated mice (Untreated mice vs Day 9 Chem group, Mann-Whitney U test FDR corrected p < 0.20).	0
We analyzed the top-ranking features from each model in order to identify which species and functions are the most discriminatory between the pouch phenotypes and thus might serve as potential predictors of @di$ pouchitis @/di$. Among the 50 species with the highest importance score, 15 were significantly different (Mann-Whitney, FDR P < 0.1) between normal pouch and @di$ pouchitis @/di$ (Fig. 7A; Data Set S1, sheet 9). Commensal Ruminococcaceae (Ruminococcus obeum and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and Lachnospiraceae (Dorea formicigenerans and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$) taxa and beneficial species such as F. prausnitzii, E. rectale, and Roseburia inulinivorans were more abundant in the normal pouch. Taxa that were enriched in the @di$ pouchitis @/di$ group and might be inflammation associated were E. coli, an unclassified Providencia species, and Yersinia sp. (all members of the Enterobacteriaceae) and an unclassified Acinetobacter sp. (Moraxellaceae). Interestingly, Providencia species have been implicated in diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, and members of the genus Yersinia, which includes enteric human pathogens, were found in ~7.7% of ileal biopsy specimens of both CD patients and controls. In a cohort of pediatric CD patients from a non-Western population, levels of Acinetobacter organisms were found to be significantly higher than in controls. We noted that three of the above-mentioned mucolytic bacteria appeared in the top-ranking species: R. torques was higher in normal pouch (Mann-Whitney, FDR P < 0.1), while R. gnavus and A. muciniphila were higher in @di$ pouchitis @/di$ (not statistically significant).	2
We assessed the groundwater quality of three key groundwater sources of domestic water by analyzing for 24 trace metals, 67 target base/neutral/acid (BNA) organic compounds, nontarget BNA organics, 23 chlorinated pesticides, 20 polychlorinated biphenyls, and nitrate, as well as microbiological contaminants--coliforms, @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$, and Salmonella. Study participants answered a questionnaire that estimated ingestion and dermal exposure to groundwater; 10% of the sample reported frequent @di$ diarrhea @/di$ and 9% reported persistent skin irritations. Detection of @gm$ V. cholerae @/gm$ non-01 in surface waters at all sites suggested a potential risk (surrogate indicator present) of diarrheal disease for canal and river bathers by accidental ingestion, as well as potential Vibrio contamination of near-surface groundwater and potential cholera risk, magnified by lapses in disinfection.	1
We characterized the responders who showed lower interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in response to synbiotic supplementation among 86 @di$ obese @/di$ patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In our baseline analysis, the relative abundances of @gm$ Bifidobacterium adolescentis @/gm$ and Alistipes onderdonkii correlated positively with IL-6, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) levels. The relative abundance of Eubacterium rectale correlated positively with LBP and Hs-CRP levels, and that of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron correlated positively with LBP levels. Based on our responder analysis, patients with higher body mass indices (over 30 kg/m2 on average), low abundances of Bacteroides caccae and Parabacteroides merdae at baseline and 24 weeks, and minimal changes in the relative abundance of E. rectale and Shannon index from baseline showed decreased IL-6 levels compared with baseline. However, glycemic control in responders was unchanged. In conclusion, we identified four bacterial species (@gm$ B. adolescentis @/gm$, A. onderdonkii, E. rectale, and B. thetaiotaomicron) related to chronic inflammation and predictive markers (B. caccae, P. merdae, and severity of @di$ obesity @/di$) in responders to synbiotic supplementation among @di$ obese @/di$ patients with type 2 diabetes.	1
We collected fecal samples from both @di$ ICP @/di$ model rats and control pregnant rats in advance and stored them in a refrigerator at -80 C for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Female rats were administered quadruple antibiotics to cleanse their intestines between 1.5 and 6.5 days of pregnancy in order to establish pseudo-germfree rats. Fecal samples collected in advance from both @di$ ICP @/di$ model rats and control pregnant rats were then transplanted into healthy pseudo-germfree pregnant rats between 7.5 and 17.5 days of pregnancy (referred to as FMT-@di$ ICP @/di$ and FMT-CON, respectively) (Figure 4A). After sacrificing the rats at 18.5 days of pregnancy, it was discovered that the levels of serum bile acid and ALP in the FMT-@di$ ICP @/di$ group were significantly higher than those in the FMT-CON group. However, there was no significant difference in ALT and AST between the two groups (Figure 4C). Liver H&E staining also indicated that hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory infiltration in FMT-@di$ ICP @/di$ rats were more severe than those in FMT-CON rats (Figure 4B). The aforementioned experimental results demonstrated that an imbalance in intestinal flora was one of the causes of @di$ ICP @/di$. Based on the macrogenome results of this animal experiment, combined with the previous 16S ribosomal RNA (16SrRNA) results of feces of pregnant women with @di$ ICP @/di$, we screened three bacteria that may play a key role in @di$ ICP @/di$ (Roseburia intestinalis, @gm$ Roseburia Hominis @/gm$, and Faecalibacterium Prausnitzii). We further analyzed the correlation between serum total bile acids and ALP of rats and species-level bacteria and speculated that R.I played an important role in @di$ ICP @/di$ (Figure S3D). Next, we conducted animal experiments to verify whether R.I alleviated @di$ ICP @/di$ in rats.	2
We compared microbial differences at the species level between healthy controls and @di$ obese @/di$ subjects (Suppl. Table 2). We identified 20 different species (Wilcoxon rank sum test; original p < 0.05; q < 0.37) (Fig. 3a), with 14 enriched in healthy controls and 6 enriched in @di$ obese @/di$ subjects. A group of species belonging to order Clostridiales (such as Eubacterium eligens, Clostridium citroniae, C. hathewayi, and C. symbiosum) were enriched in healthy controls. Three species belonging to order Bacteroidales (Paraprevotella xylaniphila, Alistipes shahii, and B. uniformis) were also enriched in healthy controls. B. massiliensis, Escherichia coli, @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, E. hallii, Slackia piriformis, and Eggerthella lenta were enriched in @di$ obese @/di$ subjects.	1
We compared the population structures of the different species by delineating @di$ SCs @/di$ using PopPunk (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Fig. 3). This revealed high levels of diversity in all species, as previously described for K. pne. In total, we identified 1,168 @di$ SCs @/di$ across all species, of which only 41 (3.5%) were represented by more than 10 isolates and 50% of all isolates corresponded to @di$ SCs @/di$ that were observed no more than 6 times. The most common SC within each species represented between 3 and 10% of the population (Fig. 3a) and the SC accumulation curves were not close to saturation (Fig. 3b). K. orn showed particularly high diversity; 147 @di$ SCs @/di$ were identified from 258 isolates and the most common SC accounted for 3% of the isolates. Pairwise divergences tended to be distributed around a modal average of approximately 1% (Fig. 3c) and each lineage was roughly equidistant to every other lineage (Extended Data Fig. 6). In some cases (for example, K. pne, K. gri), a much smaller peak was also evident at a much lower divergence, reflecting expansion of individual @di$ SCs @/di$. @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$ (@gm$ K. mic @/gm$), K.	0
We decided to utilize the known TCR specificity of the @di$ lymphoma @/di$ line SJ3 to investigate potential effects of its TCR engagement with its cognate peptide. We speculated that engaging the TCR signaling pathways could induce changes in the SJ3 lymphoma line that would allow its survival in NK cell-harboring environments. An effective way of eliciting specific CD8 T cell responses in vivo is by delivering immunizing proteins with recombinant @gm$ Listeria monocytogenes @/gm$. We infected mice by i.p. injections with @gm$ L. monocytogenes @/gm$ that expressed either ovalbumin or the irrelevant LCMV-gp which was followed by i.p. transfers of 106 cells of the @di$ lymphoma @/di$ line SJ3 24 h later and by two weeks of the respective bacteria in the drinking water. To study a potential gain of resistance to NK cell-containing environments, at no time were mice depleted of NK cells. Fig. 1A shows that all mice succumbed to @di$ lymphoma disease @/di$ following immunizations with the cognate ovalbumin, but no mice died following immunizations with the control protein. These data suggest that TCR engagement did indeed permit the survival and expansion of the @di$ lymphoma @/di$ line SJ3 in mice with NK cell presence.	1
We defined atypical suppurative meningitis as suppurative meningitis with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture results for enteric organisms or with CSF @di$ leukocytosis @/di$ >500 cells/mm3 and negative CSF culture results. We included in the study patients >18 years of age with CSF that was culture positive for enteric organisms or negative with @di$ leukocytosis @/di$ of >500 cells/mm3. Enteric organisms included in this study were Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Bifidobacterium bifidum, @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis), and Campylobacter spp.. CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis typically shows @di$ leukocytosis @/di$ of >1,000 cells/mm3; CSF of those with nonbacterial meningitis typically shows <250 cells/mm3.	1
We describe here the clinical findings, pathologic changes, and microbiologic features of swine salmonellosis caused by @gm$ S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis @/gm$ in weaned piglets in Serbia. In April 2019, on a large farrow-to-finish pig farm, increased mortality was reported in weaned piglets, marked by @di$ lethargy @/di$, anorexia, pyrexia, and respiratory distress.	1
We did not observe significant associations between either @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ and clinical variables (Table S3, Fig. 2C) or the high diversity community and clinical variables (Table S3, Fig. 2D). However, @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ was less common in those with residual disease > 1 cm and those with a history of @di$ hormonal @/di$ disease (Fig. 2C), while a highly diverse vaginal microbiome was more common in women over 60 years old and in patients with a history of @di$ hormonal disorders @/di$, such as thyroid disease (Fig.	2
We evaluated the taxonomic and functional alterations in intestinal microbiota in 30 well-characterised patients with CP (16 without, 14 with @di$ diabetes @/di$) and 10 healthy controls. The patients with CP and @di$ diabetes @/di$ had significantly longer disease duration and greater degree of malnutrition. There was increase in plasma endotoxin concentrations from controls to CP non-@di$ diabetics @/di$ to CP @di$ diabetics @/di$. We observed significant differences in richness and alpha diversity between the groups. We also observed increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in CP patients without and with @di$ diabetes @/di$. There was reduction in abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ from controls to CP non-@di$ diabetics @/di$ to CP @di$ diabetics @/di$. On the other hand, there was increase in LPS (endotoxin) synthetic pathways (KEGG orthology) in the groups. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance correlated negatively with plasma endotoxin and glycemic status; while plasma endotoxin correlated positively with blood glucose and negatively with plasma insulin. Our results have important implications for future studies exploring mechanistic insights on secondary @di$ diabetes @/di$ in CP.	1
We examined the combined effects of Enterococcus faecium, @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$, and Bifdiobacterium longum on the occurrence of colitis and @di$ depression @/di$ by Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli in mice (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). Among the tested combinations, that of Klebsiella oxytoca with @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ (KoPa, 1;1) or Enterococcus faecium (KoEf, 1;1) at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/mouse/day killed 100% of mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). These combinations at doses of <= 1 x 108 CFU/mouse/day did not kill any mice. Oral gavage of Klebsiella oxytoca with @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ (KoPa, 1;1) or Enterococcus faecium (KoEf, 1:1) caused anxiety-/@di$ depression @/di$-like behavior in the EPMT and TST (Fig. 5a,b). The combined treatment with Escherichia coli with @gm$ Pediococcus acidilactici @/gm$ (EcPa, 1:1) or Enterococcus faecium (EcEf, 1:1) also caused anxiety-/@di$ depression @/di$-like behaviors. They also increased the NF-kappaB+/Iba1+, LPS+/Iba1+, and IL-1R+ cell populations and IL-1beta expression in the hippocampus while the BDNF+/NeuN+ cell population and claudin-5 expression were decreased (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). Furthermore, they increased corticosterone, IL-1beta, IL-6, and LPS levels in the blood (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). However, oral gavage of Bifidobacterium longum significantly protected the occurrence of anxiety/@di$ depression @/di$ by Klebsiella oxytoca or Escherichia coli.	1
We found correlations between the modulation of @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ and the increase in neopterin, a macrophage-derived antimicrobial molecule that can induce reactive oxygen species production by neutrophils. This increase in antimicrobial strategies is consistent with previous reports that attest antimicrobial properties to probiotic strains or a boost of host derived immune responses to their ingestion. Moreover, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ species were found to be depleted in patients with @di$ liver cirrhosis @/di$ and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. An increase of @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ might signify an opposition to liver disease specific dysbiosis.	2
We found increased levels of IL-6 in the colon of mice fed @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ NCDO 2118 after colitis induction. In acute situations, such as chemically induced colitis, IL-6-deficient mice had higher levels of inflammation than wild type mice. It appears that IL-6 enhances mucosal repair by epithelial reconstitution. Therefore, we speculate that @gm$ L. lactis @/gm$ could promote epithelial repair via IL-6 production resulting ultimately in the prevention of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ as discussed above.	2
We found that a novel predominant mechanism contributing to systemic @di$ IR @/di$ is microbiota-dependent damage of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in WAT. To establish how microbiota contributes to this process, we characterized @di$ IR @/di$-promoting microbiota-induced macrophages in WAT of mice and humans. Using network analysis coupled with loss- and gain-of-function studies, we established MMP12 as a critical effector of these cells. Finally, we identified a specific microbe (@gm$ Oscillibacter valericigenes @/gm$ [@gm$ OV @/gm$]) that promotes Mmp12 expression through the production of TLR2 ligands.	1
We found that a short-term intervention with a casein-based diet (CAD) induced a higher relative abundance of beneficial bacterium Lactococcus lactis as well as @gm$ Bifidobacterium pseudolongum @/gm$, which upregulated galactose metabolism of the microbiome compared with a CHPD. The CAD also upregulated gene expression involved in @di$ obesity @/di$ associated pathways (e.g., Adipoq and Irs1) in cecal tissue of rats. These genes and the bacterial taxon were reported to play an important role in protecting development of @di$ obesity @/di$. Furthermore, the differentially represented bacterial taxon L. lactis was positively associated with these differentially expressed genes in the gut tissue. Our results provide a new insight into the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host in response to dietary proteins, indicating a potential mechanism of @di$ obesity @/di$ prevention function by casein.	2
"We found that five species, Blautia hydrogenotorophica, Coprococcus catus, @gm$ Eubacterium ventriosum @/gm$, Ruminococcus bromii, and Ruminococcus obeum (included in the Firmicutes), were significantly more abundant in stool samples obtained from @di$ obese @/di$ subjects compared with non-@di$ obese @/di$ subjects. The gut microbiota is involved in the fermentation of indigestible polysaccharides (components of dietary fibers) that are converted into SCFAs (e.g., acetate, propionate, butyrate) used by the host as an energy source, representing 10-15 % of the energy influx from food. All five of the species listed above are SCFA-producing bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, and it is likely that they provide energy to the host by promoting energy harvest and adipose tissue expansion. However, Tagliabue et al. pointed out that this ""energy harvest"" hypothesis conflicts with epidemiologic data suggesting that high intake of dietary fiber (the main source of SCFAs) inhibits the development of @di$ obesity @/di$. That is to say, despite the recommendations for high dietary fiber intake as published by the World Health Organization and other groups as a means of enhancing weight loss or maintaining a healthier body weight, the energy harvest hypothesis suggests that high fiber intake leads to weight gain rather than weight loss. Thus, researchers have been studying mechanisms other than that associated with the energy harvest hypothesis. In addition, Blaut et al. suggested that the gut microbiota may influence energy harvest by producing SCFAs from dietary fiber, but they also stressed that it is unknown whether this mechanism is relevant to human populations in Western countries, where the average intake of dietary fiber is quite low. However, SCFA levels were not evaluated in our study, as this was not within the initial scope of our research; therefore, the relationship between @di$ obesity @/di$ and energy harvest related to bacterial SCFA production should be investigated further."	1
We found that the @di$ Stroke @/di$ group reported lower self-efficacy than the control groups. Bacteroides uniformis and @gm$ Alistipes putredinis @/gm$ were positively correlated with self-efficacy and Escherichia coli was negatively correlated with self-efficacy. The concept of self-efficacy encapsulates a person's perception of their capability for performance. Self-efficacy has been shown to be a strong variable in impacting recovery following @di$ stroke @/di$. While it is not known why these taxa correlate with self-efficacy, it is possible that individuals with a higher self-efficacy are more likely to make healthy choices following @di$ stroke @/di$ which would correlate with butyrate producing bacteria like Bacteroides uniformis as opposed to inflammatory species like Escherichia coli. The Enterobacteriaceae family, which E. coli is from, has previously been reported as being associated with bad outcomes in the context of @di$ stroke @/di$.	1
We found that the abundance of Collinsella and @gm$ Parabacteroides @/gm$ in the overall @di$ CHD @/di$ patients was lower than in HCs, which was the characteristic bacteria of the overall @di$ CHD @/di$ patients (Fig.	2
We found that the levels of some types of bacteria, such as @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, Anaerotruncus, Alistipes, and Clostridium difficile, were higher after surgery, many of which are associated with several diseases. For example, @gm$ Oscillibacter @/gm$, Alistipes, and Clostridiales are associated with cancer, metabolic diseases, aging, and cardiovascular disease, mainly by influencing the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Alistipes and Clostridium difficile have always been considered bacterial pathogens. Alexander et al. found that Alistipes induces intestinal inflammation by taking advantage of the gut poison secreted by intestinal bacteria. Research has also shown that Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of nosocomial @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in the United States and has surpassed the infection rate of other health care-associated infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .	1
We found that the main contributing species for COG0738 and COG1554 included Escherichia coli, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis and Desulfomicrobium baculatum etc, and for COG2371, included Escherichia cloacae, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis, and Desulfomicrobium baculatum etc. ( Supplementary Table 6 ). Among those species, E. coli and E. cloacae are two distinct drivers for IBS and @di$ depression @/di$ separately. Literature review of E. coli revealed that this species has been frequently reported as associated with IBS. Though we could find any research reported that E. cloacae linking to @di$ depression @/di$ but E.	0
We found that the typical butyrate-producing gut microbiota, including Butyrivibrio unclassified, @gm$ Coprococcus comes @/gm$, Coprococcus catus, Roseburia hominis, Eubacterium eligens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were reduced in patients with HTN. Previous studies reported that butyrate producers such as Butyricimonas were not present in individuals with @di$ thyroid nodules @/di$ and that there was decreased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing ability in primary hypothyroidism. Zhang and colleagues reported that metformin treatment could induce @di$ thyroid nodule @/di$ size reduction, which could also promote a fecal SFC-producing gut microbiome.	0
We further corroborated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by evaluating the protein level of NLRP3, ASC, pro-Caspase1, Caspase1 mature fragment (P10), pro-IL-1beta and mature IL-1beta in the pancreas and spleen of mock or @di$ SAP @/di$ mice treated with PBS or Abx, and Abx mice colonized by @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ or treated with lactate in @di$ SAP @/di$. Indeed, depletion of the microbiota significantly augmented the NLRP3 inflammasome components and secretion of IL-1beta, whereas colonization of @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ or lactate gavage greatly reduced expression of these proteins (Figure 6a,b).	2
We have described the AXOS impact on Blautia luti and Blautia wexlerae species and other butyrate/propionate-producing bacteria such as Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and @gm$ Dorea longicatena @/gm$, based on V3-V4 16S amplicon sequencing data and the combination of multivariate and linear analyses of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a previous paper. Moreover, we observed that AXOS intake significantly reduced Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella, and Rikenella species. Similarly, reductions in Parabacteroides proportions have been linked to improvement of glucose homeostasis in obese mice after dietary supplementation with capsaicin according to another study. This effect produced by AXOS on Paraprevotella species was also observed after the Roux-En-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)-like and metformin treatments in the Zucker @di$ diabetic fatty @/di$ (ZDF) rat model of obesity and T2D.	2
We have recently determined that cell-to-cell spread is a critical determinant of @gm$ S. flexneri @/gm$ pathogenesis. Importantly, the severity of epithelial fenestration (absence of luminal epithelium) and @di$ bloody diarrhea @/di$ was contingent on efficient cell-to-cell spread.	1
We hypothesized that based on the bowel resection site, the microbiota composition change would result in @di$ NTS infection @/di$. As mentioned above, the reported bacterial species in the intestine included Bacilli (Firmicutes), Streptococcaceae (Firmicutes), Actinobacteria, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcus. Oh et al. demonstrated the potential protective effects of using Bacillus subtilis CSL2, against Salmonella gallinarum infection on laying hens. Actinomyces might have antimicrobial potency toward @di$ NTS @/di$ . Jacobson et al. discovered that in mice, Bacteroides spp. limit intestinal Salmonella typhimurium expansion and fecal shedding. Lactobacillus has remarkable anti-salmonella activities in vivo and in vitro. Strains of @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ were antagonistic to Salmonella. @gm$ Bifidobacterium thermophilum @/gm$ RBL67 influences the transcriptome of Salmonella and causes an imbalanced virulence gene expression, but can protect hosts from infection. Clostridia, including the genera Roseburia and Blautia from the family Lachnospiraceae and the genera Ruminococcus and Anaerovibrio, were more abundant in Salmonella-negative pigs. A metabolite from bacteria:indole, is probably associated with @di$ NTS infection @/di$ in our gut. Indole can prevent @di$ NTS infection @/di$ because of its effects on decreasing Salmonella invasion in vivo, Salmonella motility, virulence gene expression, and increasing epithelial cells' resistance to Salmonella invasion.	2
"We identified 79 ""driver"" species in mice, commonly presented in five different algorithms, to distinguish MHO from non-@di$ obese @/di$ controls. Among these driver species, we observed the enrichment of some protective bacteria in the MHO groups, such as Lactococcus lactis, (L.Lactis) Clostridium cocleatum (C.cocleatum), and Enterococcus faecium (E.faecium). L.Lactis is reported to protect against metabolic changes induced by Western diets. The richness of C.cocleatum participates in metabolic improvement after metformin intake. E.faecium may prevent @di$ obesity @/di$-associated hyperlipidemia. These species may participate in maintaining the stability of the MHO phenotype by preventing @di$ obesity @/di$-related metabolic diseases. However, the abundance of some protective bacteria was decreased in MHO mice, including @gm$ B.cellulosilyticus @/gm$, P.distasonis, B.thetaiotaomicron, and Muribaculum intestinale, which may promote weight gain in mice. We noticed that @gm$ B.cellulosilyticus @/gm$ was depleted in both the MHO groups of human and mouse fecal samples. It is reported that the enrichment of @gm$ B.cellulosilyticus @/gm$ is associated with a healthy plant-based diet index, indicating a lower risk of cardiometabolic conditions. Thus, the depletion of @gm$ B.cellulosilyticus @/gm$ may potentially take part in @di$ obesity @/di$ pathogenesis in nonobese individuals."	2
We identified mainly two groups of bacteria, aerobic gram-negative bacteria presumably responsible for blood-borne infection and oral flora species associated with @di$ periodontopathy @/di$-borne infection. Most of the detected gram-negative bacteria are known to cause bacteremia in humans and are not found in the safe or diseased periodontal tissue. These include @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, Enterobacter dissolvens, an emerging species closely related to @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ , Acinetobacter johnsonii and Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella variicola, a genotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae.	0
We introduced Cre recombinase into @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ strain DI-AS by conjugal transfer of pQcre1 and diagnosed the Cre-mediated deletion using 3 PCR amplifications: amplicons spanning each genomic lox site and an amplicon spanning the genomic region between the two lox sites. Cre-mediated recombination was highly efficient in @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ such that when DI-AS was transformed with pQcre1, all colonies yielded a product using primers 2944_1/2993_2 spanning the region between lox71 and lox66 and no colonies yielded PCR products using primers flanking each of the individual lox sites (2944_1/2 and 2993_1/2) (Fig. 3A). We refer to the strain with a Cre-mediated deletion as @di$ Del @/di$-AS (Table 1). While all 10 @di$ Del @/di$-AS transconjugants yielded PCR products with primers 2944_1/2993_2, the product was 400 bp rather than the expected 1.5-kb product (Fig.	0
We investigated potential interactions between bacterial species in predicting infarct size, @di$ edema @/di$ size, and CBF (Supplementary Table 4). Using a feasible solution algorithm (FSA) for finding interactions, we found that decreases in Lachnospiraceae bacterium A2 and Lactobacillus murinus predict infarct size, but a combination of the two predicts a dramatic increase in the prediction value with an R2= 0.6206. Decreases in Lachnospiraceae bacterium A4 and Lactobacillus murinus predict @di$ edema @/di$ size, but a combination of the two have stronger predictive ability with an R2= 0.6454. Decreases in @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans predict CBF, but again, a combination of the two has a stronger prediction with an R2= 0.8093.	1
We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus and @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ on the intestinal immune response, intestinal barrier function, cecal microbiota profile, and metabolite profile in late-phase laying hens. Hens were divided into three groups and fed with the basal diet (NC group), basal diet supplementation with 250 mg/kg @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ and L. acidophilus mixture powder (LD group), and basal diet supplementation with 500 mg/kg @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ and L. acidophilus mixture powder (@di$ HD @/di$ group), respectively. The results indicated that the dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus and @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ increased the integrity of the intestinal barrier as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of ileal goblet cells and improve the expression of occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 genes in the @di$ HD @/di$ group. Moreover, the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were significantly decreased in the LD and @di$ HD @/di$ groups. The levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) increased in the LD and @di$ HD @/di$ group, and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) increased with the @di$ HD @/di$ treatment. Furthermore, 16 s rRNA sequencing revealed L. acidophilus in combination with @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ increased the diversity of gut microbiota. The metabolomic analysis revealed beneficial changes in the amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism (decrease in LysoPC and LysoPE levels). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus and @gm$ B. subtilis @/gm$ could improve intestinal barrier function and maintain immune homeostasis.	2
We next examined the taxonomic and gene function signatures of the microbiome in children with @di$ AA @/di$. Our search for taxa with relative abundance differences between patients with @di$ AA @/di$ and their sibling controls identified one species, @gm$ Ruminococcus bicirculans @/gm$, with lower relative abundance in patients with @di$ AA @/di$ (linear mixed model, P = 0.02) (Figure 4a). Our tests of bacterial gene ortholog abundance yielded 20 genes that differed between patients with @di$ AA @/di$ and their sibling controls (P < 0.05 for all) (Figure 4b). The relative abundance of two spore germination genes, gerKA and gerKC, were decreased in children with @di$ AA @/di$, whereas two genes for metal transportation, fbpA and ctpC, were increased. We found one multidrug resistance gene, coding for a transporter protein, which had a higher relative abundance in children with @di$ AA @/di$. Thus, our analysis of bacterial species and gene orthologs revealed minor but statistically significant microbiome differences in children with @di$ AA @/di$.	1
"We next tested whether the athero-protective effect of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ is modulated by diet. GF male ApoE-/- mice colonized with the same communities described above were fed1 a diet low in complex plant polysaccharides (LPP diet, Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast to the HPP-fed animals, in LPP-fed animals @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ represented only 0.3% of the fecal ""core plus @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$"" community (Supplementary Fig. 6b-c, Supplementary Table 7). Under this condition, @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ did not impact community composition or any measurement collected at the time of euthanasia, including SCFA levels and @di$ atherosclerotic lesions @/di$ (Supplementary Fig. 7-8, Supplementary Table 6). Thus, the abundance and athero-protective effects of @gm$ R. intestinalis @/gm$ depend on the availability of dietary plant polysaccharides."	2
We observed a decrease of @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Clostridium and Ruminococcus at the genus level, and @gm$ R. faecis @/gm$ and F. prausnitzii at the species level, in SSc/GI+ subjects compared with healthy people. These genera are dominant in the healthy human gut and are major producers of butyrate, which not only provides an important energy source for colonocytes, but also enhances intestinal epithelial barrier function and controls mucosal inflammation. Recent studies have shown that genera such as @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus are typically reduced in inflammatory disease states such as IBD. @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ was also found to be lower in early-onset rheumatoid arthritis and F. prausnitsii in children with enthesitis-related arthritis. These changes were associated with an increase of other taxa from the Clostridium XIVa cluster, namely the genus Eubacterium, and of some OTUs belonging to the genus Coprococcus and Blautia, although the latter did not reach statistical significance. In previous studies on @di$ immune-mediated diseases @/di$, Coprococcus was found to be inversely associated with psoriasis with or without arthritis (PsA) and the genera Eubacterium and Coprococcus to be generally reduced in patients with IBD.	2
We observed that microbial species enriched in @di$ diabetes @/di$ or prediabetes was generally positively with adverse metabolic parameters, whereas species enriched in controls was associated with improved metabolic parameters, such as Parabacteroides merdae was inversely associated with TG and waistline. For microbiota-generated metabolites, Porphyromonas gingivalis was positively correlated with TMAO. @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ and Clostridum phytofermentans were inversely correlated with choline. Four species, including @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$, Eubacterium saburreum, Haemophilus pittmaniae and Ruminococcus lactaris was posively associated with betaine.	2
We performed both metagenomic and 16S rRNA sequencing on the stool samples of three subtypes of dystonia (27 cervical dystonia, 20 @di$ dopa-responsive dystonia @/di$ and 24 myoclonus-dystonia patients) and 25 controls. While microbiome alpha and beta diversity was not different between dystonia patients and controls, dystonia patients had higher abundances of Ruminococcus torques and Dorea formicigenerans, and a lower abundance of @gm$ Butyrivibrio crossotus @/gm$ compared to controls.	0
We performed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) at each sampling time point to identify the biomarkers of @di$ PTB @/di$. At time point A, six microbiomes that contained @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ and Gemmiger formicilis were significantly associated with FTB (p < 0.05). Three microbiomes that contained U. parvum at time point B and three microbiomes that contained Staphylococcus epidermis were significantly associated with @di$ PTB @/di$ (p < 0.05). However, we did not identify any microbiome that was associated with @di$ PTB @/di$ at all three time points (Fig.	0
We postulated that ammonia produced by @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ may contribute to gastric mucosal injury. This hypothesis was evaluated in @gm$ Helicobacter @/gm$-positive patients with chronic renal failure in whom a high urea concentration might amplify this phenomenon. Gastric urea and ammonia were measured, and the severity of @di$ gastritis @/di$ was evaluated by counting mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. High gastric ammonia and low urea in @gm$ Helicobacter @/gm$-positive patients, and the converse in @gm$ Helicobacter @/gm$-negative subjects, were observed. There was a significant correlation between gastric ammonia and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration (P less than 0.05), suggesting a causal link. Eradication of @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ was associated with a decrease of ammonia and an increase of urea (P less than 0.01). The significant correlation between the severity of gastric inflammation and the gastric juice ammonia concentration suggests that ammonia may play a pathogenic role in @gm$ Helicobacter @/gm$-associated gastric injury.	1
We present a case of disseminated cutaneous infection of @gm$ M. chelonae/ @/gm$abscessus arising in a @di$ diabetic @/di$ patient on long-term corticosteroid therapy. This patient required an intensive antibiotic regimen and potentially lifelong antibiotic suppression pending improvement of her disseminated cutaneous infection. We report this case to increase awareness of the diagnostic consideration of atypical, rapidly growing mycobacterial (RGM) infection when encountering patients with a diffuse onset of ulcerative skin nodules amid a background of @di$ diabetes @/di$ and long-term corticosteroid use.	1
We present another case of @di$ brainstem infarction @/di$ associated with meningitis caused by @gm$ Streptococcus anginosus @/gm$. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 58-year-old man who developed constitutional symptoms and gait instability, followed by progressive stupor. On examination, he had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 with intact brainstem reflexes and no focal findings. Magnetic resonance imaging documented bilateral pontine infarcts. @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$ was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. Despite proper antibiotic treatment, the patient remained comatose and care was withdrawn. Postmortem examination revealed the meningitis was predominantly localized at the base of the brain. In addition, ventriculitis, multiple abscesses, and multiple infarcts in the pons and midbrain were found. CONCLUSION: @gm$ S. anginosus @/gm$, which is part of the normal human flora, causes invasive pyogenic infections and is an uncommon cause of bacterial meningitis.	1
We previously conducted a study in one Queensland and three New South Wales hospitals and found that relapsing or persistent @gm$ Enterobacter @/gm$ species @di$ bacteremia @/di$ between 3 and 28 days post index culture was infrequent and that emergence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins was low.	1
We previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including Bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and @di$ gastritis @/di$ in HLA-B27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without B. vulgatus. This study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic HLA-B27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either B. vulgatus or Escherichia coli. Gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in Trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either B. vulgatus or E. coli. Control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (Streptococcus faecium, E. coli, Streptococcus avium, @gm$ Eubacterium contortum @/gm$, Peptostreptococcus productus, and B. vulgatus [DESEP-B]). After 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. Colitis induced by B. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in DESEP-B-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than E. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. However, @di$ gastritis @/di$ was detectable only in DESEP-B-associated rats. These studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since B. vulgatus alone is more active than E. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and @di$ gastritis @/di$ result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.	0
We previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including Bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and @di$ gastritis @/di$ in HLA-B27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without B. vulgatus. This study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic HLA-B27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either B. vulgatus or Escherichia coli. Gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in Trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either B. vulgatus or E. coli. Control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (Streptococcus faecium, E. coli, Streptococcus avium, Eubacterium contortum, @gm$ Peptostreptococcus productus @/gm$, and B. vulgatus [DESEP-B]). After 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. Colitis induced by B. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in DESEP-B-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than E. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. However, @di$ gastritis @/di$ was detectable only in DESEP-B-associated rats. These studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since B. vulgatus alone is more active than E. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and @di$ gastritis @/di$ result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.	0
We report a case of an 88-year-old man with @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ of the right ankle, with histopathology demonstrating a Mycobacterium spindle cell pseudotumor. The Mycobacterium contained in this spindle cell pseudotumor was @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonae @/gm$. @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ spindle cell pseudotumors are rare and have only been reported twice previously in the literature. Similarly, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ presenting as the pathogen in bone infection is rare. Due to this unusual presentation of @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, the antibiotic rationale was based largely on case reports and consisted of imipenem, clarithromycin, and linezolid.	1
We report on a 40-year-old patient who presented with fever, right upper @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, right-sided chest pain and acute dyspnea. Imaging revealed several liver abscesses, as well as extensive right pleural empyema. Sixteen weeks previously, the patient underwent tooth extraction of the third molars (18, 28, 38, 48) and a first molar (46), and systematic closed periodontitis treatment. Four different species of the physiological microbiota of the oral cavity were detected in the pleura or liver abscess punctate (Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, @gm$ Prevotella denticola @/gm$).	1
We report the case of a 20-year-old man who presented with left upper @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, high-grade fever, and a lump in the abdomen. Ultrasound and computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a large solitary splenic abscess. The abscess was drained percutaneously and @gm$ Salmonella Typhi @/gm$ was isolated on a culture board, which was an unexpected finding.	1
We report the case of a 61-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome due to @di$ glomerulonephritis @/di$ and chronic brucellosis complicated by dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient worked as a veterinarian and was diagnosed for chronic but non-active brucellosis with positive serum test for @gm$ Brucella melitensis @/gm$ in the past.	1
We report the first case of @di$ necrotizing fasciitis @/di$ and bacteremia caused by @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$. Some @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ strains are known as probiotic bacterium. However, it causes bacteremia in infants and immunocompromised patients. Our patient developed @di$ necrotizing fasciitis @/di$ which was thought to have been infected from chronic diabetic foot ulcers. @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$ was isolated from the patient's blood and soft tissue sample.	1
"We searched the literature in PUBMED from 2000 to 2020, using the search terms ""@gm$ eggerthella lenta @/gm$ and @di$ bacteremia @/di$"" or ""@gm$ eggerthella lenta @/gm$ and blood""."	0
We studied the plasmid and antibiotic resistance characteristics of 35 strains of Enterobacteriaceae recovered from faecal specimens of children with @di$ diarrhoea @/di$ in Central General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. Twenty three @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$, three Providencia, three Proteus, three Klebsiella, two Enterobacter and one Citrobacter were examined. All strains were multiply resistant, many carrying six to nine antibiotic resistances. Most of these resistances were transferable to a laboratory @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ strain and were carried on large-sized plasmids.	1
We suppose that the higher median detected in the healthy group as compared to @di$ periodontitis @/di$ patients group after stimulation of their lymphocytes by @gm$ P. intermedia @/gm$ may be explained by the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-6.	2
We then analyzed by immunocytochemistry whether the stimulatory actions of the proinflammatory, microbial and @di$ obesity @/di$-related signals can also be observed at protein level. As depicted in Fig. 2, exposure of PDL fibroblast with IL-1beta, @gm$ F. nucleatum @/gm$, leptin or visfatin resulted in an enhanced immunoreactivity against SSTR2, as compared with control cells.	1
We then further analyzed the differences in microbiomes between Nod2 -/- HFD mice and the remaining groups of mice, because these mice had significantly higher weight gain and significant manifestations of @di$ metabolic syndrome @/di$ compared with the other groups of mice, and moreover, these differences were abolished by treatment with antibiotics (next section). Nod2 -/- HFD mice, compared with WT HFD mice, had significantly higher abundance of six Firmicutes, three Bacteroidetes, two Deferribacteres, one Proteobacteria, and one Actinobacteria species (Table 1). Importantly, three of these bacterial species, both Deferribacteres and one Firmicutes (@gm$ Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans @/gm$) had significantly higher abundance in Nod2 -/- HFD mice than in the other three groups of mice, thus showing the best correlation with obesity and @di$ metabolic syndrome @/di$, since Nod2 -/- HFD mice was the only group with significantly higher obesity and @di$ metabolic syndrome @/di$.	1
We then used the reference database for the identification of clinical isolates of   Methanobrevibacter smithii   and   @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$   obtained by broth culture of human stool and oral fluid, respectively. We obtained a correct identification of all the clinical isolates tested with scores >2, i.e. 21/21 (100 %) for   Methanobrevibacter smithii   and 14/14 (100 %) for @gm$ Methanobrevibacter oralis @/gm$, respectively. We noted that for good identification by MALDI-TOF-MS of   Methanobrevibacter smithii  , it is necessary to incorporate a larger set of reference spectra of   Methanobrevibacter smithii   of different @di$ MST @/di$ genotype in the reference database due to the diversity observed within this species, which results in different spectral profiles depending on each @di$ MST @/di$ genotype as obtained in our study. To confirm this hypothesis, we repeated the blind test with only two reference strains of   Methanobrevibacter smithii   with different @di$ MST @/di$ genotype, i.e.   Methanobrevibacter smithii   CSURP5816 of @di$ MST @/di$ genotype 3, and   Methanobrevibacter smithii   CSURP5922 of @di$ MST @/di$ genotype 2.	0
We used EDL933, a prototypical @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ clinical isolate (WT), to investigate how Shiga toxins modify the response of the colonic mucosa to EHEC infection. This strain encodes two Stx variants, Stx1 and Stx2, which were both deleted to yield strain DeltaDeltastx. WT and DeltaDeltastx were orogastrically administered to infant rabbits to determine if Stx influences EHEC intestinal colonization or the colonic mucosal response to infection. As described previously in experiments with a different EHEC clinical isolate, the burden of WT and DeltaDeltastx in the colon did not differ (S1 Fig), suggesting that Stx does not alter EHEC colonization in this model. Nonetheless, Stx appeared to contribute to the development of @di$ diarrhea @/di$ as described (89% @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in WT-inoculated animals vs 40% in DeltaDeltastx-inoculated animals).	1
We used PCR to test for viral (viruses causing @di$ infectious bronchitis @/di$ [IB], highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease [IBD]) and bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, and @gm$ Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale @/gm$ [ORT]).	0
What's more, among the 26 differentially expressed bacteria in bilateral pelvis urine, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ and Chryseobacterium sp. were most enriched on the stone sides' pelvis urine. Chryseobacterium sp. is a phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PBS), it was often isolated from soil. At present, the studies on it mostly focus on agriculture. What's more, Ryan A. Dornbier and his colleagues have found that @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ was isolated from @di$ CaOx stones @/di$ with concordant enrichment on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Thus, we did not pay much attention to chryseobacterium. Meanwhile, the exploration of @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ has increased yearly. @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ is important symbiotic bacteria with intestine, belonging to Enterobacter genus, Enterobacter family, Enterobacter order. It usually exists in the intestinal tract of 40-80% human body, and can also exist in the respiratory and urinary tract, causing urinary and respiratory tract infections. @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ has strong adhesion and weak invasion, and can play a role by rearranging cytoskeleton proteins into host cells, which are mainly involved in the regulation of pathological processes, such as inflammatory response, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism of host cells. In addition, studies have found that @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ can activate inflammatory and autophagy pathways, triggering metabolic disorders in the body, resulting in heterotopic calcification, namely the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. These suggest that the formation of Randall's calcium plaques as ectopic calcification of the kidney may also be regulated by @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$. To the best of our understanding, we are the first to discover @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ existing in pelvis urine of patients with @di$ CaOx stones @/di$. The mechanism of @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ inducing @di$ CaOx stones @/di$ still remains unclear.	1
When compared to the WB diet group, the fecal microbiota of EB-fed pigs was found to be enriched in several components that were regarded as health-promoting, including the well-known SCFA producers @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ (acetogenic) and Faecalibacterium (butyrogenic), and Oscillospira. Interestingly, recent evidence points to Oscillospira as a key member of the gut microbiota, being negatively associated with inflammatory diseases and body mass index, probably through the production of butyrate from dietary or host glycoproteins. In particular, relative Oscillospira abundance was found to increase with the switch to a diet rich in protein and fat, thus suggesting an interesting link with the protein and lipid profile of EB, which is worthy of further study. On the other hand, countless studies support the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium, widely accepted as a biomarker of intestinal health, but also @gm$ Blautia @/gm$, which has been associated with decreased inflammation and improved outcomes in several clinical settings, including intestinal diseases, insulin resistance and obesity, and @di$ immunological disorders @/di$.	2
When treating 24-h biofilms with an initial load of approximately 8 log bacteria CFU cm, a significant time-dependent cultivability reduction was only observed for @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ biofilms but without any bactericidal efficacy on P. aeruginosa and glucan-rich @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ biofilms. Accurate direct comparison with the results obtained from the surface-spread condition is rather difficult since the initial microbial load was higher (by a factor 40 to 200) due to the used protocol, which was developed to obtain constant cell density biofilms after 24 h. Therefore, plasma inefficacy within biofilms in respect to SSB could be here attributed to both a higher microbial load and the presence of matrix compounds. However, as initial cell loads for the three biofilms were not significantly different, and also because of their specific biomasses, results obtained in this study thus highlighted the contribution of the ECM in response to @di$ CAP @/di$ treatments. In addition, the data of plasma-induced bacterial reduction for @gm$ L. citreum @/gm$ biofilms grown with or without the addition of sucrose were statistically different, indicating that production of glucans clearly impaired plasma efficacy.	0
Whether ESAT-6 or CFP-10 is present in @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$ and the M. avium-intracellulare complex has not yet been determined. Although PPV is associated with pretest probability of active TB in a cohort, our results showed that the ELISPOT can accurately discriminate TB from NTM disease and other respiratory diseases. All 3 patients with false-positive ELISPOT results had NTM disease. The 3 AFS-positive TB patients with false-negative ELISPOT results had other diseases (2 had @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ and 1 had AIDS), which could weaken the T-cell response .	0
Whether intestinal microbial dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of intestinal inflammation in mice with @di$ colitis @/di$ remains controversial (Dotan and Rachmilewitz; Vieira et al.). Using high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis, we confirmed the regulatory effect of B. lactis BLa80 on the gut microbiota in UC mice. Specifically, B. lactis BLa80 appeared to change the composition of gut microbiota by selectively increasing the abundances of beneficial bacteria such as Romboutsia and @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$, suggesting that BLa80 provides considerable positive support for intestinal homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that species of the genus Romboutsia have multiple metabolic capacities such as carbohydrate utilization, individual amino acids fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and end products of microbial metabolism (Gerritsen; Gerritsen et al.). Recent studies have also shown the apparent depletion of Romboutsia in cancerous mucosa and adenomatous polyps (Mangifesta et al.). @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$, a genus in the phylum Actinobacteria, comprises exclusively anaerobic equol-producing bacteria (Takahashi et al.). Studies have shown that in the human intestine, @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$ species can convert resveratrol to dihydroresveratrol (Bode et al.). Influenza A virus-infected mice treated with Lactobacillus mucosae 1025 and Bifidobacterium pumilus CCFM1026, exhibited increases in the relative abundance of @gm$ Adlercreutzia @/gm$, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, and modulation of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, leading to enhanced production of butyrate (Lu et al.).	2
Whether some gut microbes lie in the pathways from adiposity to @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ is less clear. Our study aims to reveal the temporal relationship between adiposity and gut microbiota and investigate whether gut microbiota may mediate the association of adiposity with @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ in a longitudinal human cohort study. METHODS: We obtained repeated-measured gut shotgun metagenomic and anthropometric data from 426 Chinese participants over ~3 years of follow-up. Cross-lagged path analysis was used to examine the temporal relationship between BMI and gut microbial features. The associations between the gut microbes and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$-related phenotypes were examined using a linear mixed-effect model. We examined the mediation effect of gut microbes on the association between adiposity and @di$ insulin resistance @/di$-related phenotypes. Replication was performed in the HMP cohort. RESULTS: Baseline BMI was prospectively associated with levels of ten gut microbial species. Among them, results of four species (@gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$, Parabacteroides unclassified, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7 1 58FAA) were replicated in the independent HMP cohort. Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1 was inversely associated with HOMA-IR and fasting insulin. Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1 mediated the association of overweight/obesity with HOMA-IR (FDR<0.05). Furthermore, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1 was positively associated with the butyrate-producing pathway PWY-5022 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified one potentially beneficial microbe Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1, which might mediate the effect of adiposity on @di$ insulin resistance @/di$. The identified microbes are helpful for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, as to mitigate the impact of adiposity on @di$ insulin resistance @/di$.	2
While @gm$ Mitsuokella @/gm$ HMT 131 has not previously been associated with @di$ dental caries @/di$, it has been detected and associated with subgingival plaque of periodontitis and dental root canals. Similarly, P. multisaccharivorax has been previously associated with a widerange of oral diseases, including severe early-childhood @di$ caries @/di$, root caries, and periodontal disease. As @gm$ Mitsuokella @/gm$ and Prevotella species were associated with increasing @di$ caries @/di$ severity and failed to respond to the intervention treatment, further research is needed to understand how to limit or control their presence.	1
While Prevotella disiens is also found in the vagina and is associated with vaginosis, @gm$ Pseudomonas mendocina @/gm$ is an opportunistic pathogen linked with @di$ endocarditis @/di$.	1
While the family was altered in several case-control investigations of @di$ ASD @/di$, the direction is not consistent across studies, and is not present in others. A prospective study examining the gut microbiome at six months and scores on the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) at 3 years in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (n = 309 primarily neurotypical children) found an adverse association between Ruminococcus, a genus in the Lachnospiraceae that was also identified in our analyses, and both total ASQ score and personal/social development. We observed an association between a low-abundance Bifidobacterium taxon at two years and worse social behaviors. Bifidobacterium species are generally considered to be beneficial with respect to their psychoactive properties, especially in infants and children. Because this finding was not consistent across time points or in our more probing shotgun metagenomics analyses it may be the result of chance. In our analysis using metagenomic data, which allows more precise identification of bacterial species and strain, we identified an adverse association between Ruminococcus torques, previously found to be increased in @di$ ASD @/di$ cases with gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 54), and SRS-2 performance. We also found an association between @gm$ Adlercreutzia equolifaciens @/gm$ and poorer social behaviors. Although this taxon has not been detected in other @di$ ASD @/di$ studies, its primary product, a phytoestrogen called equol, may interfere with normal microglial function, including essential early-life synaptic pruning, a deficit of which is a putative mechanism for @di$ ASD @/di$. Indeed, one recent study found increased genistein and daidzein (two other phytoestrogens dependent on gut microbial production) in mice colonized with @di$ ASD @/di$-patient microbiomes compared to controls. Importantly, @di$ ASD @/di$ phenotypes, including altered social behaviors, were reduced after restoring gut microbiome metabolomic balance.	1
While the function of ARG1 in infections with @di$ Leishmania spp @/di$. or mycobacteria is well established, little information is currently available on the role of ARG1 for the control of the Gram-negative bacterium @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium @/gm$ (S.tm).	0
While this measure is significantly correlated to anxiety, @di$ depression @/di$ and GSRS score, none of these factors, by themselves or in combination, were correlated to diversity. Most diagnoses that have been studied in connection to the gut microbiome have been characterised by decreased richness. Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that individuals with low self-rated health also have a lower gut microbiome richness. Still, it is possible that the connection between a general feeling of health and the richness of the gut microbiome could be mediated by immune or neurological pathways. Coprococcus catus was associated to lower levels of @di$ depression @/di$. A similar connection at the genus level has been previously reported. Genus Coprococcus_2 which includes @gm$ C. eutactus @/gm$ and uncultured organisms, was also associated to higher self-rated health.	2
White leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated orally with @gm$ Salmonella enteritidis @/gm$ phage type 4 at the age of one day (group 1) and four weeks (group 2). From 3 h until 4 weeks post inoculation (pi), birds were sacrificed. Gross lesions were recorded and different sites of the intestine and visceral organs were collected for bacteriological and histopathological examination. Clinical disease and mortality were only observed in group 1. Mortality was 8%. The birds were @di$ depressed @/di$, had diarrhoea and an indurated yolk sac. Infection of the liver and the heart was present within 12 h pi in both groups. The percentage of infected organs was very high and similar in both groups during the first week pi. Thereafter the isolation rate of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ was declining faster in group 2. The crop, the proventriculus, the lower intestinal tract and the bursa of Fabricius were the predilective sites of isolation in both groups. Most prevalent lesions were serous typhlitis, omphalitis and polyserositis. Histopathology revealed inflammation in the intestines and visceral organs. In some birds granulomatous nodules were present in the caeca. Antibodies were detected from 18 and 5 days pi in group 1 and 2, respectively. Granulomatous nodules were typical of infection with this strain of @gm$ S. enteritidis @/gm$ phage type 4. These granulomatous nodules together with the retained yolk sac possibly are a source of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ organisms that may account for intermittent faecal shedding by carrier birds.	1
Wild-type and @di$ DI-SS @/di$ strains grow similarly on monosaccharides (glucose and xylose), a disaccharide (cellobiose), and a polysaccharide (galactan) (Fig. 4A to D), indicating that targetron insertions in cphy2944 (phage cell wall peptidase) and cphy2993 (phage DNA-binding protein) do not affect growth under these conditions. In contrast, growth of Del-SS was significantly reduced relative to that of the wild-type (WT) on carbon sources other than glucose (Fig. 4A to D), suggesting that the prophage contributes to cell fitness. The organization and sequences of the 50 genes in the @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ prophage region are similar to those in Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1, which has a linear, double-stranded 44-kb DNA genome with all genes transcribed in the same direction. While it is unknown if this @gm$ C. phytofermentans @/gm$ prophage can form lytic particles, it harbors genes for the major phage functions: bacterial cell wall binding and degradation, phage tail assembly, phage head assembly, and DNA synthesis/replication (see Fig.	0
With a tentative diagnosis of @di$ hepatic encephalopathy @/di$, treatment with lactulose, antibiotics, and fluid therapy was initiated. RESULTS: Clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging performed on the animal revealed no abnormalities except for the hyperammoniemia. Absence of HBV markers in the serum indicated unsuccessful inoculation. Not fully responding to therapeutic intervention, the animal was euthanized. Necropsy revealed fibrous peritoneal adhesions and an abscess in the cerebellopontine angle. Exudate culture indicated the presence of alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, @gm$ Eubacterium lentum @/gm$, and Bacteroides stercoris.	1
With respect to the species (MetaPhlAn2) enrichment analyses and co-abundance association analyses, some of MTPS showed benefits to @di$ digestive tract-associated diseases @/di$, such as CD (Bi. longum) and CRC (B. animalis), and solid organ-associated diseases, such as LC (Ba. subtilis) and AS (Lb. casei_paracasei, Lb. fermentum, Sc. thermophilus). Whereas some of MTPS showed potentially adverse effects to cardiometabolic diseases, such T2D (Lb. helveticus) and ACVD (Lb. acidophilus, @gm$ Lactobacillus_delbrueckii @/gm$, Lb. fermentum, Lb. gasseri, Lb. helveticus, Lactococcus_lactis, Sc. thermophilus), and solid organ associated diseases, such as LC (@gm$ Lactobacillus_delbrueckii @/gm$, Lb.	1
With the above-mentioned data, it is reasonable to suggest that treatment of @di$ IE @/di$ by @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ spp. should include a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin or a quinolone with an aminoglycoside. However, a preference towards cephalosporins over quinolones in the case of @di$ IE @/di$ by non-HACEK Gram-negative bacteria is noted in the guidelines.	1
With the aim of developing a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine against @di$ diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus @/di$ (@di$ DPT @/di$), we analyzed the potential of CRM(197), a mutated nontoxic derivative of diphtheria toxin, as the recombinant antigen for a BCG-based vaccine against diphtheria. Expression of CRM(197) in rBCG was achieved using @gm$ Escherichia coli @/gm$-mycobacterium shuttle vectors under the control of pBlaF*, an upregulated beta-lactamase promoter from Mycobacterium fortuitum. Immunization of mice with rBCG-CRM(197) elicited an anti-diphtheria toxoid antibody response, but the sera of immunized mice were not able to neutralize diphtheria toxin (DTx) activity. On the other hand, a subimmunizing dose of the conventional @di$ diphtheria-tetanus @/di$ vaccine, administered in order to mimic an infection, showed that rBCG-CRM(197) was able to prime the induction of a humoral response within shorter periods. Interestingly, the antibodies produced showed neutralizing activity only when the vaccines had been given as a mixture in combination with rBCG expressing tetanus toxin fragment C (FC), suggesting an adjuvant effect of rBCG-FC on the immune response induced by rBCG-CRM(197). Isotype analysis of the anti-diphtheria toxoid antibodies induced by the combined vaccines, but not rBCG-CRM(197) alone, showed an immunoglobulin G1-dominant profile, as did the conventional vaccine. Our results show that rBCG expressing CRM(197) can elicit a neutralizing humoral response and encourage further studies on the development of a @di$ DPT @/di$ vaccine with rBCG.	2
With the exception of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium leprae complex and @gm$ Mycobacterium ulcerans @/gm$ the rest of the species are referred to as NTM and they can be found throughout our environment. The most common clinical presentation is that of pulmonary disease, often occurring in the setting of underlying structural airway disease such as @di$ bronchiectasis @/di$ or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The incidence and prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease are increasing in many areas of the world with rates particularly high in older individuals and those with underlying @di$ bronchiectasis @/di$.	1
Within several years of its discovery in approximately 1982, the association of @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ (@gm$ H. pylori @/gm$) infection with @di$ antral gastritis @/di$ was completely accepted.	1
Within the @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ group, the species designation Bt is defined by the possession of proteinaceous inclusion bodies, mainly formed of the essential virulence factors known as Cry (Crystal) toxins. These are large, pore-forming proteins that enable orally ingested bacteria to invade the invertebrate haemolymph from the midgut (Schnepf et al., 1998). These toxins cause @di$ paralysis @/di$ and are lethal at high doses, but are relatively host-specific and have no known toxicity to vertebrates, hence their widespread incorporation into genetically modified insect-resistant crops (Bravo, Likitvivatanavong, Gill, & Soberon, 2011). The @gm$ B. cereus @/gm$ group possesses a rich diversity of accessory genome elements with numerous large conjugative plasmids (Hu, Van der Auwera, Timmery, Zhu, & Mahillon, 2009; Van der Auwera & Mahillon, 2008; Zheng et al., 2013). @gm$ Bacillus cereus @/gm$ group isolates can contain a large number of plasmids, and this plasmid complement can vary substantially both within and between serotypes (Hu, Swiecicka, Timmery, & Mahillon, 2009; Reyes-Ramirez & Ibarra, 2008), indicating that the accessory genome has the potential to respond rapidly to ecological change.	1
Within the family Eggerthellaceae, the genus Adlercreutzia did not show an increase, while bacteria of the genus Asaccharobacter, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$, Enterorhabdus, and Paraeggerthella increased in abundance (Figure 3L). In particular, the bacteria species Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Assacharobacter WCA-131-CoC-2, @gm$ Eggerthella YY7918 @/gm$, and Enterorhabdus caecimuris were drivers of this increase (Figure S2C), which have been associated with @di$ inflammation @/di$ and infection of the gastrointestinal tract.	1
Worryingly, it is the emergence of hypervirulent-MDR phenotype, especially in @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ isolated. In this regard, Farzana R et al. describe a fatal MDR-hvKv outbreak in neonates in Bangladesh. The isolates contained a blaCTM-M-15 and blaNDM-1 genes, among others, in addition to several virulence genes like siderophore (kfuABC) and Enterobactin (entABCDEFHIJ) associated with hypervirulent phenotype. On the other hand, Lu et al. described the first hvKv isolated from blood from a patient with @di$ cholangitis @/di$ in China, which was resistant to colistin (MIC = 8 ug/mL). These are concordant with our study since we identified an MDR @gm$ K. variicola @/gm$ that was resistant to colistin.	1
Young male inbred strain 2 guinea pigs were infected intradermally with 8 X 10(7) Treponema pallidum extracted from a rabbit @di$ orchitis @/di$, and 5 months later reinfected with 10(7) T. pallidum. Ninety percent of the animals developed symptomatic lesions after initial infection but none on challenge. Immunoblotting of sera obtained at intervals after infection or reinfection showed antibodies against T. pallidum antigen (TP), nonpathogenic treponemes--T. phagedenis biotype Reiter (TR), T. refringens strain Noguchi (TN), and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ (@gm$ TV @/gm$)--as well as normal rabbit serum (NRS) and normal rabbit testes extract (NRT). Antibodies reacting with TP were detected as early as 17 days (five polypeptides) and steadily rose (at 3 months 17 polypeptides were seen).

a @di$ bloodstream infection @/di$ with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) or serovar Paratyphi A, B and C (Salmonella Paratyphi), has an estimated incidence of 27 million cases and causes 190,200 (uncertainty range 23,800-359,100) deaths per year. Non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars, in particular @gm$ Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis @/gm$ (@gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) cause another 3.4 million cases of @di$ bloodstream infections @/di$ and an estimated 681,316 (uncertainty range 415,164-1,301,520) deaths annually, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.	1
abortus, @gm$ B. suis @/gm$, or B. canis. The disease is a worldwide public health problem and a significant cause of economic losses in domestic live-stock. Although largely eradicated in most industrialized countries, in the United States there has been an upsurge of B. melitensis cases associated with the ingestion of unpasteurized goat's milk or goat's milk cheese from Mexico. Brucellosis can be either insidious or abrupt in onset and can affect virtually every organ system; skeletal involvement (spondylitis, @di$ arthritis @/di$) is the most frequent metastatic complication.	1

abortus, and @gm$ B. suis @/gm$ show that their pathogenicity is largely linked to deficient detection by the host innate immune system during the early stages of @di$ infection @/di$. The subsequent delay in induction of the inflammatory response allows these bacteria to reach safe intracellular niches where they multiply and establish long-lasting @di$ infections @/di$.	1

In elderly populations, the abundance and diversity of bifidobacteria significantly decrease and their main bifidobacteria are B. adolescentis, B. longum subsp. longum and B. angulatum. Our current results showed that B. longum was the most abundant species in all groups, except Child in which B. pseudocatenulatum was most abundant and higher than that in adults even though the difference was not significant, though approached it (p = 0.052). A study performed by Wu et al. reported that B. pseudocatenulatum was the most dominant Bifidobacterium species after dietary intervention with non-digestible but fermentable carbohydrates in a genetically @di$ obese @/di$ child, which suggests that B.	0

Only for strains DK2 and LES400 no significant potentiating effect could be observed. For all tobramycin resistant strains tested (1709-12, Mi126, AMT0023-34) increased susceptibility to tobramycin was observed in the presence of 3-D CM.

Uptake and conversion of sulfate esters or carbon bonded sulfate derivatives into inorganic sulfate:the form of sulfur used by plants for production of cysteine and other essential sulfur containing compounds:is an important process performed in the rhizosphere by bacteria, including Pseudomonads . Sulfur metabolism is an important process for both P. aeruginosa and @gm$ P. putida @/gm$, based on its important role in this common habitat. However, it has also been shown that a significantly different but also sulfur rich environment can be found in the @di$ CF @/di$ lung, where mucin (the family of glycosylated proteins forming the basis of mucus) forms a major source of nutrition for P. aeruginosa. Several findings in literature support the importance of sulfated mucin in defining the in vivo environment in the @di$ CF @/di$ lung, including the enhancement of mucin sulfation in @di$ CF @/di$ patients versus in the normal lung, the presence of multiple highly regulated sulfur uptake mechanisms in P. aeruginosa that respond differently to the presence of inorganic sulfate versus the presence of more complex organosulfur compounds, and most notably, the demonstrated ability of P. aeruginosa @di$ CF @/di$ isolates to utilize mucin as a sole sulfur source, .	0

and @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$. Maintaining a more diverse gut microbiota composition is generally considered beneficial to health, with lower alpha diversity being associated with several disease states such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and IBD. Previous studies have demonstrated that EEN interventions in CD patients lead to rapid reductions in microbial diversity, which aligns with what we observed in mice fed EEN. EEN and chow fed mice also experienced a bloom in bacterial taxa known to cause @di$ bacteremia @/di$ and recurrent diarrhea, be in higher abundances in IBD patients, and/or are associated with non-sustained remission once EEN is discontinued. The increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria paralleled a significant reduction in bacteria with known anti-inflammatory properties such as Bifidobacterium spp., as well as butyrate-producing bacteria (ie, @gm$ Anaerostipes caccae @/gm$) in the EEN and chow groups.	1

"and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ spp. were found to be more abundant in women with obesity and metabolic syndrome. R. gnavus utilizes glycans from the intestinal mucus layer as energy sources; it was significantly more abundant in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) when compared to a control group, and found to grow when IBD activity increased, which was explained as it had gene families involved in protection against the oxidative stress response in IBD gut. In the former study, women with PCOS, whether fat or lean, showed an increased reactive oxygen species level, which positively correlated with androgen secretion stimulated by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). The reason that R. gnavus was abundant in women with PCOS may be because its clade led to a tolerance of the oxidative stress environment found in the gut, as well as several genes that could help in the utilization of adhesion and mucus. R. gnavus was also observed to be associated with @di$ respiratory allergies @/di$ and their increase before the onset of allergy symptoms. Several @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ and Lachnospiraceae species are butyrate-producing colon bacteria, and play an important role in colonic health such as in improving the intestinal barrier. Roseburia sp. 11SE38 is from unclassified Roseburia, and L. bacterium 2_1_58FAA is from unclassified Lachnospiraceae, both exist mostly in patients with PCOS according to a heatmap ( Figure 4 ), meaning it may have different effects from other ""good"" species in @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$. In a study by Raman et al. of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the amount of Lachnospiraceae and @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ was increased in such patients, which indicated that these bacteria may be associated with metabolic dysfunction in the body."	1
and Porphyromonas sp., the @di$ periodontal @/di$ pathogen Tannerella forsythia, asaccharolytic obligate Gram-negative Dialister sp., Fusobacterium sp. and Gram-negative bacteria with periplasmic flagella such as Treponema sp.. Besides this, primary infections also comprise Gram-positive anaerobic rods, Gram-positive cocci that can persist endodontic treatment (@gm$ Parvimonas micra @/gm$, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus faecalis), Gram-negative microaerophilic rods (Campylobacter sp.) and several uncultivated phylotypes as well as fungi, archaea, and viruses. Secondary infections can be caused by reinfection, remnant infection or recurrent infection in previously root canal treated teeth. Secondary infections are characterized by the persistence of enterococci, streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces, fungi and E. faecalis. Bacteroides-like species and Dialister sp. were detected in asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions, whereas obligate anaerobes Fusobacterium nucleatum, P. intermedia, Dialister pneumosintes were found in symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. Cultivation of isolates from root canals with necrotic pulps and failed endodontic treatment showed anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria in 70% of cases, mainly containing @gm$ P. micra @/gm$ (formerly @gm$ Peptostreptococcus micros @/gm$), Fusobacterium necrophorum, F.	1

are emerging pathogens that cause severe @di$ infantile meningitis @/di$, septicemia, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Contaminated powdered infant formula has been implicated as the source of Cronobacter spp. in most cases, but questions still remain regarding the natural habitat and virulence potential for each strain. The iron acquisition systems in 231 @gm$ Cronobacter @/gm$ strains isolated from different sources were identified and characterized. All Cronobacter spp. have both the Feo and Efe systems for acquisition of ferrous iron, and all plasmid-harboring strains (98%) have the aerobactin-like siderophore, cronobactin, for transport of ferric iron. All Cronobacter spp. have the genes encoding an enterobactin-like siderophore, although it was not functional under the conditions tested. Furthermore, all Cronobacter spp. have genes encoding five receptors for heterologous siderophores. A ferric dicitrate transport system (fec system) is encoded specifically by a subset of @gm$ Cronobacter sakazakii @/gm$ and C. malonaticus strains, of which a high percentage were isolated from clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the fec system is most closely related to orthologous genes present in human-pathogenic bacterial strains. Moreover, all strains of C. dublinensis and C. muytjensii encode two receptors, FcuA and Fct, for heterologous siderophores produced by plant pathogens. Identification of putative Fur boxes and expression of the genes under iron-depleted conditions revealed which genes and operons are components of the Fur regulon. Taken together, these results support the proposition that @gm$ C. sakazakii @/gm$ and C.	1
are opportunistic pathogens that can cause @di$ diarrhea @/di$, septicemia, meningitis, and urinary tract infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Together with our previous studies, we found 25 highly cytotoxic Citrobacter isolates out of 271 (9.2%), 15 were isolated from diarrheal patients (11.4% of diarrheal isolates), seven from foods (6.7% food isolates), two from healthy individuals (8.7%) and 1 from the environment (9.1%). The 22 highly cytotoxic Citrobacter isolates were distributed among the five lineages identified. However, Lineage II (@gm$ C. freundii @/gm$) and Lineage V (C.	1

Overall, Legionella pneumophila is the clinically most relevant species, followed by @gm$ Legionella longbeachae @/gm$, which is associated with outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease particularly in Australia and New Zealand (Newton et al.,). The Gram-negative bacteria are ubiquitously found in the environment, where they inhabit natural and man-made freshwater systems. Upon inhalation of Legionella-laden aerosols, the opportunistic pathogenic bacteria enter the human lung, where they infect alveolar macrophages and might cause a fulminant @di$ pneumonia @/di$ (Figure 1).	1

In developed countries, Campylobacter jejuni and @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ are the predominately isolated species associated with human bacterial diarrheal disease. Primarily, most of the zoonotic Campylobacters are well adapted as a commensal in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry, cattle, sheep, and pigs and can act as reservoirs. Humans can be infected with Campylobacter via consumption of contaminated meat and poultry including dairy products. Additionally, Campylobacter can contaminate the soil or water bodies to facilitate human @di$ infection @/di$ or even direct human-to-human transmission.	1

However, concomitant administration of the microbial consortium with the bifidobacteria resulted in decrease of the high mRNA levels of Nrlp3 and Il-1beta induced by B. breve 1101A and an increase in these transcripts in the @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ 1622A group, although it did not reach the high levels achieved by B. breve 1101A. Previous in vitro data may help explaining the different outcomes on the control of @di$ periodontitis @/di$ by the two tested bifidobacteria. P. gingivalis W83 challenged gingival epithelial cells showed increased viability when co-infected with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ 1622A but not with B. breve 1101A. On the other hand, co-culture of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 challenged GECs with B. breve 1101A resulted in high production of IL-1beta and CXCL-8 differing from infected GECs co-cultured with @gm$ B. bifidum @/gm$ 1622A.	2

butyricum CBM 588 can inhibit gastrointestinal inflammation and side effects of antibiotic treatments, such as @di$ diarrhea @/di$. Consequently, oral administration of this probiotic might prevent inflammation-associated diseases such as UC. Chen et al. reported that C. butyricum CBM 588 co-supplementation with H. pylori quadruple therapy exhibited a significant reduction in Fusobacteria and Tenericutes phyla as well as an increase in Actinobacteria phylum following H. pylori eradication. However, @gm$ Lactococcus raffinolactis @/gm$, Lactobacillus sakei, and Acinetobacter baumannii NIPH60 were significantly increased only in the antibiotic group.	0
catenulatum group, on the other hand, showed a significant age-associated increase similar to that of @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$, although the bacterial count of the B. catenulateum group plateaued at about 1 y earlier than the @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ count. In a study aimed to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota in adolescents, the counts of both the B. catenulatum group and the Clostridium leptum group which is phylogenetically closely related to @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ were significantly higher in the high-@di$ weight loss @/di$ group than in the low-@di$ weight loss @/di$ group before and after intervention. Conversely, the counts of B. breve and B. bifidum, which showed no significant age-associated increase in the count in the present study, were significantly lower in the former group than in the latter group. These results suggested that there is a close association between the B. catenulatum group and @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ with regard to nutritional and ecological requirements in the intestinal tract of the host, which are considerablly different from those required by the phase II-dominant Bifidobacterium species such as B.	2

chimaera, @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$, and M. abscessus are the species most commonly reported to cause human disease. M. abscessus accounts for the majority of lung disease caused by rapidly-growing mycobacteria and is difficult to treat due to high level of innate resistance. The common predisposing conditions for M. abscessus infection are pulmonary diseases such as bronchiectasis, @di$ COPD @/di$ and cystic fibrosis, where the increased mucus production pose additional problems for treatment. Through analysis of bactericidal concentrations of the peptide against these strains, we found differences between the slow growing M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. chimaera, @gm$ M. kansasii @/gm$ and the rapidly growing M.	1
cholerae O1 and O139 is a factor causing diarrhea with severe @di$ dehydration @/di$ by ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit of the GTP-binding protein which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity.

cholerae and @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$. These include the toxR/toxS virulence regulators, multiple hemolysins and lipases, VSP-I and II, and a type 6 secretion system. Both VSP islands are also present in pathogenic strains of the seventh pandemic clade. Although neither genome encodes CTXPhi phage, the major virulence factor encoding the cholera toxin (CT) that is responsible for the profuse secretory @di$ diarrhea @/di$ caused by toxigenic V. cholerae and @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$, both genomes do have homologous sequences of the chromosomal attachment site for this phage.	1
cholerae are human pathogens causing cholera and vibriosis such as gastroenteritis, open wounds infection, and @di$ septicaemia @/di$. Recently, interaction of V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae O139, and @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ with Acanthamoeba species has shown that V.	1
cholerae, @gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ strains which are normally TCP negative have also been shown to occasionally produce CT and cause @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in humans. We analyzed nontoxigenic @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains isolated from surface waters in Bangladesh for susceptibility and lysogenic conversion by CTXPhi and studied the expression of CT in the lysogens by using genetically marked derivatives of the phage. Of 27 @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains analyzed, which were all negative for genes encoding TCP but positive for the regulatory gene toxR, 2 strains (7.4%) were infected by CTX-KmPhi, derived from strain SM44(P27459 ctx::km), and the phage genome integrated into the host chromosome, forming stable lysogens. The lysogens spontaneously produced infectious phage particles in the supernatant fluids of the culture, and high titers of the phage could be achieved when the lysogens were induced with mitomycin C. This is the first demonstration of lysogenic conversion of @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains by CTXPhi. When a genetically marked derivative of the replicative form of the CTXPhi genome carrying a functional ctxAB operon, pMSF9.2, was introduced into nontoxigenic @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains, the plasmid integrated into the host genome and the strains produced CT both in vitro and inside the intestines of adult rabbits and caused mild-to-severe @di$ diarrhea @/di$ in rabbits. This suggested that in the natural habitat infection of nontoxigenic @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains by wild-type CTXPhi may lead to the origination of toxigenic @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ strains which are capable of producing biologically active CT.	1
cohnii colonizes and causes @di$ bacteremia @/di$. S. pneumoniae colonization can interact with other commensal bacteria through cooperative or competitive relationships. S. pneumoniae cooperatively interacts with H. influenzae and S. cohnii. The clinical data showed that SY1 patients had breathing difficulty symptoms that might be due to the overgrowth of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. cohnii in the respiratory tract. Interestingly, @gm$ Veillonella @/gm$ parvulla had a higher relative abundance in both symptomatic patients (SY1 and SY2) than in asymptomatic patients (Fig. 9). This suggested that the presence of @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ might be related to the symptoms of patients with COVID-19. Previously, @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ was also found to increase its abundance in patients with COVID-19 compared with the normal patients.	1
coli (60.9%) was the most frequently isolated species from the carcasses with cellulitis followed by @gm$ Aeromonas @/gm$ spp. (20.6%) and P. mirabilis (12.5%) (Table 1). The common isolation of E. coli is consistent with several reports among birds with cellulitis. Cellulitis usually develops from initial skin scratches, which allow entry of bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue where they subsequently proliferate and cause infection. However, as carcasses with cellulitis in the current study were free from scratches, the development of cellulitis may be attributed to other predisposing factors, i.e., wet irritated skin in combination with stress, genetic factors, @di$ nutritional deficiency @/di$, population density, litter quality, and breeders' and hatchery hygiene. A recent investigation of management factors associated with cellulitis reported that measures to reduce stress in broiler flocks reduced the risk of cellulitis.

coli causing diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and @di$ hemolytic uremic syndrome @/di$ (@di$ HUS @/di$). STEC are characterized by a constellation of virulence factors additional to Stx and have long been regarded as capable to cause HC and @di$ HUS @/di$ when possessing the ability of inducing the attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion to the enterocyte, although strains isolated from such severe infections sometimes lack this virulence feature. Interestingly, the capability to cause the A/E lesion is shared with another E. coli pathogroup, the Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). In the very recent times, a different type of STEC broke the scene causing a shift in the paradigm for @di$ HUS @/di$-associated STEC. In 2011, a @gm$ STEC O104:H4 @/gm$ caused a large outbreak with more than 800 @di$ HUS @/di$ and 50 deaths.	1
coli in the initial gut microbiota was associated with an increase in BMI at 1 year (8/10 with a @di$ weight gain @/di$ versus 3/11 without @di$ weight gain @/di$, P=0.03). A logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and surgery identified an association between the absence of E. coli and @di$ weight gain @/di$ at 1 year (odds ratio=10.7; 95% confidence interval 1.39-82.0); P=0.02). This was confirmed using %deltaBMI (mean+-standard Error, 4.0+-2.1 for patients without E. coli versus -3.4+-2.0 for patients with E. coli, P=0.01, Figure 3). This was also true when one outlier (a patient with a BMI increase of 19%) was excluded (n=20, 2.5+-1.6 versus -3.4+-2.0, P=0.03). We did not find any other significant differences regarding other bacteria (L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, B. animalis, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and the Lactobacillus genus) or data from the amoxicillin-treated patients.	0
coli is the causative agent for the majority of UTIs, while only one in four UTIs is caused by ESBL-producing @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$. It is, hence, crucial that we understand its role in the subversion of host innate immunity. We found that uropathogenic E. coli was associated with lower serum inflammatory markers measured as serum CRP level compared to @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$. This difference in the level of CRP between the two uropathogens is indicative of the difference in innate-immune responses initiated against these uropathogens. Recently, it has been reported that uropathogenic E. coli subverts the host innate-immune system by causing zinc mediated toxicity to persist and disseminate within the host. An inverse relationship between serum CRP levels and zinc was acutely reported in UTI patients. Therefore, our finding that CRP levels are downregulated during E. coli UTI compared to @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ is in line with the reported pathogenesis mechanisms of E. coli. Clinically, @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$, which cause the highest acute inflammatory response measured as elevated CRP may rarely cause @di$ renal scars @/di$.	0
coli originates from outbreak studies of a specific serotype, @gm$ E. coli O157:H7 @/gm$ (@gm$ EHEC @/gm$) infection which can cause watery life-threatening diarrhea, @di$ hemorrhagic colitis @/di$, hemolytic-uremia syndrome (HUS), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), particularly in young children and the elderly due to the production of verotoxins. The infectious dose of @gm$ EHEC @/gm$ bacterium is significantly lower than other pathogenic strains of E. coli (as low as 100 @gm$ EHEC @/gm$ cells). Infections of humans by @gm$ EHEC @/gm$ @gm$ O157:H7 @/gm$ can take place via direct contact with animal carriers or their feces, consumption of undercooked or raw ground beef, as well as contaminated water, milk, vegetables, and fruits. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, from 2003 to 2008, @gm$ EHEC @/gm$ infections were responsible for 32 outbreaks in the United States such as large outbreaks resulting from consumption of contaminated spinach and iceberg and romaine lettuce.	1

SdiA also represses flagellar genes and the genes of the LEE pathogenicity island (LEE) of EHEC. A model has been proposed in which EHEC SdiA detects AHLs in the bovine rumen where acid resistance is increased and LEE expression is repressed. @di$ AHL @/di$ is no longer encountered beyond the rumen allowing the LEE to be expressed so that the recto-anal junction can be colonized.	0

compared the subgingival bacterial flora cultured from children and adults with naturally occurring @di$ gingivitis @/di$ with that in healthy controls and subjects with moderate, severe, and juvenile periodontitis. This showed that in both children and adults with naturally occurring @di$ gingivitis @/di$, @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was more numerous than in healthy controls or those with periodontitis. Based on their findings Moore et al. suggested that the composition of the subgingival microflora represented a transition between that associated with health and periodontitis. In a similar study Macuch and Tanner compared the presence of Campylobacter spp. in healthy subjects with that in subjects with @di$ gingivitis @/di$, initial periodontitis, and established periodontitis. While @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ was more frequently isolated from subjects with initial periodontitis (approximately 68%) than healthy individuals (35%), the isolation rates from those with @di$ gingivitis @/di$ (32%), or established periodontitis (32%) did not differ from that in controls (Macuch and Tanner,). Interestingly, the proportion of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ as a percentage of all @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ species was higher in shallow pocket sites (19.7%) as compared with deep pocket sites (6.6%) and healthy controls.	1
concluded that @di$ infection @/di$ of S. anginosus could occur frequently in OSCC and that dental plaque could be a dominant reservoir of the S. anginosus. Mager et al. determined the relationship of 40 common salivary bacteria counts between oral cancer patients and controls and reported that OSCC patients tend to have significantly elevated concentrations of certain bacteria in their saliva. High salivary counts of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and @gm$ Streptococcus mitis @/gm$ could serve as potential diagnostic indicators of OSCC.	1

Lactobacilli are thought to play an important role in protecting the host from urogenital infection by lowering the environmental pH through lactic acid production, by producing various bacteriostatic and bactericidal substances such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and through competitive exclusion. Decrease in the number of lactobacilli and overgrowth of diverse anaerobes is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) , which is one of the most common @di$ vaginal syndromes @/di$ among women in their reproductive age .	2
described extensive optimization of electroporation for @gm$ Staphylococcus carnosus @/gm$. Application of the final protocol with minor modifications to S. aureus strain Newman gave a 50-fold improvement over the sucrose-wash protocol (Monk et al.,) with transformants being obtained directly with DNA isolated from E. coli K-12 strains at a low frequency (between 101 and 102 CFU/5 mug plasmid DNA). In strain Newman the restriction barriers cause a 10-4 reduction in the transformation efficiency when comparing uptake of plasmid DNA isolated from wild-type Newman with that isolated from E. coli K-12. Thus improving the efficiency of electroporation allowed the @di$ type IV @/di$ and type I RM systems to be bypassed.	0

difficile produces colitis and/or @di$ enterocolitis @/di$ in humans and multiple animal species. The main virulence factors of this microorganism are toxins A, B and an ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT). Other clostridia causing enteric diseases in humans and/or animals are Clostridium spiroforme, Clostridium piliforme, Clostridium colinum, @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$, Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium neonatale.	1
difficile, had higher proportions of Lachnospiraceae (@gm$ Roseburia @/gm$), which are involved in the production of butyrate. Butyrate is the preferred energy source of colonic endothelial cells (colonocytes) and plays a major role in the regulation of colonocyte proliferation and the differentiation and maintenance of intestinal epithelial integrity. Lachnospiraceae were shown to be partially protective against C. difficile in murine and human studies. For example, in adult allogeneic-HSCT patients, Lachnospiraceae were associated with a 60% lower risk of @di$ C. difficile colitis @/di$ independent of other risk factors.	2
"distasonis abundance was significantly elevated in fecal samples from patients with @di$ ankylosing spondylitis @/di$ (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and the sacroiliac joint. This suggests a possible role for P. distasonis in the development of more diverse autoimmune responses. In vitro experiments showed that P. distasonis, along with other AS-enriched species including Bacteroides coprophilus, Eubacterium siraeum, @gm$ Acidaminococcus fermentans @/gm$, and Prevotella copri, increased the amount of IFN-gamma-producing cells through a bacterial peptide of these species, mimicking type II collagen and likely serving as ""triggers of autoimmunity by molecular mimicry""."	1
distasonis in UC with @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity was greater than that of the patients without @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity. Some previous investigations have suggested that P. distasonis could serve as a potential probiotic to improve human and animal digestive health. R. bromii was also found to be more abundant in UC with @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity. As far back as a decade ago, Ze et al. proposed that R. bromii possessed excellent ability to degrade resistant starch particles in human colon. The effect of R. bromii as a probiotic was further confirmed in subsequent investigations. Interestingly, we also identified another important bacterial species that was highly abundant in the UC patients with @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity, that is, @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$. A higher bacterial abundance was observed in the completely healthy individuals than in those without @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity. @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ was first discovered and named by Fumiko et. al in 2009. Recently, an essential role has been ascribed to @gm$ A. indistinctus @/gm$ in the maintenance of intestinal microflora balance and gastrointestinal health. Overall, we speculate that UC patients with @di$ overweight @/di$/obesity have alterations of gut microbial compositions, especially elevations of some probiotics.	2

eggerthii developed much more severe DSS-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ than control mice gavaged with the entire WT microflora, manifested by significantly shortened survival, significantly accelerated loss of body weight, significantly accelerated and increased stool scores and intestinal bleeding (Fig 5B), and frank bleeding from the anus (Fig 5C). We also evaluated histopathological changes as a measure of the severity of @di$ colitis @/di$. Mice gavaged with P. falsenii, or P. distasonis, or B. eggerthii had significantly more pronounced hyperplasia of lamina propria, loss of crypts, infiltration with inflammatory cells, loss of epithelium, loss of goblet cells, and ulceration, compared with mice gavaged with WT stools, which after the same duration of DSS treatment had only low histopathological changes (Fig 5D and 5E). The @di$ colitis @/di$ was most severe in mice gavaged with P. falsenii or B. eggerthii, and moderately severe with P. distasonis. By contrast, based on the same criteria, mice gavaged with @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ showed significantly less severe @di$ colitis @/di$ than mice gavaged with P. falsenii, or P. distasonis, or B. eggerthii. @di$ Colitis @/di$ in mice gavaged with @gm$ A. finegoldii @/gm$ was similar in severity and not significantly different than @di$ colitis @/di$ in mice gavaged with WT stools, except for somewhat more severe colon infiltration with inflammatory cells (Fig 5B-5D).	2

erinaceus supplementation could reverse the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria enriched or reduced in some diseases, such as @gm$ Bacteroides caccae @/gm$ enriched in @di$ metabolic arthritis @/di$ patients, Phascolarctobacterium enriched in kidney stones patients, Romboutsia timonensis enriched in patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Streptococcus thermophilus that is a predictor of poor prognosis for liver cirrhosis, and Coprococcus comes decreased in patients with chronic widespread pain. Studies have shown that some bacteria which can contribute to human health include SCFAs-producing bacteria (Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Subdoligranulum) and other probiotics like Parabacteroides, Dialister. A previous study found that the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, and Roseburia in patients with @di$ metabolic arthritis @/di$ were significantly decreased. Our results, measured using biochemical blood indices, demonstrate a downregulation in UA and CREA. Therefore, we propose that alterations in gut microbiota due to H. erinaceus intervention may be related to @di$ metabolic arthritis @/di$.	2

(3) It is unclear why three pathogens interact to induce salpingitis both in laying hens and in breeder ducks. As for the opportunistic pathogens, both E. faecalis and E. coli are widely present in the environment and they are diffused by air, water and other means. Traditionally, both pathogens are colonized in gastrointestinal tracts and then transmitted to blood circulation and reproductive tracts once birds suffer immune suppression or external stress.

fortuitum, @gm$ M. chelonae @/gm$, M. kansasii, M. gordonae and M. xenopi are the most commonly described, especially in water. EM exhibit considerable tolerance to unfavourable conditions and are able to survive aggressive treatments like chlorination or ozonation of water. EM are opportunistic pathogens and are transmitted to humans via inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation. Immunocompromised individuals are particularly at risk for infection. Although such individuals do not typically work in mines or in heavy industry, EM can also represent a high risk for ordinary employees. In particular, miners in collieries are exposed to highly dusty environments, often work in mines over their entire working life and are frequently heavy smokers. Further, some of these workers develop @di$ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease @/di$.	1

However, none of the species was able to predict the future event of OHE. Moreover, they found an inverse correlation between bacterial species producing SCFAs and @di$ cirrhosis @/di$ severity and lower concentrations of six specifical fecal SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and succinate) in patients with a history of OHE, thus supporting a crucial role of these metabolites in HE pathogenesis.	2

fulva and @gm$ P. putida @/gm$) was first identified in our hospital in the summer of 2010 and reoccurred in the following year. Based on the epidemiological data collected in these 2 years, we initiated an investigation on the source of the outbreak. The aim of this study was to report the results of the investigation, as well as the intervention strategies that resulted in successful control of the outbreak. METHODS: An infection control team was set up consisting of infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, and head nurses. The microbiology and medical records of case-patients with P. fulva or @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ bloodstream infections were reviewed. Environmental samples and intravenous (IV) solutions from the wards and the pharmacy center were collected for culturing. The molecular characteristics of the bacterial isolates were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Strict infection control strategies were implemented. RESULTS: A total of 20 case-patients from five inpatient wards were identified during three summer seasons from 2010 to 2012. Nineteen of them recovered with proper antibiotics. Unfortunately one died from complications of @di$ heart failure @/di$. A total of 19 isolates of P. fulva and four of @gm$ P. putida @/gm$ were identified, of which 20 were from blood, two from environmental surface samples from the hospital pharmacy, and one from an in-use compounded solution from a case-patient in the cardiology ward.	0

Enterorhabdus genus is a member of the Actinobacteria phylum and Coriobacteriia class that has been associated with ileocecal mucosal inflammation in mice. Enterorhabdus mucosicola and Enterorhabdus caecimuris species were both isolated from the ileocecal regions of mice suffering from @di$ colitis @/di$ and intestinal inflammation.	1
gingivalis and @gm$ B. asaccharolyticus @/gm$. In addition, B. intermedius-like organisms were isolated. The last two species were observed only after splint placement. The local accumulation of helicoidal-shaped micro-organisms in the epithelial tissue rather than in the micro-ulcerations was regarded as an indication of an active role for these spirochetes in the disease process. The observed shift toward tissue-invading and potentially pathogenic micro-organisms after splinting stresses the need for antimicrobial measures during splint placement in order to minimize @di$ periodontal destruction @/di$.	1
gingivalis has been associated as a risk factor for developing obesity and @di$ diabetes @/di$. Interestingly, we found that the class Coriobacteria, order Coriobacteriales, family Coriobacteraceae, genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ and species @gm$ Collinsella aerofaciens @/gm$ were significantly more abundant, specifically in the OMS as compared to O and NW (Fig. 2), suggesting them as potential biomarkers for obesity with metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, this species also showed a significant positive correlation with triglycerides (r = 0.62, p = 0.00053), while showing a negative correlation with HDL (r = - 0.4, p = 0.039). Also, the genus @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ correlated positively with triglycerides (r = 0.64, p = 0.00029), BMI (r = 0.39, p = 0.044), and a negative correlation with HDL (r = - 0.4, p = 0.036), and had a weak positive correlation with waist circumference (r = 0.35, p = 0.073). The same behavior was observed with the corresponding family Coriobacteriaceae, order Coriobacteriales and class Coriobacteriia (Additional file 5: Table S2). We suggest that these taxa may be considered as biomarkers for OMS. In this regard, it was recently reported that an altered abundance of @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ genus changes the host's plasma cholesterol levels, showing a positive correlation with LDL cholesterol. Additionally, another study with big cohorts of adults recently reported the finding of an increased @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ abundance in obese patients. Also, it has been observed that low dietary fiber intake increases @gm$ Collinsella @/gm$ abundance in the gut microbiota of obese pregnant women.	1
gingivalis have been shown to induce @di$ platelet aggregation @/di$ in vitro. Here we report that P. gingivalis was able to induce @di$ platelet aggregation @/di$, and that oral strains of Actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, @gm$ Bacteroides forsythus @/gm$, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Trepenoma denticola failed to aggregate platelets when tested for @di$ platelet aggregation @/di$ activity under similar conditions. Additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of P. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse @di$ platelet aggregation @/di$ in vitro. In summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by P. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) P. gingivalis vesicles possess @di$ platelet aggregation @/di$-inducing activity.	0

gnavus and a decrease of @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ and CZBV_s, suggesting the possibility that these cerebrovascular diseases may share a common pathological background. It has previously been reported that the relative abundance of @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ were decreased in men with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than male controls. This is in line with the evidence that HDL level was inversely associated with MMD and ICAD. Other reports showed that @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ was decreased in patients with @di$ atherosclerotic disease @/di$ and those with Crohn's disease, suggesting that @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ may be inversely associated with inflammatory condition.	2
gnavus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Dialister invisus, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, several Blautia and Parabacteroides species compared with healthy controls (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05). On the contrary, their gut microbiome was depleted of Bif. longum, Bacteroides dorei, B. vulgatus and some fiber-degrading taxa (e.g., Roseburia CAG_471, R. bromii; Fig. 1a). However, when evaluating the differences associated with the type of allergy, we also identified some allergy-specific signatures. Children with FA showed a microbial pattern characterized by decreased abundance of B. vulgatus, and higher levels of Blautia wexlerae compared with RA (p < 0.05; Fig. 1b). In contrast, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$ and Prevotella copri were higher in subjects with RA compared with both CT and FA patients (Fig. 1b). Since we recently demonstrated the presence of at least 12 different species within Faecalibacterium genus, we used the same pipeline to test the occurrence of F. prausnitzii clades in the samples. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii clade A (that includes, among others, the strain L2-6, previously linked with @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$) was enriched in FA, compared with both RA and CT (chi-squared test, p < 0.05).	1

As a result, the HP-LC and high fat diet of the bodybuilders is expected to lower the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and, in particular, to lower the relative abundance of acetate-producing bacteria and lactate-producing bacteria, thus influencing the substrate supply of butyrate-producing bacteria. Sutterella, highly expressed in athletes, is a genus of Gram-negative, anaerobic, nonspore-forming bacteria that is associated with autism, @di$ Down's syndrome @/di$, and inflammatory disease.	0

Strains of these bacterial species were used to infect nauplii, protozoea I-III, @di$ mysis I-III @/di$, and postlarvae 1 by immersion challenge at 10(3), 10(5), or 10(7) cfu mL(-1) for 30 min. V. alginolyticus infection had no significant effect on survival rate, compared to control, in all shrimp larvae and at all doses tested. Shrimp larvae infected with V. alginolyticus showed a high survival rate compared to other Vibrio species at the three dose levels. V. penaeicida produced a significant mortality effect (P < 0.01) in all shrimp substages and only in postlarvae 1 at low infection dose (10(3) cfu mL(-1)). V. harveyi and @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ induced significant mortality rates (P < 0.01) only at high doses in shrimp larvae.	1

Another study by Gevers et al. on the abundance of several genera such as Faecalibacterium, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Blautia, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus (all phylum Firmicutes) and a number of taxa within the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae also showed a decrease in abundance. Interestingly, some of these taxa were present in greater abundance in patients younger than 10 years than in older children, indicating an inverse relationship with age, including Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae. In the stool samples also studied by Gevers et al., such a change was detected only to a small extent. In contrast, Lewis et al. found in a study with stool samples from children on the one hand a reduced abundance of Prevotella, Odoribacter, Alistipes, Parabacteroides (all four phylum Bacteroidetes), Eubacterium, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$, Coprococcus, Dorea, Ruminococcus (families of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, all phylum Firmicutes), Akkermansia (phylum Verrucomicrobiota) and, on the other hand, an increased abundance of Escherichia, Klebsiella (family Enterobacteriaceae, phylum Proteobacteria), Enterococcus and Veillonella (both phylum Firmicutes).	2

However, they keep the immune system alert, due to their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. In this genus, the @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ was the only species which was identified in our study. This bacterium was associated with fat-rich diets and intestinal inflammation. Emerging studies have suggested that limiting the prevalence of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ in the gut microbiome could have a therapeutic effect on metabolic diseases and intestinal inflammation.	1

They are part of commensal bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, affecting colonic motility, immunity maintenance and anti-inflammatory properties. Modification in Roseburia spp. representation may affect various metabolic pathways and is associated with several diseases (including irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, nervous system conditions and allergies). Roseburia spp. could also serve as biomarkers for symptomatic pathologies (e.g., @di$ gallstone formation @/di$) or as probiotics for restoration of beneficial flora.	0

However, only some of them such as O3, O6, O11, O14, O16, O18, O21, O29, O33, O34 and O41 seem to be associated with virulence for specific fish species and more than 60% of the septicemia cases are related to four of these serotypes: (O11, O16, O18 and O34). Serotype O11 is associated with severe infections in humans, like septicemia, meningitis and @di$ peritonitis @/di$ while serotype O34, the most common in mesophilic Aeromonas, is associated with wound infections in humans and outbreaks of septicemia in fishes.	1

In addition, the frequency of Campylobacter and Salmonella was also determined. Stool samples (n = 152) were collected from 152 diarrheic children less than six years of age passing blood and mucus in their stools who were admitted to Paediatric Department of Mayo Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan from June to September 1990. The samples were cultivated on standard media for @gm$ Shigella @/gm$, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. Susceptibility of @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolates was tested by disk diffusion method. The frequency of isolation was 19.1% for Shigella spp., 7.9% for Campylobacter, and 4.6% for Salmonella. @gm$ Shigella flexneri @/gm$ (7.9%) was the most frequently isolated species, followed by S. dysenteriae (6.6%), S. boydii, (3.3%) and S. sonnei (1.3%). All @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid (100%), while only a few were susceptible to cotrimoxazole (7.0%) and ampicillin (3.5%).	1

jejuni and @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ infection within humans, and found that while infection with C. jejuni was more aggressive, it lasted for a shorter time period than infection with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$. Moreover, six months following diagnosis, 12% of patients infected with @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ were diagnosed with microscopic @di$ colitis @/di$, whereas no C. jejuni patients were diagnosed with non-infective @di$ colitis @/di$. Thus, to identify possible factors involved in the differences between @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ and C. jejuni infections, a comparative analysis of the eight genomes of @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ with the nine available genomes of C. jejuni was performed (Figure 6, Additional file 1: Table S6). While the core genome of the @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains was defined to be 1556 genes, the C. jejuni core genome contained 1416 genes. Comparison of the two core genomes identified 1033 genes that were shared between the two species, while 523 genes were specific to the @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ core and 383 specific to the C. jejuni core (Figure 6A). Enrichment analysis of the core genes specific to each species were performed using Blast2Go (Figure 6B, C), and complemented with pathway analyses of all genomes using the KEGG database. Evidence that the genome assembly was correct was the absence of the catalase gene within all @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ genomes and the presence of this gene within the C. jejuni genomes, which is in line with the fact that @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ is a catalase-negative organism while C.	1

lactis, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ were administered in combination with a fermented oat drink or as a powder. However, the patients in these clinical trials were not diagnosed with chronic constipation, and these studies included patients who had @di$ diarrhea @/di$.	0
lactis, and @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$ exhibited no alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. Measurement of the internal pH of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (DeltapH) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-pH ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. Thus, the reversed DeltapH did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. However, the DeltapH contributed to alkali tolerance, as the pHmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates DeltapH. Although neutral external-pH values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of @di$ alkali @/di$ tolerance, substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity.	0
lenta infections are usually associated with risk factors, such as malignancies, @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$, surgery, trauma, bed sores, gastrointestinal pathology and hepatobiliary diseases. Our study showed that E. lenta infections are mainly related to digestive tract diseases, which is consistent with the results of Alejandra Ugarte-Torres et al. Three quarters of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ were isolated from blood in our series, including our patient. Although @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ is a part of normal human colonic microbiome, considering its clinical significance when identified in blood cultures, looking for the source and evaluating the patient in detail are advocated. Our patient had liver abscess with perforations in the liver and ascending colon, as well as the resulting abdominal infection, lead to disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and raised the possibility of @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$ translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, it is logical as the source of the patient's infection with @gm$ E. lenta @/gm$.	1
lenta is associated with @di$ bacteremia @/di$ but more recently has been implicated in digoxin metabolism, thereby shaping pharmacologic therapy. Thus it is possible that E. sinensis also alters the IC metabolome and may therefore contribute to alterations in the gut-brain axis or pelvic organ crosstalk. F. prausnitzii is an anaerobe that is highly abundant in the human GI tract. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii provides butyrate to the gut, and F. prausnitzii deficiency is associated with irritable bowel disease. Short chain fatty acids are appreciated as beneficial mediators of the microbiome, and we note that butyrate (a.k.a. butanoate) is one of the top-ranked pathways in the IC fecal metabolome (Fig. 5C). Therefore, F. prausnitzii deficiency may be a major mediator of the IC microbiome. Similarly, @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ deficiency is significantly associated with symptoms in IBS patients.	1

An abundance of Staphylococcus and Faecalibacterium negatively correlates with body mass index (BMI) in CF patients, and increased Alistipes levels impact glucose homeostasis. Some CF patients harbor Clostridioides difficile in stool, often remaining asymptomatic or having nontoxigenic strains. Notably, CF-associated loss of @gm$ Oxalobacter formigenes @/gm$, a microorganism metabolizing oxalates, increases the risk of hyperoxaluria and kidney stone formation.	2
lwoffii, @gm$ Pseudomonas fulva @/gm$ and P. fluorescens. High levels of AMR in sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae is also an emerging global health threat, where the WHO lists antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae as a high-priority pathogen. Pathogenesis and disease progression are dependent on an interplay between bacterial virulence factors and host factors such as immunity, age and nutritional status. Virulence factors promote bacterial colonisation and pathogenesis, where microbial species have evolved mechanisms to invade host cells, evade host immunity and reproduce intracellularly. GNBs possess an array of chromosomal located and acquired factors including adhesins, invasins, outer membrane proteins, toxins such as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxin, capsules, AMR genes and biofilm capabilities amongst others. The LPS endotoxin of Gram-negative species which is released following cell lysis or proliferation is of particular concern due to the development of sepsis or septic shock in patients. The presence of LPS toxin is correlated with @di$ cardiovascular failure @/di$, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation and organ failure in patients. As antibiotic therapy options become increasingly limited for these GNB, prevention of transmission is essential to reduce the spread of such high-risk organisms. Alarmingly, the presence of biocide resistance has emerged in AMR species, where sublethal biocidal exposure proliferates resistance in numerous species. For example, evidence of resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in MDR species due to the presence biocidal resistance genes (BRGs) has emerged, including the qacE and qacA/B genes common in the Enterobacteriaceae family and @gm$ Pseudomonas @/gm$ species.	1

After antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms were not relieved, and the preoperative laboratory examination was unable to identify the infection bacteria. The infectious bacteria were finally identified through surgery and laboratory tests. Our case is characterized by the following points: 1) Salmonella enteritis spondylitis complicated by @gm$ B. melitensis @/gm$ infection is extremely rare; 2) This patient had no obvious gastrointestinal symptoms; 3) All preoperative tests were negative, and pathogens were not detected; 4) Due to atypical manifestations, the patient was originally misdiagnosed as having spinal tuberculosis.	1

merdae, were found to be consistent biomarkers of @di$ RMI @/di$ in additional data sets. One species, namely, @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$, was found to be a biomarker of @di$ UMI @/di$. After further verification, P. merdae and @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$ were removed from this list, as their differential values at least in one of the additional data sets were <0.1, and they did not exhibit differences between the R and NR groups in the log-ratio analysis. Thus, from the list of early identified cross-study taxonomic biomarkers, only B. adolescentis, F. prausnitzii, and E. rectale were reproducible in the Spencer 2021 and Lee 2022 data sets. It is noteworthy that only F. prausnitzii was found to be a predictor of @di$ RMI @/di$ in all seven of the data sets that were included in the analysis and that E. rectale and B. adolescentis were consistent in four of the data sets. Next, we carried out a log-ratio assessment of B. adolescentis, F. prausnitzii, and E. rectale across metagenomes in additional data sets. Since representative biomarkers of @di$ UMI @/di$ were not identified, only taxa with differential values of <-0.5 were selected as a set of denominators.	0

Another group studying the @di$ renal tumor @/di$ microbiota reported @di$ renal tumors @/di$ to have more diverse microbiotas as compared to benign tissue.	0
micdadei, @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ and L. jordanis 186 sputum samples, 43 pleural fluids and bronchial washings and 39 lung tissue samples from 251 pneumonia patients were checked for Legionellae with the direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT). In samples from 201 patients which were negative if tested for antibodies and for urinary antigen and/or using culture methods, the DFAT was negative, too. One Pseudomonas strain isolated from a bronchial washing showed crossreactions. In 19 out of 49 patients with @di$ legionellosis @/di$ L. pneumophila SG 1 (3x), SG 2 (1x), SG 3 (4x), SG 4 (1x), SG 5 (5x), L. micdadei (3x) and @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$ (2x) were found. Positivity of the DFAT was significant higher in specimens, taken in early stages of illness (p less than 0.01). DFAT can be used for specific detection of Legionellae in clinical specimens, but the relative low sensitivity (39%) does not allow to exclude @di$ legionellosis @/di$. Further diagnostic tests like detection of antibodies and urinary antigen and culture are necessary to diagnose @di$ legionellosis @/di$.	1

The combined metabolite and bacterial markers also discriminated @di$ CRA @/di$ from NC with an AUC of 0.6728 (Fig. S11A) and CRC from @di$ CRA @/di$ with an AUC of 0.92 (Fig. S11B). Inclusion of L-asparagine and phenyl lactic acid with 14 @di$ CRA @/di$-versus-NC bacterial markers improved the AUC from 0.8408 to 0.8759 (Fig. 4B). This combination classified CRC from NC with an AUC of 0.8195 (Fig. S11C) and CRC from @di$ CRA @/di$ with an AUC of 0.8976 (Fig. S11D). Furthermore, the combination of alpha-linolenic acid, L-homoserine, phenylacetic acid and phenyl lactic acid with 6 bacterial markers increased AUC from 0.9071 to 0.9375 in classifying CRC from @di$ CRA @/di$ (Fig. 4C). The combination of 10 metabolites and bacterial markers for distinguishing CRC and @di$ CRA @/di$ also classified CRC from NC and @di$ CRA @/di$ from NC, with AUCs of 0.8723 and 0.7499, respectively (Fig. S11E and S11F), demonstrating potential for early diagnosis of @di$ CRA @/di$.	0
mirabilis Hfq positively regulated the expression of crp, as in @gm$ Yersinia @/gm$ . In the normal LB culture condition, the CyaA of P. mirabilis can exist in an active form, catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Once the Crp-cAMP complex was formed, CyaA positively regulated the expression of ptsG, but negatively regulated the expression of hfq and cyaA, possibly by binding to the respective promoter region. In E. coli, extracellular glucose is taken up by the PtsG transporter. High glucose levels inhibit CyaA activity, resulting in decreased cAMP levels and the repression of PtsG, thus forming the feedback regulation of glucose uptake. Our data suggest that the feedback regulation of PtsG by Crp-cAMP in glucose uptake exists in P. mirabilis. Many studies have demonstrated that crp expression must be appropriately controlled to ensure optimal cell physiology. Environmental alterations during @di$ infection @/di$ could serve as signals to activate the TCS or trigger the expression of regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) that influence Crp expression in P. mirabilis. For example, @gm$ Y. pestis @/gm$ crp is regulated by the PhoPQ TCS. Our data suggest that Hfq-dependent sRNAs are likely to posttranscriptionally stimulate Crp synthesis, thereby affecting the expression of the Crp regulons such as pmp during @di$ infection @/di$.	1
mirabilis is one of the most common organisms present during polymicrobial CAUTI, and secondary @di$ bacteremia @/di$ is also frequently polymicrobial, an additional consideration in identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention is the relevance of the target during polymicrobial infection. In our recent investigation of CAUTIs in nursing home residents, the three most common organisms were P. mirabilis, @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ species, and E. coli, and we observed a trend toward certain organisms being more prevalent during polymicrobial CAUTI than as the sole causative agent, specifically, Morganella morganii (71% polymicrobial), @gm$ Enterococcus @/gm$ species (60% polymicrobial), and Providencia stuartii (57% polymicrobial). We therefore investigated d-serine utilization in these other uropathogens, and determined that E. coli and M. morganii are also capable of utilizing d-serine as a sole carbon or nitrogen source and deplete d-serine during incubation in human urine, while P. stuartii and @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ cannot.	1
muciniphila has also been shown to promote inflammation in an animal @di$ colitis @/di$ model.40 Other taxa in the donor microbiota associated with response were Ruminococcaceae including the genus Ruminococcus. Noteworthy, these taxa did not represent Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, also a member of Ruminococcaceae, but matched to Ruminococcus bromii and @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ (Figure S16).	1
muciniphila improved metabolic parameters in @di$ overweight @/di$/obese insulin-resistant humans. Concord grape polyphenols and epigallocatechin gallate from green tea increased A. muciniphila with improved metabolic outcomes. We did not observe any changes in the gut microbiome in the GG-treated group. Like muscle data, the dose we used in this study may not be sufficient to alter gut microbiome composition. Previously, we showed a 800 mg/kg diet of GGOH (vs. 400 mg/kg diet in this study) increased the relative abundance of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum and decreased the abundance of Dorea longicatena compared to the control group. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the dose-response test. @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, another butylate-producing species, was increased with GTPs in high-fat-diet-induced insulin-resistant mice. An increased abundance of @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$ was highly correlated with HDL cholesterol levels and negatively correlated with fat mass and insulin resistance in humans. Previous studies suggested that butyrate-producing bacterial species, such as A. muciniphila and @gm$ S. variabile @/gm$, regulate skeletal muscle metabolism and function; thus, the validation of causality warrants future study.	2
muciniphila resulted in the restoration of mucus thickness that was disrupted in @di$ obese @/di$ and type 2 diabetic mice because of HFD. In addition, this treatment with A. muciniphila was able to improve the metabolic profile and reduce the level of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). High levels of serum LPSs have been linked to gut permeability, and, thus, the disruption of intestinal mucus. Li et al. reported that A. muciniphila reduces atherosclerotic lesions by improving metabolic endotoxemia-induced inflammation through the restoration of the gut barrier. Studies indicate that, despite using mucin as a source of nutrients, A. muciniphila is positively linked to mucus thickness and intestinal barrier integrity in both humans and animals. Moreover, human and animal studies have also shown that A. muciniphila is able to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, in addition to modulating @di$ obesity @/di$ by regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Bodogai et al. reported that the series of inflammatory events that manifest in insulin resistance occur in aged mice as a result of the decrease in abundance of A. muciniphila. This has been linked to the reduction of the mucin layer in the colon, which in turn leads to the loss of butyrate-producing commensal bacteria, such as @gm$ Intestinimonas butyriciproducens @/gm$ (@gm$ I. butyriciproducens @/gm$), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F.	2
muciniphila was associated with glucose control, @di$ inflammation @/di$, and improving the gut barrier. In the Actinobacteria phylum, Bifidobacterium was the main genus in our six samples; the average abundance was below 4%, consistent with previous studies. Depending on the sample studied, we observed different compositions of taxa in the Proteobacteria phylum. This phylum is normally associated with disease states and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The role of this phylum in abnormal physical states has been widely studied, but its contribution to normal conditions is less well known. The main genus in most of the samples was Sutterella. Sutterella spp. have been related to several gastrointestinal disorders, but it is thought that they only have a mild-proinflammatory capacity. However, they keep the immune system alert, due to their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. In this genus, the @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ was the only species which was identified in our study. This bacterium was associated with fat-rich diets and @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$. Emerging studies have suggested that limiting the prevalence of @gm$ B. wadsworthia @/gm$ in the gut microbiome could have a therapeutic effect on metabolic diseases and @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$.	1
muciniphila, could upregulate intestinal tight junctions and reduce high-lipid-mediated @di$ endotoxemia @/di$. Meanwhile, the study of demonstrated that A. muciniphila -mediated reduction of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 levels could be attributed to the induction of intestinal expression of the tight junction proteins, in order to reverse the damage to the gut barrier caused by an HFD which was consistent with our present result (Figure 7). Another species of our great interest is @gm$ Alistipes_senegalensis @/gm$. Studies have confirmed that it is negatively correlated with the progression of chronic liver failure and it was also significantly reduced in the gut microorganisms of Crohn's disease patients, which may suggest that @gm$ Alistipes_senegalensis @/gm$ plays a protective role in chronic kidney disease.	2
multocida-induced BRD symptoms are related to environmental stresses as well as concurrent @di$ viral or @/di$ bacterial infections. Our data provided further evidence that parasitic infections increased the risk of subsequent bacterial infections. Furthermore, as mentioned above, altered @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ abundance may be involved in the compensation by the host for its impaired protein metabolism.	1

It has shown to have antimicrobial activity. From HPTLC analysis it is reported that the major phytochemical present in the crude extract of P. nigrum was found to be piperine thus the inhibitor effect of crude extract of P. nigrum and its active constituent was found to be piperine. C. aurantifolia is popular as fruit and food ingredient for flavoring and adding acidity, its juices have been reported to exhibit antibacterial activity against wide range of microbes including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexnerii, E. coli ATCC 25922 and @gm$ Vibrio cholerae @/gm$ .	0
nucleatum and @gm$ O. splanchnicus @/gm$, which belong to two previously reported genus, Fusobacterium and @gm$ Odoribacter @/gm$, respectively. Moreover, by integrating data on serum proteomic inflammatory markers, this study revealed potential inter-relationships among these microbial species, host inflammation and immune activation, and @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$. In particular, we identified that gut F. nucleatum was positively associated with several serum proteomic markers which might be involved in host inflammation and immune activation related to bacterial infection (e.g., CXCL9, TNFRSF9). Of note, CXCL9 is a known pro-inflammatory chemokine and contributes to host antimicrobial activity against many pathogenic bacteria. CXCL9 is highly expressed in response to infection of some intestinal pathogens (e.g., Citrobacter rodentium), though it is unknown whether expression of CXCL9 can also be induced by F. nucleatum, a proinflammatory pathogenic bacteria which is related to inflammatory bowel disease. TNFRSF9 is also a known proinflammatory marker in tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily which is involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques through T cell activation, and circulating levels of TNFRSF9 could be affected by the alternations of gut microbiota. Our further analysis suggested that the association between F. nucleatum and carotid artery plaque might be partially explained by serum inflammatory markers. This supports the hypothesis that gut microbiota may contribute to @di$ atherosclerosis @/di$ and CVD partially through host inflammation and immune activation pathway.	1

L. garvieae is one of the pathogenic bacteria. had shown that probiotics and Garcinia cambogia extract alleviated weight gain and adiposity in HFD fed mice, in part via differentially modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota, namely, a significant decrease in the relative abundance of L. garvieae. found that the relative abundance of B. coprophilus and B. ovatus dramatically increased in @di$ obese @/di$ patients. also demonstrated that subjects with Crohn's disease had a higher relative abundances of B. ovatus. found the relative abundance of B. ovatus significantly increased in type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated autoimmune children who are at high genetic risk for this disorder compared to non-autoimmune individuals. It is known that B. thetaiotaomicron can decompose many other indigestible dietary plant polysaccharides. found that B. thetaiotaomicron could regulate production of ileal epithelial fucosylated glycans for its own nutritional benefit.

parahaemolyticus typically induces an @di$ inflammatory diarrhea @/di$, whereas epidemic, O1/O139 serogroup V. cholerae infection is characterized by secretory @di$ diarrhea @/di$ with no damage to the intestinal epithelium. Infection by cholera toxin negative, non-O1/non-O139 serogroup V. cholerae strains is historically considered clinically indistinguishable from epidemic strains, but a subset of cases presents with a mild inflammatory component. @gm$ V. mimicus @/gm$ can cause acute gastroenteritis and otitis media after exposure to seawater or contaminated seafood.	1

pasteurianus is an opportunistic pathogen in humans and has been associated with @di$ meningitis @/di$ in piglets. In addition, certain MAGs contained more than one ARG on the same contig, suggesting that the ARGs are linked.

These microorganisms induced well-demarcated, dose-dependent, raised subcutaneous (s.c.) @di$ abscesses @/di$ which were similar in time of onset, lesion progression, and duration of healing. Only viable cells were capable of inducing these characteristic s.c. @di$ abscesses @/di$. Histological examination of the skin lesion 3 and 5 days postinfection revealed @di$ abscess @/di$ formation in the s.c. tissues, and abundant spiral organisms were demonstrated to be present in the @di$ abscess @/di$. Host resistance modulation by dexamethasone (neutrophil alteration) and cyclophosphamide (neutrophil depletion) pretreatment had a minimal effect on the virulence expression by any of these treponemes. The T. denticola isolates demonstrated significant trypsin-like protease (TLPase) activity, while both T. socranskii and @gm$ T. vincentii @/gm$ were devoid of this activity. Interestingly, T. pectinovorum strains were heterogeneous with respect to TLPase as high producers, low producers, and nonproducers. However, no differences in lesion formation were noted regardless of whether the species expressed this proteolytic activity or whether treatment with N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and dithiothreitol was performed. These results showed that (i) a murine model may be used to evaluate virulence expression by oral treponemes; (ii) while TLPase activity varies among the oral treponemes, this protease does not appear to participate in @di$ abscess @/di$ induction in the mouse model; and (iii) T.	1

Of these, 55.6% and 37.5% had @di$ diabetes @/di$ and 27.8% and 18.% were solid organ transplant recipients, respectively. All isolates were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Mortality of infections with R. planticola (n = 5; 15.6%) was higher than for @gm$ R. ornithinolytica @/gm$ (n = 2; 8.0%), but the difference was not statistically significant.	1
plautii based on mouse models revealed it to inhibit the Th2 immune response, TNF-alpha expression and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling, thus, potentially alleviating inflammatory responses in allergic diseases, adipose tissue in @di$ obesity @/di$, and gut inflammation, respectively. Given these diverse observations, F. plautii may contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system in BP leading to the onset or progression of disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of F. plautii in BP disease. Two other notable species of interest include R. lactatiformans and @gm$ A. colihominis @/gm$, which are increased in the BP and BPF groups; interestingly, both were reported to be associated with multiple sclerosis.	2
pneumoniae (n = 5), @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ (n = 4) and E. coli (n = 4). @di$ K. pneumonia @/di$ were detected in each care room, E.Coli and @gm$ E. Cloacae @/gm$ in three of the four care rooms.	1
pneumoniae strains MGH 78578 (multidrug-resistant [MDR] bacterium isolated from a patient with pneumonia), NTUH-K2044 (a hypermucoviscosity (HV)-positive isolate obtained from a patient with @di$ liver abscess @/di$ and meningitis), 342 (N2-fixer plant endophyte still bearing pathogenic potential against mice), HS11286 (MDR clinical isolate), KCTC 2242 (a 2,3-butanediol producer) and 1084 (an HV-negative clinical isolate causing @di$ liver abscess @/di$). Other 115 on-going K. pneumoniae sequencing projects are available as scaffolds/contigs at the NCBI Genome database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/815). The availability of closed genomes is important towards understanding the K. pneumoniae genome plasticity and the evolutionary forces that drive their genetic differentiation and occupation of distinct ecological niches. For instance, Wu et al. showed that the methionine salvage pathway, which might have a role in pathogenesis via oxidative stress, is present in all @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ genomes but not in Escherichia, Salmonella or Shigella, thus providing diversity in virulence mechanisms in pathogenic enterobacteria.	1
pneumoniae, Salmonella, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$, Serratia, Proteus and other Klebsiella species isolated from @di$ BSIs @/di$ exceeded a CFR of 90%, and the standard CZA regimen (2.5g iv q8h) against ESBL-positive K.	1
pneumophila), a species of the @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ genus, is the causative agent of Legionellosis, which contains two forms: the non-pneumonic form (Pontiac fever) and the acute pneumonic form (Legionnaires' disease). Pontiac fever is an influenza-like syndrome. Legionnaires' disease is more severe and can be involved in extrapulmonary manifestation with severe pneumonia, which requires hospitalization and most commonly intensive care. The mortality was 4.6% in medical wards compared with 23.1% in the intensive care unit (ICU). Extrapulmonary manifestations included @di$ abdominal pain @/di$, diarrhea of the digestive system, weakness, and fatigue of the musculoskeletal system, myoglobinuria of the urinary system, malaise of the nervous system, etc.	1
prausnitzii (ATC 27766) improved behavior associated with @di$ anxiety @/di$ and depression, suggesting that this strain can be used as a psychobiotic. In our research, statistically significant decreases in average abundance were observed for species Lachnospira eligens, @gm$ Roseburia hominis @/gm$, and Roseburia intestinalis in the microbiota of patients with depression, whereas the species Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans and Escherichia coli showed elevated abundances. Species R. intestinalis, like F. prausnitzii, are among the most prevalent butyrate-producing commensal bacteria. Metabolites of @gm$ R. hominis @/gm$, propionate and butyrate, can stimulate synthesis of melatonin in the intestine by increasing 5-HT levels and promoting p-CREB-mediated transcription of Aanat gene.	2
prausnitzii A2-165 and Dorea longicatena were negatively correlated with markers for @di$ insulin resistance @/di$, whereas Ruminococcus torques, Clostridium bolteae, Eubacterium ramulus and @gm$ Bilophila wadsworthia @/gm$ were positively correlated (Supplementary Table S1).	1
prausnitzii and @gm$ Bifidobacterium catenulatum @/gm$, with fructooligosaccharides as an energy source, resulted in the greatest viable cell-count and butyrate production increases. Further, the co-culture supernatant reduced the amount of proinflammatory cytokines produced by HT-29 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages, an effect that was similar to that of butyrate. Furthermore, feeding mice both Faecalibacterium and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ enhanced F. prausnitzii gut colonization. Finally, feeding the co-culture supernatant decreased interleukin 8 levels in the colon and increased butyrate levels in the cecum in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced @di$ colitis @/di$ mouse model. These observations indicate that the Faecalibacterium-@gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ co-culture exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting F.	2
prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$. An increased presence of Ruminococcaceae UCG 005 was reported in @di$ acute coronary syndrome @/di$ compared to the healthy control group, as well as increased serum trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentration.	1
prausnitzii exhibits an anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ effect; specifically, its metabolites possess the ability to inhibit NF-B activation and IL-8 secretion, which are strongly linked to @di$ intestinal inflammation @/di$. Thus, reducing the abundance of F. prausnitzii may result in a high risk of IBD relapse and a reduced duration of remission. Finally, The abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri is reduced following PPI use. L. reuteri has the ability to convert the histidine present in food to histamine. Then, histamine increases cAMP levels by activating histamine receptors (H2); next, cAMP inhibits downstream MEK/ERK-MAPK signaling via protein kinase A and suppresses the production of TNF-alpha, a key driving factor for @di$ chronic inflammation @/di$ in IBD. Therefore, a decrease in @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ royi may also contribute to IBD development.	2
prausnitzii has been related to a variety of diseases, including @di$ obesity @/di$, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, Vallianou et al. found a significant reduction in F. prausnitzii. Thus, increasing F. prausnitzii levels may also be beneficial in preventing the development of NAFLD in @di$ obese @/di$ patients. Recently, a study demonstrated that mice on a high-fat diet given F. prausnitzii suspensions made in an anaerobic environment have decreased liver fat. F. prausnitzii is anaerobic and dies quickly after being exposed to air, so it is challenging to replenish F. prausnitzii directly. Interactions between gut microbiota are possible, the theoretical underpinnings of gut microbiota interactions include metabolite stimulation, direct stimulation or inhibition, and host effect. Previously, it was found that B. uniformis and @gm$ B. thetaiotaomicron @/gm$ may work in conjunction to reduce weight. It has previously been demonstrated that different gut microbiota encourages the growth of F. prausnitzii, for instance, B. thetaiomicron and F. prausnitzii co-cultured organisms create butyric acid, which aids in the growth of F. prausnitzii. Therefore, it might be also possible to raise the level of F. prausnitzii by promoting the number of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium butyricum, and Eubacterium rectale colonies while decreasing the number of Enterobacteriaceae colonies.	2

One group of mice was directly inoculated with ~109 CFU of V. cholerae at the same time they received the 14-member community to simulate the rapidly expanding V. cholerae population during @di$ diarrhea @/di$ (""D1invasion"" group)."	1
prausnitzii, @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$ (Ze et al.,), was less frequently found in the patients' groups, particularly in CHA and ERLD samples. R. champanellensis is the only human colonic bacterium reported to be capable of degrading crystalline cellulose and fermentation of dietary non-digestible carbohydrates. It has important consequences for health via modulation of microbiota composition by supplying energy and supporting microbial growth (Chassard et al.,; Ben David et al.,). A study of fecal microbiota of children with @di$ autism @/di$ and PDD-NOS revealed that Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Eubacteriaceae were found to be present at the lowest level in fecal samples of children with @di$ autism @/di$ (De Angelis et al.,), which is in accordance with our results.	2

A. butyriciproducens is a butyrate-producing microbe, while @gm$ C. catus @/gm$ produces both butyrate and propionate. We also observed broader, community-wide differences between subjects with @di$ ET @/di$, PV, and MF. Notably, the microbiome composition of MF subjects was more dissimilar to each other when compared to @di$ ET @/di$ and PV. Our previous work comparing the gut microbiome composition of healthy and MPN subjects similarly showed that individuals with MF had increased beta-dispersion when compared to @di$ ET @/di$ and PV.	0
predominated in @di$ abscesses @/di$, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in @di$ abscesses @/di$, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, @di$ abscesses @/di$, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and @gm$ Peptostreptococcus prevotii @/gm$ (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, @di$ abscesses @/di$, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in @di$ abscesses @/di$ and abdominal and OBG infections.	1
present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with @di$ eczema @/di$ and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (HOPE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. The relative abundances of Bifidobacterium longum and @gm$ B. catenulatum @/gm$ with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; P value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. In contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ against the total amplified 16S rRNA genes and those of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, and B. breve against the genus @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; P value, <0.066).	0

psittaci + H9N2 + @gm$ ORT @/gm$/A. fumigatus. Similarly, post-inoculation with 2 or 3 pathogens in SPF chickens could lead to the same symptoms with a milder degree. The respiratory signs and mortality rates were characterized as those seen in the clinical outbreak of seasonal avian pneumonia in broiler poultry under cold temperature. No deaths occurred in the birds infected with C. psittaci/A. fumigatus, H9N2/A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus conidia alone, and these chickens only suffered from transient respiratory distresses. In a previous record, no clinical signs and mortality rates were noted in SPF chickens whereas more than 50% of mortality rate was occurred in broilers by aerosol inoculation with A. fumigatus . The results of the present study might suggest that co-infection with C. psittaci, H9N2, @gm$ ORT @/gm$ and A. fumigatus are responsible for the current severe airsacculitis with high mortality rates in commercial broilers. It is the first time that clinical airsacculitis has been well replicated using the above clinical four pathogenic isolates in a SPF chicken model. A post-mortem examination implied that C. psittaci and @gm$ ORT @/gm$ infection targeted both air sacs and lungs while H9N2 infection induced upper @di$ airway lesions @/di$ at the junctions of the primary and secondary bronchi and lungs in comparison with the lung damage caused by an A.	1

pylori-infected children and their relationship with @di$ hypochlorhydria @/di$ and iron deficiency (ID). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study of 123 symptomatic children. At endoscopy, antral biopsies were taken for urease test, pathology and culture and blood for analysis of ferritin, transferrin, serum iron, and total iron-binding capacity. Polymorphisms in the IL-1beta cluster (positions -511, -31, +3954, ILRN) were determined by PCR-RFLP. Gastric mucosal expression of IL-1beta mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: After exclusions, of 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were @gm$ H. pylori @/gm$ positive. Nine (8.6%) children were classified as iron deficient (ID). @gm$ Helicobacter pylori @/gm$ positivity was associated with ID (OR: 5.1; 95% CI: 1.2-21.9) (p = .04).	1
rectale and @gm$ C. eutactus @/gm$ within a fecal biofilm can cause increased vascular dissemination of specific molecules that would then affect the striatum. Not only that, but others have suggested that in order to address @di$ obesity @/di$, rather than focusing on expending more calories, we should focus on attempting to make the brain crave less food. An example of this comes from a food-craving study in pregnancy that found an association with key components of the dopaminergic mesolimbic circuit, namely with the upregulation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) expression, and activity of D2R neurons. As food craving has long-lasting effects on offspring, such as glucose intolerance, @di$ obesity @/di$, and anxiety disorders even into adulthood, the study suggests that rather than having E. rectale and @gm$ C. eutactus @/gm$ be present in the gut to promote exercise, it would be better if they were absent, given that they might increase food-craving.	1

"report that, following @di$ oral infection @/di$, @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ is effectively internalized only in microfold cells (M cells), attributing to them the role of ""gateway"" for this bacterium, which uses PrPc located on their apical surface as an uptake receptor. The same investigators have additionally reported that PrPc plays an important role in the uptake of @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$ by macrophages. Another study showed an upregulation of PrPc mRNA in murine bone marrow cell cultures challenged with Escherichia coli in the early stages of bacterial infection. The PrPc-encoding gene (PRNP) could also interact with the transcription factors of heat shock proteins (HSPs). For example, when @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp. invades phagocytes, HSPs have been reported to promote the aggregation of PrPc on their surface; moreover, PrPc has been reported to colocalize with the growth factor protein Grb2, which initiates the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and regulates the control of signaling pathways. Microglial cells are phagocytes clustered in the brain, which can be activated during brain trauma, @di$ infections @/di$, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although they are known to become activated in the early stages of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the functional relationships between microglia and PrPc remain unclear; however, the activation of these cells is accompanied by a downregulation of the expression of the PRNP gene and it also appears that, during @di$ infection @/di$ or in degenerative CNS disorders, this could promote the conversion of PrPc into PrPSc."	1

salivarius F286 and @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ F278 may exert regulatory (anti-inflammatory) roles in gut immunity, and S. salivarius F286 can modulate gut microbiota at weaning. Our results suggest that the two milk Streptococcus strains have probiotic potential and might be able to enhance host immune tolerance at early life and resistance to inflammatory pathologies in adulthood, and therefore warrant further study on the preventing/treating effects of milk S. salivarius and @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$ strains on inflammatory pathologies such as @di$ colitis @/di$ and allergic inflammation.	2
salivarius, @gm$ L. helveticus @/gm$, L. delbrueckii, E. xiangfangensis, and A. baumannii were identified in all the specimens, accounting for 39.72%.

scindens, and @gm$ C. sordellii @/gm$). Due to a lack of redundancy in this system, any perturbations to the 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria are likely to induce an imbalance in the ratio between secondary and primary BAs and impact hepatic function. Although two taxa of Clostridium were found to be enriched in the infants with CJ, their identification to the species level could not be accurately determined based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions. Thus, further investigations of the microbiome profile with shotgun metagenomic sequencing are needed to identify the exact species that shift 7alpha-dehydroxylation during @di$ cholestasis @/di$.	1
sciuri (n = 3) and @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ (n = 3), whilst others were S. warneri (n = 2) and S. cohnii (n = 1). A similar study conducted in pig farms also recovered methicillin-resistant strains of these species in addition to Staphylococcus lentus (Rattanamuang, Butr-Indr & Anukool). Staphylococcus sciuri colonises the skin and nares of humans and animals (Shittu et al.) and is associated with human infections including urinary tract infections (UTI), endocarditis, peritonitis and wound infections (Couto et al.). It could also be implicated in fatal exudative epidermitis in piglets (Chen et al.). Staphylococcus warneri colonises the skin of both animals and humans and occasionally causes septicaemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis and other types of infections occurring in immunocompromised individual or patients with invasive treatment procedure. In humans, @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ could be implicated in UTI and more rarely, in endocarditis, pyelonephritis or @di$ pneumonia @/di$ (Becker et al.).	1

The patient was treated successfully with the combination of isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and ofloxacin. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of an extensively disseminated infection due to @gm$ M. scrofulaceum @/gm$ in an immunocompetent host since the advent of AIDS.	1
sequenced the microbial 16S rRNA genes of fecal samples of three different subgroups divided according to their glucose intolerance status (normal tolerance, @di$ prediabetes @/di$ and T2DM individuals). This study showed that every progressive stage of the development of diabetes is related to a specific change in the composition of the gut microbiota. Glucose tolerance decreases along with the presence of butyrate producing bacteria such as A. muciniphila and Fecalibacterium prausnitzii and is also associated with a decrease of Verrucomicrobiae. The abundance of @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ continued to decrease together with the glucose tolerance increase. These results suggest that the composition of gut microbiota could be potential marker for a high risk of DM, and the conservation of gut microbiota homeostasis in the @di$ prediabetes @/di$ stage may be a strategy to delay the development of the pathology.	2

The majority of the members of the genus Pediococcus are used in the food and drink industry as starter and probiotic cultures as well as food spoilers. @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ has been intensively investigated and widely employed for food preservation due to its ability to produce antimicrobial agents. Additionally, several strains of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ have been shown to reduce inflammation, encephalopathy, obesity and @di$ fatty liver @/di$ in animals. Although food is the main source of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ for humans, the strains of @gm$ P. pentosaceus @/gm$ adapted to the gastrointestinal tract are dissimilar from those found in food because the former may originate from sub-populations present in food at low numbers that exhibit special adaptive properties.	2
strains 3BBH6, 5CBH24, and 5CPEGH6 and @gm$ A. shahii @/gm$), O. splanchnicus, and Christensenellaceae_R-7, was uniquely associated with clinical remission after FMT. Among these, Faecalibacterim, Butyricimonas, and Alistipes are well-known SCFA-producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory commensal bacteria that play a role in IBD, @di$ obesity @/di$, appendectomy, and depression.	2
strains were isolated from samples of coots and song @di$ thrush @/di$. @gm$ Campylobacter @/gm$ was not detected in other tested bird species. Of the 59 Campylobacter spp. isolates, 36 were identified at species level (spectral scores >= 2.000) by MALDI-TOF MS. For the remaining 23 isolates, MALDI-TOF MS was able to identify only genus level (spectral scores between 1,700 and 1,999). In this study, 93% of coots (41/44) were colonized by thermophilic Campylobacter spp., of which all isolates (n = 53) except for one were identified as @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ by species differentiating real-time PCR. Song thrushes carried thermophilic Campylobacter spp. at a lower prevalence of 5.2% (6/116). Five of the six isolates were identified as C. jejuni. After initial identification, three isolates (two C. jejuni and one Campylobacter spp.) from song thrushes and one @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ isolates from coot did not survive in the stock and were not analyzed further.	0
striatum is the most common species identified in @di$ PJI @/di$ cases, while C. jeikeium, C. amycolatum, C. tuberculostearicum and C. simulans were less prevalent. Recently, @gm$ Odoribacter splanchnicus @/gm$ was described as a new uncommon anaerobes linked to a rare case of @di$ PJI @/di$ in an 82-year-old woman diagnosed with hip infection.	1

suis and @gm$ B. abortus @/gm$, which are more frequently reported as underlying cause of human brucellosis. Less attention has been paid to B. canis in Europe, although dogs usually live in close contact with their owners and there is an increasing incidence of dog trafficking and import of puppies from breeding kennels with poor state of health. An increasing number of case reports describes B. canis infections in people, especially in immunocompromized adults or children. Clinically conspicuous humans exhibit unspecific signs like undulant fever, fatigue, @di$ weakness @/di$, lymphadenopathy, liver and spleen enlargement.	1
suis in dogs has been extrapolated from @gm$ B. canis @/gm$, which also causes abortion, orchitis/epididymitis, discospondylitis, septic arthritis, meningoencephalitis, @di$ uveitis @/di$ and lymphadenopathy in dogs. @gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$ is highly transmissible.	1
thermophilum, @gm$ B. merycicum @/gm$, and B. magnum in PFM consumers seem to be due to the intake of Bifidobacterium-containing PFM, probably B. animalis strains, which are the most common species found in PFM products. Therefore, it seems that the intake of B. animalis strains might modulate phylogenetically close species almost absent in the study subjects and B. animalis levels itself, agreeing with other studies. Despite B. animalis being considered a transient microorganism due to the low recovery in both fecal and mucosal samples, current evidence has pointed out its beneficial effects on the immune and gastrointestinal systems of healthy adults when administered in probiotic products. However, the lack of evidence available about the presence and function of B. pseudolongum, B. thermophilum, @gm$ B. merycicum @/gm$, and B. magnum in humans, along with the nonzero probability of Illumina sequencing errors in base-calling as well as in reads alignment, which indeed might lead to OTU allocation errors between phylogenetically close species, impels us to be cautious about the association found between these species and the intake of PFM that contain B. animalis. Likewise, the consumption of yogurt was also associated to higher levels of the yogurt starter S. thermophilus, which has been related to probiotic properties in @di$ lactose intolerance @/di$ conditions due to its beta-galactosidase activity, as well as possibly to the reduction of gastrointestinal and allergy symptoms.	2

Isolation of invasive serotypes such as S. typhimurium indicates the public health significance and may pose health hazards, especially if chicken is consumed undercooked or cross-contamination occurs in kitchen during the meal preparation. The dominated serotype was S. thampson, which might be due to cross-contamination during product handling and distribution. Infection with S. thampson causes @di$ diarrhea @/di$, nausea and vomiting in humans as well as several diseases in immune-compromised individuals.	1

ulcerans is thought to have evolved from @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ by acquiring this virulence conferring plasmid. @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ is an atypical mycobacterium that causes infections in fishes and humans. Human infections may occur following exposure to aquatic environments and animals (fish and aquatic bugs). However, @gm$ M. marinum @/gm$ infections are minor and are characterized by intracellular bacteria and @di$ granulomatous lesions @/di$.	1
uniformis has the potential to prevent and/or treat inflammation-related diseases such as digestive tract inflammation-related diseases such as ulcerative colitis, @di$ gastritis @/di$ and gastroenteritis, as well as cardiovascular diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the colon cancer in the patients leads to the significant decrease of in the intestinal of M. uniformis patients suffered from colon cancer. It is true that there are significant differences in the gut microflora between gouty patients and healthy people. The gut bacteria of gouty patients are rich in bacteria such as Bacteroides caccae and @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, while the other two species (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bi dobacterium pseudocatenulatum) are absent in patients suffered from gouty.	0
upsaliensis and that of patient 2 was @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$. While the most common clinical features of C. jejuni and C. coli are @di$ diarrhea @/di$, vomiting and fever in healthy individuals, C. upsaliensis and @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ lead to more severe complications, especially in patients with underlying diseases. C. upsaliensis bacteremia is sometimes observed in normal hosts and in opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals, and it has been associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and with postinfectious polyneuropathy. C. upsaliensis has also been isolated from extraintestinal sites, including a breast abscess and fetoplacental material from a spontaneous human abortion. Patient 1 suffered from ADPKD and it is thought that renal cystitis was brought by C. upsaliensis via the blood stream. This is the first reported instance of renal cystitis by C. upsaliensis. @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ has also been considered as an opportunistic pathogen since most of the affected patients have had an underlying chronic illness, such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and immunodeficiency. @gm$ C. fetus @/gm$ infections have been reported in severe clinical settings, including bacteremia, septic abortions, meningoencephalitis, motor neuron paralysis, brain abscess, sudural empyema, septic arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, lung abscess, peritonitis and cholecystitis.	1

These species have been associated with serious infections, and may be considered emerging pathogens. Indeed, A. lwoffii represents 61% of the isolates of Acinetobacter spp. other than A. baumannii, and the available information indicates that these isolates are combined with clinical symptoms of sepsis, @di$ bacteremia @/di$, pyrexia, meningitis, post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, rigors, pneumonia, cellulitis, rash, ophthalmia neonatum, urinary tract infection, and abscess. Moreover, some authors (Tega et al.,) reported the isolation of multi drug resistance A. lwoffii strains in cases of catheter-related @di$ bacteremia @/di$, and @di$ bacteremia @/di$ has been associated to gastroenteritis (Regalado et al.,).	1

used metagenomics and metabolomics studies to characterize the gut microbiota of patients with NAFLD-associated cirrhosis, with or without @di$ HCC @/di$. They found that the increased abundance of Bacteroides caecimuris and Veillonella parvula in NAFLD-@di$ HCC @/di$ patients distinguished them from NAFLD-cirrhosis patients. Five bacteria were enriched in NAFLD-@di$ HCC @/di$ (B. caecimuris, Veillonella parvula, Clostridium bolteae, @gm$ Bacteroides xylanisolvens @/gm$, and Ruminococcus gnavus) and all were found to produce SCFAs. Accordingly, metabolomics data showed that feces from NAFLD-@di$ HCC @/di$ patients were enriched with SCFAs: acetate, butyrate, and formate.	1
variabilis) NIPH 546 (86.76%), and @gm$ A. lwoffii @/gm$ CIP 61.10T (86.39%), while A. qingfengsis strain 2BJ1T revealed the least closely related rpoB sequence (76.01%). When generating a phylogenetic tree employing all published rpoB sequences from A. indicus-like strains (accessed at 29th December 2016), our bovine isolates clustered with human clinical A. indicus-like strain LUH10523 (99.88% nucleotide sequence identity) that was obtained from the blood culture of a patient in The Netherlands in 2005 (Fig 2). Next closely related was A. indicus-like strain CIP 53.82 that was obtained from a human patient with @di$ postoperative meningitis @/di$ in 1953 in France.	0
vulgatus and some fiber-degrading taxa (e.g., Roseburia CAG_471, @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$; Fig. 1a). However, when evaluating the differences associated with the type of allergy, we also identified some allergy-specific signatures. Children with FA showed a microbial pattern characterized by decreased abundance of B. vulgatus, and higher levels of Blautia wexlerae compared with RA (p < 0.05; Fig. 1b). In contrast, Anaerostipes hadrus and Prevotella copri were higher in subjects with RA compared with both CT and FA patients (Fig. 1b). Since we recently demonstrated the presence of at least 12 different species within Faecalibacterium genus, we used the same pipeline to test the occurrence of F. prausnitzii clades in the samples. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii clade A (that includes, among others, the strain L2-6, previously linked with @di$ atopic dermatitis @/di$) was enriched in FA, compared with both RA and CT (chi-squared test, p < 0.05).	1
vulgatus were the strongest driver species for the positive association between HOMA-IR and microbial branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) biosynthesis in Danish individuals without @di$ diabetes @/di$ and further found that P. copri caused insulin resistance and impaired glucose intolerance by changing the circulating serum levels of BCAAs in mice. Transplantation of B. vulgatus resulted in insulin resistance in recipient mice. Therefore, these two bacteria may have contributed to a high level of insulin resistance in clusters 2 and 3 in our work. Furthermore, we also found a high abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus ASV4377 in clusters 2 and 3. Studies reported that R. gnavus is a mucin-degrading bacterium that may directly break the integrity of gut barrier and is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. The disruption of gut barrier may lead to the translocation of endotoxins produced by gut bacteria to the host. In our study, the level of LBP, a load marker of gut-derived antigens, was higher in clusters 2 and 3, which suggested an increased level of plasma endotoxin load produced by gut bacteria. The increased circulating endotoxin load would induce chronic inflammation, which is a driving factor for insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Thus, the disordered gut microbiome, such as increased levels of R. gnavus, may contribute to the insulin resistance and dyslipidemia by disrupting gut barrier, elevating circulated endotoxin load, and inducing chronic inflammation. Moreover, cluster 1 enriched the ASVs belonging to @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$. Some species of @gm$ Barnesiella @/gm$ have been reported to produce acetate. In addition, high levels of acetate and butyrate concentration, as well as the functional genes involved in the production of these metabolites were observed in cluster 1. Studies have revealed that acetate suppresses body fat accumulation and inflammation in obese or @di$ diabetic @/di$ rodents through multiple mechanisms.	2

Hence, it is assumed that the persistent Campylobacter infection leading to prolonged inflammatory reaction resulted in the development of myometrial abscess. Campylobacter spp., mainly C. jejuni and @gm$ C. coli @/gm$ are the important etiological agents causing abortion as well as severe gastroenteritis in humans. Among slaughtered goat meat, there is 73% contamination by @gm$ Campylobacter coli @/gm$ and 12% by C.	1

A majority of these taxa have previously reported positive health associations including production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and anti-inflammatory properties as well as negative associations with diseases like type 2 diabetes and @di$ colorectal cancer @/di$. F. prausnitzii had also been negatively associated with frailty onset in the elderly. In contrast, the DietNegative OTUs mainly belonged to Ruminococcus torques, Collinsella aerofaciens, Coprococcus comes, Dorea formicigenerans, Clostridium ramosum, Veillonella dispar, Flavonifractor plautii and Actinomyces lingnae. Increase in the abundances of R. torques, C. aerofaciens, C. ramosum and V. dispar have been associated with type 2 diabetes and @di$ colorectal cancer @/di$, atherosclerosis, cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease.	2
