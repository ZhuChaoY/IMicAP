@di$ ABM @/di$ remained a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Guatemalan children before the introduction of Hib and @gm$ Spn @/gm$ vaccines in 2005 and 2012, respectively. More than half of the children with @di$ ABM @/di$ died or had major morbidity by hospital discharge.	2
@di$ Dysbiosis @/di$ or disturbance of the intestinal microflora is a term used to describe the disturbance of the natural balance of microorganisms in the digestive tract. The disturbance results from a decrease in the proportion of beneficial microorganisms, an overgrowth of potentially harmful microorganisms or a decrease in overall microbiological diversity. The effect of quercetin supplementation on the suppression of @di$ dysbiosis @/di$ of the intestinal microbiota, caused by a diet high in sucrose and fat has been demonstrated. Quercetin reduced the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (markers of intestinal health) and inhibited the growth of Erysipelotrichaceus, Bacillus, and @gm$ Eubacterium cylindroides @/gm$ bacteria (bacterial species associated with diet-induced obesity).	2
@di$ Mycobacterium chelonei infection @/di$ developed at the insertion site of an indwelling Broviac catheter in a child with erythroleukemia. Direct adherence to and colonization of the intra- and extra-luminal surfaces of the catheter, with extension to the adjacent subcutaneous tissue, by this rapidly growing @gm$ mycobacterium @/gm$ may have been the primary factor underscoring the infection. Nontuberculous mycobacteria such as @gm$ Mycobacterium chelonei @/gm$ grow readily on routine bacteriologic media and resemble Corynebacterium spp.	1
@di$ Typhoid fever @/di$ is a significant public health problem with annual estimates of 22 million cases and 216,000 deaths worldwide, although the global burden is known to be underestimated, especially in developing countries where the majority of cases likely remain undiagnosed. @di$ Typhoid fever @/di$ is caused by @gm$ Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi @/gm$ (@gm$ S. Typhi @/gm$, a Gram-negative bacterium, transmitted by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water. Culture from blood or stool remains the gold standard for @di$ typhoid @/di$ diagnosis, but these methods may not be affordable or practical in low-resource settings, where serological methods have historically been used to diagnose @di$ typhoid infection @/di$. Even when culture is available, these methods can result in low recovery of the organism (40% blood, 37% stool) and are complicated by the use of antibiotics prior to specimen collection. Clinical presentation varies from a mild illness with low grade fever, malaise and dry cough to a severe clinical picture with abdominal discomfort, altered mental status and multiple complications. If not treated, @di$ typhoid fever @/di$ may progress to severe complications like delirium, intestinal haemorrhage, bowel perforation, and death.	1
@gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp. are generally considered a part of the normal flora of the skin, mucous membranes or the pharynx, and human respiratory secretions and are accountable for a wide variety of local and systemic @di$ infections @/di$, including pneumonia, septicemia and wound infections. The main body areas populated by these microorganisms in hospitalized patients are the skin, oropharynx, and digestive tract. In a study conducted by, @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ spp.	1
@gm$ Brucella @/gm$ genus, including Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, @gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$, and Brucella suis, is the etiologic agent of a zoonotic infectious disease called human brucellosis with up to 500,000 new cases annually. Most cases were identified in the Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, Mexico, the Arabian peninsula, South and Central America, India, and Central Asia. Humans @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ infection is defined by an undulant fever because of the fixation of infected macrophages in particular localization inside the body such as bones and spleen. Brucellosis causes some disorders like arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, and @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$. @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ bacterium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that resists killing by neutrophil cells.	1
@gm$ Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis @/gm$. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to @di$ metabolic disorders @/di$ (anorexia, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer).	1
@gm$ Shigella dysenteriae @/gm$ was the most commonly isolated micro-organism, found in the stools of 5 patients. Complications occurred in 8 patients (33%) in the acute phase, 5 (21%) had generalized tonic-clonic seizures, while 2 (8%) had depressed level of consciousness. Three of the patients who had generalized seizures developed permanent cortical blindness. One patient developed chronic renal failure. One patient (4%) died in the acute phase after prolonged generalised seizure and @di$ coma @/di$. The mean age of the group with complications was 3335 months while it was 41:03 months in the uncomplicated group and mean platelets count was 46+-40 x 10(9)/L and 58 +- 35 x 10(9)/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Males seem to be more affected than females and @gm$ Shigella @/gm$ was the most commonly isolated organism.	1
@gm$ Streptococcus suis @/gm$ (@gm$ S. suis @/gm$) can cause many symptoms, such as septicemia, meningitis, arthritis, and endocarditis in both humans and pigs and is associated with high mortality. Based on incomplete data, since the first case was described in Denmark in 1968, over 1600 human cases of @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infection have been reported. In Asia, this pathogen affects the general population and is of significant public health concern. Among all the known @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotypes, @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ serotype 2 (SS2) is the most prevalent in both pigs and humans and is often reported worldwide. @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ is also an important pathogen that causes meningitis in Vietnam, Thailand, and Hong Kong. During July and August of 2005, a sudden outbreak of 215 human cases @gm$ S. suis @/gm$ infection was described in Sichuan province, where Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS) caused by this bacterium was reported to cause severe symptoms, such as acute high fever, @di$ hypotension @/di$, shock, blood spots, and dysfunction of multiple organs.	1
@gm$ Vibrio mimicus @/gm$ is a Gram-negative bacterium that is closely related to V. cholerae and causes gastroenteritis characterized by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and @di$ fever @/di$ due to contaminated fish consumption and seafood.	1
A balanced evaluation for adult patients hospitalized for @di$ pneumonia @/di$ is that M. pneumoniae is probably present in 5-8% of patients (second bacterial pathogen in frequency after S. pneumoniae) and @gm$ Legionella @/gm$ spp.	1
A case of nervous signs in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) associated with a severe otitis and @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ is reported. The outbreak was characterized by abnormal head position, torticollis and difficulty in standing, walking and flying. Pathological, microbiological and molecular genetic data supported an association with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) infection. Clinical signs persisted for several days and were accompanied by weight loss leading to death. Morbidity was approximately 20% and most birds died if untreated. Lesions were mainly characterized by a severe @di$ osteomyelitis @/di$ of the cranial bones and purulent inflammation of the external, middle and inner ears. @gm$ O. rhinotracheale @/gm$ was isolated from ear samples, skull and brain stem in pure culture.	1
A feature of obesity appears to be an increase in the SCFA producer @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ which could provide more energy to the host. However, @gm$ Roseburia @/gm$ are decreased relative to controls in type 2 diabetes and in animal models on high-fat diets. They are also reduced in IBD. As such, there exists not only differences but also similarities in dysbiosis of obesity and IBD. In IBD, the microbial dysbiosis is more characteristic. Joosens et al. identified five characteristic bacterial changes in @di$ Crohn's disease @/di$. The pattern reported in @di$ CD @/di$ included a decrease in Dialister invisus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, F. prausnitzii and a species of Clostridium cluster XIV (not further specified here) and increased R. gnavus. In UC, while F. prausnitzii is found to be decreased, there is also a reduction of Roseburia hominis which is different from the dysbiosis of @di$ CD @/di$ where @gm$ Roseburia (inulinivorans) @/gm$ is identified.	1
A promising approach is the use of AI-2 analogs like D-ribose that block the AI-2 pathway and inhibit @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ virulence. Wang et al showed in a rat model of mechanical ventilation that co-inoculation of @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ and Streptococcus mitis resulted in increased biomass, lung damage, and rat mortality compared to @di$ infection @/di$ with only @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ (Wang et al.,). Treatment with D-ribose of both the single and dual species infections showed a significant decrease in biomass and lowering of rat mortality in the latter group due to interference with AI-2 signaling (Wang et al.,). Inhibition of @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$ virulence is not only beneficial because the @gm$ P. aeruginosa @/gm$-mediated damage is reduced but also because the immune system is less stimulated (Figure 1).	1
A single pathogen, the anaerobic bacterium @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$, which was most likely to be the cause of @di$ pneumonia @/di$, was recovered by several in-depth microbiological studies with proper transportation and the right conditions for growth. Also, it is important to mention that the patient relapsed after two years to another purulent lung infection during which surgery was performed, resected abscesses in the lungs and microbiological examinations isolated @gm$ Anaerococcus prevotii @/gm$.	1
Abundance of the species @gm$ Blautia hydrogenotrophica @/gm$ was lower in pre-DM subjects, while XOS increased its abundance. In Pre-DM, XOS showed a tendency to reduce OGTT 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.13), but had no effect on body composition, HOMA-IR, serum glucose, triglyceride, satiety hormones, and TNFalpha. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical observation of modifications of the gut microbiota by XOS in both healthy and Pre-DM subjects in a pilot study. Prebiotic XOS may be beneficial in reversing changes in the gut microbiota during the development of @di$ diabetes @/di$.	0
Acetate is mainly produced by Streptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium spp., and Akkermansia muciniphila, while propionate is synthesized by Bacteroides spp., Salmonella spp., Dialister spp., Veillonella spp., Roseburia inulinivorans, @gm$ Coprococcus catus @/gm$, and Blautia obeum, and butyrate is produced by the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Acidaminococcaceae families (Table 1). These compounds can either be defecated or taken up by the gut epithelium and they impact numerous cellular processes, i.e., (1) intensify the production of interleukin-18 (IL-18), which is involved in maintaining and restoring epithelial integrity and intestinal barrier permeability, (2) prevent autoinflammation and @di$ carcinogenesis @/di$, (3) influence appetite regulation and energy intake, (4) influence hepatic lipid and glucose homeostasis, and (5) influence the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, which modulate the gut and peripheral immune responses, and maintain tolerance to self-antigens (Fig.	2
aeruginosa PAO1, @gm$ S. enterica Serovar Enteritidis @/gm$, Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1A1 and Endozoicomonas sp. HEX311 LPS. Other sugars (amino sugars, uronic acids) were not identified here. Glucose (Glc), rhamnose (Rha), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man) and arabinose (Ara) residues were determined by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) among the four strains. Glc was identified in PAO1, SE CIP and Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1A1, Rha in PAO1, SE CIP and Endozoicomonas sp. HEX311. Man was only present in SE @di$ CIP @/di$, whereas LPS from Endozoicomonas sp.	0
Although direct iron supplementation is currently used to alleviate @di$ anemia @/di$ associated with IBD, global iron excess often leads to iron-mediated oxidative stress and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. As demonstrated in the DSS-induced colitis model, the unique abilities of pentanoate to promote iron procurement and Treg homeostasis alleviated both iron deficiencies and intestinal inflammation. Pentanoate is produced by intestinal commensal bacteria such as @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$; thus, either direct pentanoate supplementation or modulation of @gm$ Megasphaera @/gm$ messiliensis could be helpful for improving both the enteric conditions and nonenteric conditions of patients with IBD.	0
Among five @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ species, Acb (@gm$ Acinetobacter calcoaceticus @/gm$-A. baumannii) complex was one of the most predominating species (51.5%) in this study, which was comparable to the findings of other studies. It suggests Acb complex has more survival rate even in an unfavorable environment and causes hospital acquired @di$ infection @/di$. About 20% of isolates were obtained from ICU which is similar to findings reported in the previous study from Nepal. This indicates that ICU could be the most important location for the colonization and survival of @gm$ Acinetobacter @/gm$ in at hospital environment.	1
Among others, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus gasseri, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Blautia producta, were more abundant in IBD, while @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, Bacteroides fragilis, and Streptococcus salivarius were depleted. Fornelos et al. observed that certain N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), such as LEA, PEA, OEA and AEA, are elevated in the stool of IBD, @di$ Crohn's disease @/di$, and/or ulcerative colitis patients, and stimulate the growth of bacterial species overrepresented in IBD while inhibiting bacterial species lacking in IBD. N-acylethanolamine levels were highest in samples with most differences in the microbiome, suggesting a connection between N-acylethanolamines and altered microbiota in IBD. These researchers observed that LEA inhibited the growth of Bacteroides fragilis, @gm$ Bacteroides cellulosilyticus @/gm$, and Enterococcus faecalis, while slightly enhanced the growth of Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Blautia producta.	0
Among the @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ isolates from dog lung samples belonging to phylogroup B1, nine deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, but no correlation with the frequency of virulence factors could be established. Bacterial coinfections and secondary infections caused by @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ are commonly associated with multiple pathogens, as well as primary infections. Viral and bacterial coinfections have been commonly identified in humans. An earlier study showed that the mortality rate increased as a result of severe lung lesions caused by coinfection by influenza and @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ in a mouse model when compared to infections caused by a single pathogen. The nature of @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ isolates in the present study (primary or secondary infections) was not established. Nevertheless, it can be hypothesized that @gm$ E. coli @/gm$ strains belonging to phylogroup B1 with a low frequency of occurrence of virulence factors may enhance @di$ pneumonia @/di$ symptoms due to coinfection with other pathogens.	1
Amongst patients with H1N1 influenza admitted to ICUs in New Zealand and Australia, 49% had @di$ viral pneumonitis @/di$ or ARDS and 20% had secondary bacterial pneumonia. The most common bacterial pathogens reported included @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ pneumonia, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, @gm$ S. mitis @/gm$ and Haemophilus influenzae.	1
An approximate beta-Poisson dose-response model was used to estimate the probability of @di$ infection @/di$ (Pi) with pathogenic E. coli. Mean E. coli concentration ranged from 2.60E+ 02/100 mL to 4.84E+ 06/100 mL; enterococci ranged from 2.60E+ 02/100 mL to 3.19E+ 06/100 mL across all sampled sites. Of the 580 E. coli isolates obtained from this study, 89.1% were intestinal, and 7.6% were extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. The 579 enterococci obtained were 50.4% @gm$ E. faecalis @/gm$ (50.4%), 31.4% E. faecium, 3.5%, E. casseliflavus and 0.7% E. gallinarum. The community health risk stemming from the use of the water for recreational and domestic purposes revealed a greater health risk (Pi) from the ingestion of 1 mL of river water from upstream (range, 55.1-92.9%) than downstream (range, 26.8-65.3%) sites. The occupational risk of @di$ infection @/di$ with pathogenic E. coli for workers resulting from a once-off unintentional consumption of 1 mL of water was 0% (effluent) and 23.8% (raw influent). Multiple weekly exposures of 1 mL over a year could result in a Pi of 1.2 and 100% for the effluent and influent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that there is a potentially high risk of @di$ infection @/di$ for WWTP workers and communities that use river water upstream and downstream of the investigated WWTP.	1
An interesting clinical study concerning the impact of @di$ depression @/di$ on the microbiota was showed by Jiang et al.. They analyzed stool samples from 46 @di$ depressed @/di$ patients and 30 healthy controls. Pyrosequencing showed an increase in Actinobacteria and Alistipes in people with @di$ depression @/di$. In turn, Rong et al. studied differences in the gut microbiota of patients with @di$ depression @/di$ and patients with a @di$ depressive episode @/di$ in bipolar disorder. The microbial community in patients with @di$ depression @/di$ was characterized by an increased abundance of Prevotellaceae, including Prevotelladenticola F0289, Prevotella intermedia 17, @gm$ Prevotella ruminicola @/gm$ and Prevotella intermedia. Interesting results from in vivo studies presented Zhang et al., using CUMS-induced @di$ depression @/di$ mouse model. The results from the evaluation of the gut microbiota in Control CUMS mice indicated the following dominant species at the genus level: Odoribacter, Mucispirillum, Dehalobacterium, Oscillospira, Ruminococcus, Bilophila, Desulfovibrio and Helicobacter.In our study, the most characteristic biomarker was Muribaculum, which naturally occur in C57BL/6J mice and participates in the polysaccharides decomposition and thus in maintaining normal conditions in the intestines of mice. Additionally, the TPB CUMS group was distinguished by the most numerous type of Prevotellaceae UCG-001. Interestingly, our previous study by Szewczyk et al. on healthy C57BL/6J mice also showed an increase in this type of bacteria in the INU group after 10 weeks of supplementation. @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ produces succinates that participate in the degradation of inulin and TPB is 80% composed of inulin, which may explain an increased abundance of this bacteria.	1
Another study further showed that directly measuring functional activity reveals important insight into gut microbial community dynamics, including @di$ IBD @/di$-specific transcriptional activity that was either more pronounced or only detectable on the RNA level. The authors observed that the distribution of microbial species encoding a pathway can remain fairly constant in a patient over time while pathway transcription can change. For example, in the context of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, increases in disease severity for a patient co-occurred with @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ domination of pathway transcription while no DNA-level changes were observed.	1
As mentioned previously, @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ is a species of aquatic bacteria. It is a curved, gram-negative rod, found in seawater. It can cause gastrointestinal illness in those who ingest contaminated seafood. This organism is also associated with @di$ wound infections @/di$ and septicemia. One study found that the majority of @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$ cases in Florida occurred from April through October and were more likely to cause gastrointestinal disease. As with all cases of Vibrio infections, those with predisposing risk factors, such as liver disease, will have a more severe disease course with @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$, including sepsis and multi-organ failure. There is no standard treatment regimen for @gm$ V. parahaemolyticus @/gm$.	1
As the most important inhibiting neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA plays a role in regulation of apoptosis, intracellular autophagy and @di$ inflammation @/di$. In ETEC-infected IPEC-J2, GABA at 20 mg/kg activated GABAA receptor signaling and the AMPK-autophagy pathway to attenuate ETEC-induced apoptosis. In growing-finishing piglets, supplementation with GABA at 20 mg/kg was found to promote feed conversion and decrease TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling by acting on GABA receptors. GABA can be produced from @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidobacterium.	2
aureus isolated from bovine @di$ udder infection @/di$ and one of each of S. intermedius (M2), S. hyicus (M5), @gm$ S. xylosus @/gm$ (M6) and S.	0
Butyrate is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the gut and is also important in the regulation of many processes such as epigenetic mechanisms, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and @di$ inflammatory @/di$ conditions. Among various epigenetic modifications, butyrate is specifically known as a class I and class II HDAC inhibitor. An interesting study focused on 79 distinct commensal human gut bacteria to investigate the connection between SCFA profiles and HDAC inhibitory properties. These findings revealed that three butyrate-producing bacterial strains: @gm$ Megasphaera massiliensis @/gm$ MRx0029, Roseburia intestinalis MRx0071, and Bariatricus massiliensis MRx1342, manifested the highest inhibition of HDAC activity.	2
Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum and @gm$ Megasphaera elsdenii @/gm$ inhabit the human intestine and have probiotic potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of B. pullicaecorum and @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ on the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. They significantly (P < 0.05) extended the lifespan of C. elegans compared with Escherichia coli OP50, a standard food for the worm. Analysis of age-related biomarkers such as lipofuscin, body size, and locomotory activity showed that they retarded aging. They all failed to extend the lifespan of daf-12 or dbl-1 loss-of-function C. elegans mutants compared with E. coli OP50-fed worms. However, the increase in lifespan was observed in daf-16, jnk-1, pmk-1, and skn-1 mutants. Moreover, they increased the resistance of C. elegans to a human pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium. In conclusion, B. pullicaecorum and @gm$ M. elsdenii @/gm$ extend the lifespan of C. elegans via the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway associated with anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ processes in the innate immune system.	2
Case control studies have reported consistent altered microbial signatures at phylum level such as increased Proteobacteria, at family level such as increased Enterobacteriaceae and genera such as an increase in the abundance of Collinsella sp, Escherichia, Dorea and a decrease in the abundance of @gm$ Coprococcus @/gm$, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium and Prevotella. Similar microbial signatures were found in NASH as outlined in this recent review. Although these initial results suggest a measurable contrast in microbial signatures between individuals with hepatic steatosis and controls, there are, however, large discrepancies found across studies with varying results in the literature. However, a common microbial signature that has been associated with other @di$ metabolic diseases @/di$ is the reduction of levels of the butyrate producer F.	0
coli in the initial gut microbiota was associated with an increase in BMI at 1 year (8/10 with a @di$ weight gain @/di$ versus 3/11 without @di$ weight gain @/di$, P=0.03). A logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and surgery identified an association between the absence of E. coli and @di$ weight gain @/di$ at 1 year (odds ratio=10.7; 95% confidence interval 1.39-82.0); P=0.02). This was confirmed using %deltaBMI (mean+-standard Error, 4.0+-2.1 for patients without E. coli versus -3.4+-2.0 for patients with E. coli, P=0.01, Figure 3). This was also true when one outlier (a patient with a BMI increase of 19%) was excluded (n=20, 2.5+-1.6 versus -3.4+-2.0, P=0.03). We did not find any other significant differences regarding other bacteria (L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, B. animalis, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, @gm$ M. smithii @/gm$ and the Lactobacillus genus) or data from the amoxicillin-treated patients.	0
Considering the significant effect of the gut microbiota on NAFLD, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been tested in patients with metabolic syndrome and @di$ obesity @/di$. Although the improvement of insulin sensitivity is reported, mild alteration of other metabolic parameters is observed. However, specific probiotic treatments show satisfactory clinical efficacy. The mixture of eight probiotic strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacteria [@gm$ B. breve @/gm$, B. infantis, B. longum], Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) decreases the BMI of @di$ obese @/di$ children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and increases the level of GLP-1. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG treatment reveals a significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase in children with obesity-related liver disease. Another research study using similar bacteria including Streptococcus thermophilus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium breve @/gm$, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacilluscasei combined with lifestyle modification reports the amelioration of liver inflammation in patients with NAFLD.	2
Consistent with previous reports, maternal CKD-induced offspring @di$ hypertension @/di$ coincides with a high abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Dorea, and Erysipelatoclostridium, and a low abundance of Enterococcus. Conversely, maternal STS treatment enriched several genera that are reported as negatively associated with BP, including Streptococcus, Anaerotruncus, and Alistipes. Importantly, maternal STS treatment increased the abundance of several beneficial microbes with potential probiotic properties, including Akkermansia muciniphia, Blautia schinkii, and @gm$ Ruminococcus champanellensis @/gm$. Of note is that several studies have highlighted the positive role of Akkermansia muciniphila in improving @di$ hypertension @/di$. To further understand the impact of STS on programmed @di$ hypertension @/di$, further research should be investigated to truly explore its actions on beneficial microbes and their interactions with BP regulation.	0
"Consistent with recent discoveries about cholera pathogenesis, we incorporate how @gm$ V. cholera @/gm$ has a brief period of hyper-infectiousness upon excretion into the environment. After this hyper-infectious period, the bacteria return to a ""low infectious"" state, whereby a larger dose is required to cause @di$ infection @/di$."	1
Derived from @gm$ Clostridium botulinum @/gm$, this toxin causes paralysis of muscles and is thought to block the @di$ pain @/di$ sensation associated with migraines. Botulinum toxin is injected by a physician into the pericranial muscles in patients every three months. Botox is thought to cause its effects due to inhibiting neurotransmitter release from primary sensory neurons. This allows the toxin to suppress the @di$ pain @/di$, which may be due to excessive muscle contractions, which lead to migraines.	2
For 35 of those, samples were available for further analysis by additional diagnostic methods such as culture, sequencing, PCR, @di$ FTD @/di$-PCR or serology; some cases therefore had results from multiple diagnostic tests. A total of 30 cases were classified as L. longbeachae; six by culture, four by 16S-sequencing, two by paired serology, 12 by @di$ FTD @/di$-PCR and six by serology with a single high titre. In total, two cases were classified as @gm$ L. bozemanii @/gm$; one by culture and one by serology with a single high titre.	0
For example, the genera Bifidobacterium, Allobaculum and @gm$ Akkermansia @/gm$ were higher in lean compared to both @di$ obese @/di$ and WW group (Fig. 2). Also, the family Ruminococcacea was more similar between @di$ obese @/di$ (median: 6.9%) and WW-supplemented mice (5.6%) compared to lean (2.7%). Despite these differences, overall the fecal microbial composition of @di$ obese @/di$-control and WW mice was more similar to each other compared to lean although WW-supplementation yielded a unique pattern of bacterial abundances that did not necessarily cluster together with all @di$ obese @/di$ samples (Fig.	2
For instance, @di$ parasite-borne diseases @/di$, in addition to bacterial infections, are prevalent in dairy animals. The beneficial effects of probiotics on the recovery from @di$ parasite infections @/di$, such as helminths (e.g., Trichuris, Ascaris), Eimeria and Cryptosporidium, have been proven in several studies using various animal models. Furthermore, numerous farm-level case studies in poultry sector have shown that the use of probiotics (including Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$, and Bacillus species) improved the host resistance to Eimeria-borne coccidiosis. Similarly, researchers have reviewed the possible approach of manipulation of ruminant gut microbiome to control the @di$ parasite infection @/di$ in dairy animals. have attepted to identify the compositional change in intestinal microflora of Fasciola hepatica infected Holstein cows. The study revealed reduced diversity in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms and a specific decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and fungi Ascomycota in Fasciola infected cows. Earlier studies on probiotic-mediated gut microbiome manipulation suggest that probiotics could be used as an alternative strategy to ameliorate the helminth infections in dairy animals. However, more clinical research focusing on the probiotic mechanism in the presence of @di$ parasite infection @/di$ is needed to determine their efficacy in this area.	2
Four hundred and thirty patients with a blood culture positive for @gm$ S. aureus @/gm$ were recruited consecutively from five university hospitals and seven tertiary care hospitals in Finland between 1999 and 2002.. The median time between blood culture sampling and study inclusion was 3 days. The trial primarily aimed to examine the potential of two fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) to reduce the high mortality and complications associated with @di$ SAB @/di$ when added to the standard treatment and then patients were randomly assigned to receive standard antibiotic therapy or that together with a fluoroquinolone.	0
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that various species of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Bifidibacterium are able to prevent the progression of the @di$ experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis @/di$ (@di$ EAE @/di$) animal model of MS and improve clinical symptoms. Indeed, clinical trials indicate that Streptococcus spp., @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ spp., and Bifidobacterium spp.	2
How these perturbations exacerbate @di$ inflammation @/di$ has not been explored. Here, using antibiotic treatment and fecal microbial transfers, we showed that sepsis susceptibility is driven by pregnancy-induced changes to gut microbiome in mice and humans. Integrative multiomics and genetically engineered bacteria revealed that reduced @gm$ Parabacteroides merdae @/gm$ (@gm$ P. merdae @/gm$) abundance during pregnancy led to decreased formononetin (FMN) and increased macrophage death. Mechanistically, FMN inhibited macrophage pyroptosis by suppressing nuclear accumulation of hnRNPUL2 and subsequent binding to the Nlrp3 promoter. Treatment with FMN or deletion of murine hnRNPUL2 protected against septic @di$ inflammation @/di$. Intestinal abundances of @gm$ P. merdae @/gm$ and FMN inversely correlated with the progression of septic patients.	2
However, DSS treatment resulted in obvious histological alterations, including increased @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cell infiltration, loss of crypts, decrease in goblet cells, and thickening of the muscular mucosae. However, these pathological changes were attenuated by Bp7 and Bp8 intervention. Based on these results, @gm$ B. pseudolongum @/gm$ (Bp7 and Bp8) attenuated DSS-induced histopathological changes in the colon.	2
However, several bacteria relevant to human health with CR, including Pseudomonas fulva, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Enterococcus durans, @gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, A. johnsonii, Microbacterium lacus, and S. maltophilia, have been found in coastal seawater in Australia. These species have been found to cause human infections, such as bacteraemia (@gm$ Acinetobacter junii @/gm$, A. johnsonii, Pseudomonas fulva, and Brevundimonas vesicularis), meningitis (P. fulva), endocarditis (E. durans), cellulitis, soft tissue, urinary and respiratory tract infections (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Microbacterium lacus), and @di$ eye infections @/di$ (S. maltophilia and @gm$ A. junii @/gm$).	1
In @di$ CKD @/di$ patients, Bifidobacterium from the phyla Actinobacteria was depleted and supplementing Bifidobacterium in @di$ CKD @/di$ specific diets reduced serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and p-cresyl sulfate, demonstrating its role in reducing the accumulation of these uremic toxins. Patients with advanced stages of @di$ CKD @/di$ had increased numbers of Eggerthella lenta from the phyla Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum from the phyla Fusobacteriota, and @gm$ Alistipes shahii @/gm$ from the phyla Bacteroidetes.	1
In a previous study, @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ pneumonia was observed in twenty patients over a ninety-one-month period. Half of these cases had hospital-acquired pneumonia and three had ventilator associated pneumonia. The patients diagnosed with @gm$ Raoultella ornithinolytica @/gm$ presented a medical history of solid cancer, immunodeficiency, @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$ or chronic alcoholics.	1
In a study conducted on newly purchased Tellicherry goats from Kerala, 34.5% animals were infected by @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ and affected animals showed clinical signs including inappetence, weakness, coughing, nasal and ocular discharges, diarrhoea, pyrexia, abortion, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Severe cases of caprine babesiosis were associated with jaundice, diarrhoea, haemoglobinuria, microcytic hypochromic anaemia, hypoproteinemia and increased Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), AST activity, ALT activity, BUN and Icterus Index. Babesiosis due to @di$ B. ovis infection @/di$ is usually associated with a mild chronic form of disease, accompanied by jaundice and haemoglobinuria. Experimental infection of sheep by transfusing @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ infected blood resulted in development of mild to moderate haemolytic anaemia and jaundice. In the present case, the elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels (pre-hepatic jaundice), hemoglobinuria, and signs of systemic inflammatory responses suggest acute febrile haemolytic form of @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$ infection.	1
In addition to SCFAs, omega-3 fatty acids and metabolites derived from tryptophan (Trp) have been implicated as drivers or modulators of diet-microbiome-host interactions in @di$ EAE @/di$/MS. Whether they derive from food or from bacteria, it seems that the effects of these metabolites are exerted through shared mechanisms: G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, epigenetic regulation of gene expression through inhibition of histone deacetylases, or the effects of transcription factors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (reviewed by). Milk proteins are generally a source of Trp-containing peptides. Trp, an essential amino acid primarily used in protein synthesis, has numerous physiological functions, as it is a precursor of bioactive molecules produced by gut bacteria that are fundamental to human health. Rothhammer et al. reported that Trp metabolites, such as kynurenine, are able to downregulate CNS immune responses through activation of the AHR on glial cells. Dietary Trp is metabolized by members of the gut microbiota (e.g., Lactobacillaceae and @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species) into AHR ligands, such as indole-3-aldehyde and indole-3-lactic acid, which have an effect on astrocytes, reducing CNS inflammation and disease scores in @di$ EAE @/di$. Given that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ species were the predominant taxa in the marmoset fecal microbiota, there is the potential that @gm$ Bifidobacterium @/gm$ mediated health benefits in the YBS-fed marmosets via Trp-derived metabolites.	2
In addition, a study revealed an existing relationship between microbial agents and gastric cancer: chronic @di$ infection @/di$ with gram-negative bacteria Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus mitis, @gm$ S. parasanguinis @/gm$, Lactobacillus, Veillonella, and Prevotella dominates flora in the microbiota of people who develop gastric cancer. The results of faecal sample testing from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and healthy individuals have shown that Enterococcus and @gm$ Streptococcus @/gm$ are increasingly present in samples from CRC patients, while the butyrate-producing bacteria Roseburia and Clostridium predominate in the control samples.	1
In atypical @di$ infection @/di$, @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ enters the body upon the ingestion of contaminated food, passes through the stomach to the small intestine and becomes systemic in one of two ways; either by invading M cells to reach the lymphatic system or via carriage within CD18* monocytes directly to the bloodstream. Remarkably, @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ can become systemic within minutes of @di$ oral infection @/di$ in man or mice by hijacking phagocytic cells. This rapid dissemination is mediated by the specific secretion of @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ proteins that bind to parts of the host cell motility apparatus. Once @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ reaches its preferred site of replication, the spleen and liver, it initially replicates within neutrophils and eventually macrophages/monocytes, and can be found in virtually every white blood cell. Furthermore, the host is made more hospitable to the invading @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ through diverse virulence factors, which are encoded within horizontally transferred DNA sequences (pathogenicity islands), then expressed and secreted in a highly regulated process at different stages of host @di$ infection @/di$ (Figure 1).	1
In conclusion, this study showed that an elevated consumption of RM and WG products, respectively, modifies intestinal microbiota and is associated with a simultaneous change in measures of @di$ obesity @/di$. The increase of the appearance of @gm$ C. aerofaciens @/gm$ through a fibre rich diet supports the assumption of health promoting effects of WG products.	2
In contrast to this barrier function, we recently showed that MUC1 can also act as a receptor for @gm$ Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis @/gm$ (@gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$). Infection assays of confluent HT29-MTX cells with @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ showed that the @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ giant adhesin SiiE conferred interaction with MUC1, enabling efficient apical invasion into intestinal epithelial cells. The interaction of @gm$ S. Enteritidis @/gm$ SiiE with MUC1 was dependent on sialic acids. Others demonstrated that enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) colocalized with transiently transfected MUC1 on the surface of HEK293 cells, and this interaction is mediated by binding of its aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF) to the sialic acids present on MUC1. The binding of AAF with MUC1 also facilitated migration of neutrophils across the epithelium, promoting an @di$ inflammatory @/di$ response to EAEC infection.	1
In our research, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, Ruminiclostridium, and @gm$ Bilophila @/gm$ were enriched, while Muribaculaceae and Alloprevotella were suppressed in the HFD group in comparison to the mice on the normal control diet. However, the tartary buckwheat partially reversed the differential abundance changes in these strains caused by HFD feeding. It is worth noting that a positive dose-dependent manner in the intervention effect of the tartary buckwheat on the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Alistipes, Ruminiclostridium, Alloprevotella, and Oscillibacter was also observed. Theoretically, the gut microbiome is a critical component of the intestinal immune barrier and is highly associated with maintaining intestinal balance. Intestinal microbiome dysbiosis may disrupt the gut epithelial barrier and increase intestinal permeability. This leaky gut may permit the translocation of bacteria and their metabolites into the systemic circulation, leading to systemic microinflammation and metabolic endotoxemia. Our findings align with previous observations that HFD increased circulating LPS levels and inflammatory cytokine release. We also verified the positive correlation between lipid metabolism parameters and the abundances of @gm$ Bilophila @/gm$, Ruminiclostridium, and Oscillibacter, which can exacerbate HFD-induced @di$ metabolic dysfunction @/di$ and promote the development of intestinal inflammation as a common LPS-producing bacteria. Conversely, Muribaculaceae, known to reduce serum LPS levels and maintain intestinal epithelial health, was negatively correlated with metabolic indicators based on our results. We noticed that the HB intervention evidently reduced the relative abundance of @gm$ Bilophila @/gm$ and prevented HFD-induced lipid metabolism disturbances, which is consistent with previous findings.	1
In patients with @di$ IBD @/di$ gut SCFAs are reduced, although the results of the relevant studies could be characterized as conflicting. In a recently published systematic review and metaanalysis, Zhuang et al. found significant alterations of SCFAs in @di$ IBD @/di$ patients; e.g., in patients with active and inactive ulcerative colitis inverse SCFA alterations. The significance of these fatty acids in the pathogenesis of @di$ IBD @/di$ is further supported by the fact according to which bacteria in mucosa and feces of patients with @di$ IBD @/di$ producing SCFAs are reduced. @di$ IBD @/di$ patients show reduced levels of dominant SCFAs-producing bacteria (like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and @gm$ Roseburia intestinalis @/gm$) in intestinal mucosa and feces, and lower levels of SCFAs compared to healthy controls.	2
In summary, in this study we found that both oral and enteric @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains upregulated expression of TLR4 and MD-2 in HT-29 cells. Some @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains, most of them from patients with @di$ IBD @/di$, were more effective in regulating surface expression of TLR4 and MD-2, as well as Gly-TLR4. @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ infection in HT-29 cells did not affect the expression of TLR2 and TLR5. All @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains induced production of IL-8 and COX-2 in HT-29 cells. These data suggest that a potential role of specific @gm$ C. concisus @/gm$ strains in modulating the intestinal epithelial responses to bacterial LPS needs to be investigated.	1
In the groups receiving probiotics, a beneficial association was observed between phylum Actinobacteria, family Coriobacteriaceae, and genus @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ and different parameters of body composition. Thus, it can be said that probiotic therapy supports the beneficial effects of these bacteria on body weight. Actinobacteria are involved in metabolic health, and the abundance of this family is associated with the consumption of dietary fibre and the production of SCFAs. Therefore, it may have anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ properties and improve the intestinal barrier integrity. Actinobacteria were more abundant in Western and high sugar diets and were found in higher concentrations in obese individuals. An increased abundance of Actinobacteria was also associated with type 2 diabetes in urban Africa. In contrast, another study showed that Actinobacteria levels decreased in obese individuals. The family Coriobacteriaceae plays important metabolic roles such as the conversion of bile acid, steroids, and phytoestrogens, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism, and is associated with good metabolic health in overweight and obese populations. This family has been investigated in metabolic diseases, although our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. @gm$ Blautia @/gm$ is involved in the production of butyric and acetic acids which decreases obesity by regulating G-protein coupled receptors (GPR) 41 and 43.	2
In363 was initially characterized in the SGI2 resistance island from @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ enteric serovar Emerk, and is organized as follows: IRi, 5'-CS, GCA (dfrA1 (@di$ dihydrofolate @/di$ resistance)-gcuC (unknown function)), Delta3'-CS (qacED1-Deltasul1), the In0 (an empty class 1 integron)-ISCR3-tetA(G) (class G tetracycline resistance)-cmlA9 (chloramphenicol resistance) region, and IRi-IS6100-IRt-Deltatni (DeltatniB-tniA)-IRt.	0
Lipid-A, the lipid moiety of LPS, is a powerful antigen that elicits a florid pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ host response. Lipid-A synthesis is known to be upregulated in the presence of hemin. Genes responsible for Lipid-A synthesis were preferentially enriched in disease when compared to health, with Capnocytophaga, Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, @gm$ Porphyromonas @/gm$, Prevotella, Tannerella, and Treponema, as major contributors. The combined enrichment of both iron acquisition genes and Lipid A in disease suggests that this microbiome has the potential for a virulent transcriptional profile in the presence of blood (i.e. in conditions of @di$ inflammation @/di$, such as gingivitis).	1
Meanwhile, CCP also exhibited a stimulatory trend on the growth of @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ (Figure 1(b)) but no significant difference was observed (Padj > 0.05). @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ was first reported by Rogosa to be using amino acid as the sole energy source for growth. The effects of @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ on human health were unclear. Previously, Qi et al. found that the composition of Haemophilus, Lachnospira, Dialister, and @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ was decreased significantly in T1DM Chinese children compared to controls. Li et al. found that the relative abundances of @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$, Succinivibrio, and Citrobacter were reduced obviously in canines with high fat diet-induced obesity, while green tea polyphenols could increase the abundances of @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$, Succinivibrio, and Citrobacter. These studies indicated in some ways that @gm$ Acidaminococcus @/gm$ could be associated negatively with metabolic diseases such as obesity and @di$ diabetes mellitus @/di$.	2
merdae, were found to be consistent biomarkers of @di$ RMI @/di$ in additional data sets. One species, namely, @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$, was found to be a biomarker of @di$ UMI @/di$. After further verification, P. merdae and @gm$ A. equolifaciens @/gm$ were removed from this list, as their differential values at least in one of the additional data sets were <0.1, and they did not exhibit differences between the R and NR groups in the log-ratio analysis. Thus, from the list of early identified cross-study taxonomic biomarkers, only B. adolescentis, F. prausnitzii, and E. rectale were reproducible in the Spencer 2021 and Lee 2022 data sets. It is noteworthy that only F. prausnitzii was found to be a predictor of @di$ RMI @/di$ in all seven of the data sets that were included in the analysis and that E. rectale and B. adolescentis were consistent in four of the data sets. Next, we carried out a log-ratio assessment of B. adolescentis, F. prausnitzii, and E. rectale across metagenomes in additional data sets. Since representative biomarkers of @di$ UMI @/di$ were not identified, only taxa with differential values of <-0.5 were selected as a set of denominators.	1
Moreover, a low abundance of Turicibacter has been characterized in the patients with @di$ autism spectrum disorder @/di$ (@di$ ASD @/di$), associated with the 5-HT metabolic disorder. Daily intake of @gm$ Lactobacillus helveticus @/gm$ CCFM1076 restores the balance of the 5-HTergic system in both the gastrointestinal tract and brain, thereby ameliorating @di$ ASD @/di$-like behaviors.	2
Mushroom polysaccharides could improve @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ and promote gastrointestinal health by promoting the abundance of healthy bacteria and suppressing the abundance of harmful bacteria. Table 2 summarizes the regulatory effects of typical mushroom polysaccharides on gut microbiota composition in chronic diseases, including T2DM. Akkermansia muciniphila accounts for 0.5-5% of the human intestinal tract, but it accounts for a lower proportion in obese and diabetic patients. This decrease results in damage to the intestinal barrier function and causes intestinal inflammation. G. frondosa polysaccharides could reverse the level of Akkermansia in T2DM mice to inhibit the development of inflammation. Moreover, Armillariella tabescens polysaccharides up-regulated the levels of @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$ and Ackermanella to reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content and improve intestinal barrier function, thereby reducing systemic inflammation in T2DM mice. G. lucidum F31 increased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio to improve glucose metabolism disorder and enriched SCFAs-producing bacteria including @gm$ Lactobacillus @/gm$, Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae to improve the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Thus, G. lucidum F31 could alleviate @di$ insulin resistance @/di$ and inflammation by reducing the release of LPS from the gut into circulation.	2
None of the lactobacilli or @di$ BV @/di$-associated bacteria in the present study produce leucine when cultured in BHI, although it is avidly consumed by Pe. anaerobius (Fig. 1A and 3A and Fig. S2G and S3G). Tyrosine is produced in modest amounts by six of the lactobacilli isolates, most notably by L. acidophilus, L. gasseri 1 and 2, and most @gm$ G. vaginalis @/gm$ strains as well as A. vaginae, Pr. bivia, and M. curtisii (Fig. 1A and 3A and Fig. S2C). It is consumed avidly by Pe. anaerobius (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2C). With the exception of Pe. anaerobius, L. crispatus 1, and L. iners, where there is modest consumption, the concentration of betaine does not change in the spent culture of either the lactobacilli or the @di$ BV @/di$-associated bacteria (Fig.	0
Observed clinical signs including hemorrhage and petechia in the head, around the mouth, operculum, anal and fins base, along with opened and severe wounds on the abdomen and dorsal areas of the body were expected to be seen in the @di$ infections @/di$ caused by bacteria especially motile aeromonads. Based on our biochemical and molecular tests, the isolated bacteria from both studied sturgeons was Aeromonas veronii. A. veronii (strain X106909) was identified as a pathogen and cause of Siberian sturgeon's (Acipenser baerii) mortality for the first time in China. Likewise, @gm$ A. hydrophila @/gm$ as a pathogenic agent has been isolated from Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) in China.	1
Our functional studies in both Abx-treated and GF mouse models demonstrated that colonization of Bifidobacterium spp., particularly @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$, reduced the serum amylase concentration and ameliorated pancreatic tissue damages in caerulein-induced MAP and @di$ SAP @/di$ models, and improved survival rates in a retrograde injection @di$ SAP @/di$ model (Figure 2). Although subspecies of @gm$ B. animalis @/gm$ have been intensively studied and recently shown to have beneficial effects for obesity, metabolic health and microbiota dysbiosis, our study is the first to reveal its crucial role in regulation of the pathogenesis of AP.	2
Periapical lesions are @di$ necrosis of @/di$ the dental pulp tissue associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response due to infections, also known as periapical granuloma. Periapical granuloma is characterized by the persistence of microorganisms in the radicular system of the dental pulp, most of them bacteria like @gm$ Acinetobacter johnsonii @/gm$ and Propionibacterium acnes, or fungi such as Candida albicans. Infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes and plasmatic cells is followed by the production of a neutrophil-rich exudate, resulting in an acute oral inflammation. Chronic inflammation is established after the organism attempts to repair the damaged tissue by production of new odontoblasts, mesenchymal cells and matrix proteins, but being compromised by the presence of the microorganisms, forming a granuloma tissue. As a consequence of periapical granuloma, radicular cysts appear, spaces filled with extracellular liquid derived from epithelial fragments of the periodontal ligament after @di$ necrosis of @/di$ the dental pulp.	1
Prevalence of @di$ periodontal pathogens @/di$ in plaque samples of patients is listed in Table 4. After sequencing the amplified products of PCR using primers for Treponema sp., these primers were found to be inappropriate for the detection of T. denticola, since all the samples with amplified products were identified as @gm$ Treponema vincentii @/gm$ with 100% homology.	0
Previous studies have evaluated the gut microbiota composition of @di$ thyroid cancer @/di$ patients and found a dominance of the genera Prevotella, Roseburia, Coprococcus, Anaerostipes, @gm$ Ruminococcus @/gm$, Neisseria, Streptococcus, and Prophyromonas.	1
PURPOSE: To report a case of endophthalmitis caused by @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$. METHODS: A 33-year-old man sustained a penetrating injury of the right eye that resulted in several ocular surgical procedures including pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, scleral-sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens, and penetrating keratoplasty. More than 4 years after the penetrating injury he presented for examination with pain, @di$ photophobia @/di$, redness, decreased vision, and floaters in the right eye. Vitreous culture grew @gm$ Clostridium sordellii @/gm$. RESULTS: Following intravitreal injection of antibiotics, the patient's vision improved from 3/200 to 20/80 (baseline visual acuity) within 2 days. All signs of inflammation resolved without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium sordellii endophthalmitis may have a more benign course than the fulminant endophthalmitis typically seen with other @gm$ Clostridium @/gm$ species.	1
STZ-induced @di$ diabetic @/di$ Wistar rats in high-fat diet (T2DM) were supplemented with fermented milk that was produced by inoculation of skim milk with probiotic cultures, L. rhamnosus NCDC 17 and L. rhamnosus GG, at 1% (v/v). Both probiotic treatments increased the population of total bacteria. L. rhamnosus NCDC 17 supplementation group had higher populations of E. rectale- @gm$ C. coccoides @/gm$, Bacteroides, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.	0
Taxonomically, the relative abundance of @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ and Burkholderiales at baseline was predictive of week 14 remission. @gm$ R. inulinivorans @/gm$ is a relatively low abundance gram-positive organism, certain strains of which encode genes for pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ flagellin proteins that stimulate interleukin-8 production. @gm$ R inulinivorans @/gm$ also produces butyrate and propionate both of which have anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ effects through a variety of mechanisms including reinforcing the integrity of the colonic epithelial barrier, reducing oxidative stress, and decreasing @di$ inflammation @/di$ through inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF- kappaB) activation by histone deacetylation. Butyrate also inhibits @di$ inflammation @/di$ through inhibition of the IFNgamma/STAT1 signaling pathways associated with @di$ chronic inflammation @/di$ and enhances apoptosis of colonic T-cells.	2
The @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ spp. are gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that cause brucellosis, which afflicts over 500,000 people annually and severely damages animal production. At present, the genus @gm$ Brucella @/gm$ contains 10 species, among which four species (Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Brucella abortus, and @gm$ Brucella canis @/gm$) are thought to be pathogenic to humans. Moreover, B. melitensis, B. suis, and B. abortus are also the main causes of human brucellosis due to their highly contagious characteristics and are listed as potential bioweapons by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These organisms cause abortion, infertility, and low milk production in their natural hosts (bovines, goats, and sheep), whereas the common manifestations of human infection include undulant fever, arthralgia, asthenia, @di$ depression @/di$, and lymphadenopathy; therefore, these organisms pose a substantial threat to livestock production, food safety, and human health.	1
The data from human @di$ infections @/di$ and experiments in animals have shown that both systemic and mucosal arms of humoral immunity are activated during shigellosis. Shigellae are locally invasive pathogens and induction of mucosal immunity should be highly desirable but the correlates of protective immunity are controversial in the case of shigellosis. It is still a contentious issue whether mucosal IgA antibodies or serum IgG antibodies are protective against @gm$ Shigella @/gm$. Some studies have reported strong mucosal sIgA antibody response following natural @di$ infection @/di$/experimental challenge, whereas in some, serum anti-O-antigen IgG antibodies were reported protective.	1
The first individual bacterial species of these phylum associated with @di$ IBD @/di$ was found to be @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, a Firmicutes and member of the Clostridium Group IV. Patients with recurrent CD after resection were found at the time of resection exam to have decreased amounts of @gm$ Faecalibacterium prausnitzii @/gm$, a butyrate producer, suggesting that decreased @gm$ F. prausnitzii @/gm$ may contribute to or be a marker of a dysbiotic state that predisposes a person to @di$ IBD @/di$.	2
The genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, @gm$ Haemophilus @/gm$, Veillonella and Gemella strongly contributed to dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota of patients. Moreover, analysis of immunological biomarkers of the saliva of patients concluded that the observed dysbiosis was associated with elevated @di$ inflammatory @/di$ response of several cytokines with depleted lysozyme, some of which showed a powerful correlation with certain relatively abundant bacterial species.	1
The high prevalence of Aeromonas bacteremia could relate to that the patients with chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis are susceptible to invasive @di$ Aeromonas infections @/di$ if they eat of raw seafood or freshwater fish, and have the cutaneous exposure to fresh and brackish water or trauma. Wu et al. reported that @gm$ A. sobria @/gm$ (55%) and A. hydrophila (45%) were the causative species of Aeromonas spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Choi et al. compared the clinical manifestations of SBP, indicating that the incidence of @di$ Aeromonas infection @/di$ significant increased in warm weather months, as also associated with diarrheal episodes in the group.	1
The latest fatal outbreak of carbapenem-resistant @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$ at the US National Institute of Health Clinical Center underscores that infection control precautions were the only effective measure that eventually stopped the outbreak. This outbreak led to 18 affected patients and 6 deaths attributable to @di$ K. pneumonia @/di$. Whole-genome-sequencing performed after the end of the outbreak revealed that infections control practitioners failed to appreciate that the most important transmitters of MDROs were asymptomatic carriers and not sick cases (infection control measures were, in fact, not intensified for the carriers) and they failed to identify an environmental source (improperly disinfected respiratory equipment) of the MDR @gm$ K. pneumoniae @/gm$.	1
The local @di$ infections @/di$ caused by periodontal bacteria were associated with systemic inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Several plausible mechanisms have been proposed. Lipopolysaccharide, a constituent of the outer membrane of periodontopathogenic bacteria such as P. intermedia, T. forsythia, and @gm$ V. parvula @/gm$ has been indicated to stimulate the production of various proinflammatory mediators.	1
The pathogenic pathogen-associated molecular in the intestine influence TLRs to initiate activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in macrophages and subsequent @di$ inflammatory @/di$ responses. The TLR stimulation increase production of pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$, gram-negative bacteria, produces LPS, which stimulates TLR4 as the most sensitive TLR to pathogenic LPS. The TLR4 expression was reduced in the jejunum and liver of the bacteriophage-fed laying hens compared to the NC laying hens. This means that the signaling was highly dependent on @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ infection and the paracellular presence of S.	2
The presence of @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ in the feces of feedlot cattle coincide with that reported for cattle fed wet-distilled grain diets, with a key role on recalcitrant starch in the gut. Moreover, a beneficial in vitro interaction was observed between @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$ and R. gnavus, with the latter being able to benefit from starch degradation products released by @gm$ R. bromii @/gm$. Within Ruminococcaceae, the presence of F. praunitzii identified from probiotic-treated fecal samples was reported to correlate with health and weight gain in ruminants, exerting intestinal anti-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ effects In addition, a variable Lachnospiraceae to Christensenellaceae ratio was detected in all fecal samples, and their presence agrees with those found in the fecal and GIT microbiomes of ruminant and nonruminant herbivorous livestock, particularly high feed efficiency steers, dairy cattle and high-grain fed lambs.	2
The primary goal of this work was to determine if a defined bacteriotherapy (triple-@gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$, as well as the individual strains of @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$) could be as effective as a complex bacteriotherapy (FMT) in a murine @di$ IBD @/di$ model. We have shown that FMT, using stool from healthy donor mice, was effective at decreasing weight loss and increasing survival in DSS-induced murine colitis. This is in agreement with a recent study by Tian, et al., which demonstrated the beneficial effect of FMT on DSS colitis in BALB/c mice, leading to increased survival and reduced disease activity index scores, colonic inflammation by histology, and inflammatory cytokine levels. However, C57BL/6J mice in this study did not benefit from FMT. The investigators found that C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice responded differentially to the DSS, with C57BL/6J experiencing more significant weight loss and decreased survival compared to the BALB/c mice. This is likely a result of mice receiving 8 days of DSS followed by 8 days of FMT. Thus, by the time the C57BL/6J mice received FMT, the colitis was already too severe to benefit from this treatment. In our study, FMT and DSS were given simultaneously, preventing the severe DSS-colitis phenotype. Notably, in the Tian, et al. study, mice treated with FMT had a significant increase in @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ in their distal colon, which supports our finding that @gm$ Bacteroides @/gm$ species contribute to the reduction of intestinal inflammation.	2
The results of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that SCP-1 reshaped the gut microbiota composition, especially by promoting the proliferation of butyrate-producing genera, such as Intestinaimonas, @gm$ [Eubacterium] ventriosum @/gm$ group, Lachnospiraceae_UCG_010, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG_001, and suppressing the growth of @di$ inflammation @/di$-related bacteria (i.e., Escherichia/Shigella). Furthermore, SCP-1 significantly attenuated @di$ inflammation @/di$ by reducing the levels of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier function, inhibiting glial activation, and decreasing the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Collectively, our findings suggest that SCP-1 may prevent the development of AD via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of @di$ inflammation @/di$, for a potential application in preventing or managing AD.	2
The results of the current study showed that the total counts and diversity of intestinal flora were comparable between healthy rabbits and those with diarrhea, but the frequencies of certain bacteria varied significantly, such as Roseburia, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$, and Clostridium. Roseburia is a saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from the cecum, and includes the species Roseburia hominis. The fecal microbiota of patients with @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$ contains a lower abundance of R. hominis than that of controls. A significant decrease in R. hominis colonization was recently demonstrated in the guts of ulcerative colitis patients. It has been suggested that the immunomodulatory properties of Roseburia could be useful for the control and treatment of gut inflammation in rabbit production as well. According to published reports, the genus Clostridium contains several species with different functions. Some of these can produce exotoxins, including Clostridium difficile and Clostridium botulinum. However, Clostridium butyricum promotes growth performance and immune function and improves the balance of the intestinal microflora in broiler chickens. We found that a lower abundance of some subtypes of Clostridium caused diarrhea, but the specific subtype involved was not clear and further experimental studies are required to confirm this finding. In addition, @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ was found to differ between healthy rabbits and those with diarrhea. Previous studies have shown that a greater frequency of abdominal pain is correlated with an increased abundance of several bacterial taxa from the genus @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$. @gm$ Alistipes @/gm$ may be associated with abdominal pain in rabbits with diarrhea.	0
The results showed that the bacterial community in the host gut changed significantly at both the phylum and genus levels after @di$ infection @/di$ with B. bassiana. Among them, the abundance of Serratia increased dramatically after @di$ infection @/di$ and the abundance of Yersiniaceae, Enterobacterales and @gm$ Klebsiella @/gm$ also increased. These results suggest that the mechanism of rebuilding the host gut bacterial community after @di$ infection @/di$ by insect filamentous fungi is very complex, but our results do not reveal whether they determine the rebuilding of the bacterial communities.	1
The spread of carbapenemase-producing @di$ Enterobacteriaceae @/di$ (@di$ CPE @/di$) has become a prominent health-care challenge worldwide in the treatment of infectious diseases. Carbapenemases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), imipenemase (IMP), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), and oxacillinase (OXA)-48 medicated antibiotic resistance (Nordmann et al.,; Shi et al.,). IMP-type CPEs have been reported globally (Queenan and Bush,; Tzouvelekis et al.,) and have become the predominant form in Australia (Espedido et al.,; Leung et al.,; Sidjabat et al.,) since the first report of IMP-1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Japan (Watanabe et al.,). One of the most commonly observed IMP variants was IMP-4 in clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates (Leung et al.,; Hu et al.,), which was firstly detected in Hong Kong (Chu et al.,). Among more than 11 different species of IMP-4-producing @di$ CPE @/di$, @gm$ Enterobacter cloacae @/gm$ has emerged as the predominant species (Sidjabat et al.,; Cao et al.,). IMP-type @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ isolates have been found in Taiwan (IMP-8), China (IMP-1 and IMP-34), Thailand (IMP-14), Japan (IMP-1 and IMP-11), Spain (IMP-13), United Kingdom (IMP-1), and South Africa (Figure 1; Chen et al.,; Shet et al.,; Hayakawa et al.,; Wang et al.,; Osei Sekyere,; Matsumura et al.,). IMP-4-producing @gm$ E. cloacae @/gm$ was particularly reported in Australia and caused clinical outbreaks, which brought greater challenges to infection control (Leung et al.,; Chapuis et al.,; Pang et al.,).	1
The top 10 serovars in terms of number of hits are mostly @di$ invasive @/di$ serovars: S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A, and @gm$ S. Paratyphi C @/gm$ are notable typhoidal serovars adapted to humans; S. Dublin, S. Pullorum, and S. Choleraesuis are well-known host adapted serovars of cattle, poultry, and pigs, respectively. S. Napoli is an emerging serovar in Europe, phylogenetically closely related to S. Paratyphi A, carrying an almost identical pattern of typhoid-associated genes, and capable of causing a form of @di$ invasive @/di$ nontyphoidal disease. The @di$ invasive @/di$ behavior is not as clear-cut with the rest of the serovars, but there have been several reports of it: S. Bovismorbificans is capable of causing bloodstream infections, and has recently been described as an emerging disease in Malawi, converging toward a phenotype resembling a human adapted iNTS variant. Although not strictly an extraintestinal serovar, S. Virchow has been known to cause @di$ invasive @/di$ illness. S. Weltevreden is an emerging cause of diarrheal and sometimes @di$ invasive @/di$ disease in humans in tropical regions, and may be adapted to life in aquatic hosts. While large in total numbers in pubMLST, S. Enteritidis only makes up 2% of the positive hits. Because S. Enteritidis is one of the most commonly isolated iNTS strains, there exists a possible link to @di$ invasive @/di$ behavior.	1
The top five enriched species in the healthy control group were Bacteroides uniformis, @gm$ Anaerostipes hadrus @/gm$, Blautia wexlerae, Roseburia intestinalis, and Phascolarctobacterium faecium (Supplementary Fig. S2c). Finally, the top five enriched species in the @di$ HCC @/di$ group were Ruminococcus gnavus, Bifidobacterium longum, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus group, and Bacteroides finegoldii (Supplementary Fig.	0
"The type genus Brucella contains the causative agents of brucellosis, which remains one of the most important @di$ zoonotic diseases @/di$ globally, with more than 500,000 new cases reported each year. For several decades the genus Brucella was described as consisting of six ""classical"" species (B. abortus, B. melitensis, @gm$ B. ovis @/gm$, B."	1
This study found an increased abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ in children with TD. @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ is closely related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), @di$ inflammatory bowel disease @/di$ and other intestinal diseases. It contains enzymes that play an important role in the degradation of mucin, which may lead to an increase in intestinal permeability. @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ has also been confirmed to show a pro-inflammatory effect, and its increased expression level may lead to increased expression of inflammatory factors; the levels of inflammatory factors were also shown to be increased in children with TD. These inflammatory factors can pass through the blood-brain barrier to affect the development of the nervous system. Thus, an increased abundance of @gm$ Prevotella @/gm$ may cause changes in the levels of inflammatory factors, which may also be involved in the pathogenesis of TD.	1
Though the incidence of @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ bacteremia is low (0.97/100,000 in patients who are hospitalized and 0.7/100,000 in nonselected populations), @gm$ Clostridium perfringens @/gm$ liver abscess is even rarer. There are various risk factors for clostridium infection, including any condition with insufficient immune function, such as elderly age, poorly controlled diabetes, @di$ cirrhosis @/di$ and malignancy, especially gastrointestinal and genitourinary malignancies. Intra-abdominal is the major site of Clostridium perfringens infection. In the case reported here, the patient was suffering from pancreatic head cancer and jaundice caused by obstruction of the distal common bile duct. Pneumocholangiosis after ERCP is a common clinical phenomenon. Most of the gas is distributed along the bile duct, and the wall of the bile duct is smooth. However, the pneumoconiosis in this case manifested as extensive dilatation and rigidity of bile ducts at all levels and concomitant destruction of the liver. Therefore, we postulate that after common bile duct stenting, the @gm$ clostridium @/gm$ organisms migrated to the liver via the damaged Vater's ampulla and caused local infection in the liver parenchyma, which was later demonstrated by the bacterial culture.	1
Three cases (YNCD550, 822, and 831) had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with rotavirus, 13 cases had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with diarrheagenic E. coli, and one case (YNCD601) had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with non-typhoidal Salmonella (S1). According to the bacterial culture result, 6 strains (patients) were found co-infected with diarrheagenic E. coli, non-typhoidal Salmonella and rotavirus. Among them, one case (YNCD831) had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with rotavirus; four cases had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with diarrheagenic E. coli and one case (YNCD601) had co-@di$ infection @/di$ with non-typhoidal Salmonella (S1). The age of these 6 patients were no more than 2-year-old. Furthermore, two @gm$ C. difficile @/gm$ strains (YNCD399 and YNCD591) were non-toxigenic, others were toxigenic isolates.	0
To identify associations between prevalent PS and @di$ ICSTs @/di$, a network based on their relationships was produced (Fig. 4), highlighting that 66% of the highly prevalent PS (five most prevalent strains per species) were exclusive to either Healthy-ICST, Unhealthy-ICST, or Mixed-ICST. Bacteroides fragilis, Blautia wexlerae, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, and Klebsiella pneumoniae PSs showed the highest ICST specificity, with more than 80% being highly prevalent in a single ICST. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis PS showed the lowest ICST specificity (Fig. 4). Interestingly, 20 out of 175 analyzed PS were identified in members of each infant group, of which Escherichia coli PS (n = 3) was shown to be the most prevalent. In contrast, Bacteroides uniformis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, @gm$ Klebsiella michiganensis @/gm$, and Ruminococcus gnavus PS were shared between the three main @di$ ICSTs @/di$, with no ICST-specific correlations (Fig.	0
To the Editor: Alistipes finegoldii was previously isolated from appendiceal tissue samples in children with acute appendicitis and from perirectal and @di$ brain abscess @/di$ material. 16S rDNA sequencing studies showed that this bacterium clustered with @gm$ A. putredinis @/gm$ (Figure) in the Bacteroidetes group.	1
"Two genes upregulated after infection exhibited quite a different pattern of expression from the ""@di$ inflammatory @/di$"" ones and these included the transcripts coding for the constant parts of IgG and IgA. As we proposed previously, the level of transcription of IgG and IgA increases in the chicken cecum with age even in the non-infected chickens and infection of chickens with @gm$ Salmonella Enteritidis @/gm$ increased the expression of IgG and IgA further. Maximal IgG and IgA expression after the infection was recorded when the expression of the remaining @di$ inflammatory @/di$ genes began to decline."	1
We performed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) at each sampling time point to identify the biomarkers of @di$ PTB @/di$. At time point A, six microbiomes that contained @gm$ Ruminococcus bromii @/gm$ and Gemmiger formicilis were significantly associated with FTB (p < 0.05). Three microbiomes that contained U. parvum at time point B and three microbiomes that contained Staphylococcus epidermis were significantly associated with @di$ PTB @/di$ (p < 0.05). However, we did not identify any microbiome that was associated with @di$ PTB @/di$ at all three time points (Fig.	0
We report a rare case of CVC infection caused by @gm$ Leuconostoc citreum @/gm$, in a CVC-dependent complex need child, with the aim of highlighting the risk factors that predisposed our patient to this @di$ infection @/di$ and sharing our experience in the management of this rare bacteria. The @di$ infection @/di$ was treated with intravenous (IV) ampicillin, in addition to salvaging the line.	1
We speculate that the increase of E2 level is attributed to the colonization and functional activities of @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ in the intestines. Furthermore, E2 has been recognized as functionally preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and old laying hens. Previous results have shown that E2 could decrease synthesis of @di$ inflammatory @/di$ cytokines and regulate the OPG/RANKL/RANK system to prevent bone loss. Estrogen deficiency leads to high productions of TNF and RANKL in bone marrow and small intestines. However, probiotics supplements can protect ovariectomized mice from bone lose. These evidences suggest the possible protective effects of probiotics and E2 on bone. Consistently, @gm$ Bacillus subtilis @/gm$ supplement significantly reduced hens' plasma pro-@di$ inflammatory @/di$ factors, IL-1 and TNF-alpha, and increased the OPG gene expression in the present study.	2
When typhoidal @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$-positive points were discovered and mapped, additional swabs were deployed upstream of sewage flow of the positive point. This was repeated systematically until results showed that the swabs were positive downstream and negative upstream of an identifiable point of possible contamination, such as a block of houses sharing a common sewer. This general approach was also used in sampling rivers and streams until a pipe carrying wastewater with human fecal material was identified or septic tanks were observed to be located nearby. In all cases, a team of public health workers was then required to interview the people living at or near the suspected source and to obtain stool samples to confirm bacteriologically the silent excretion. Confirmation of the typhoidal @gm$ Salmonella @/gm$ serovar and bacteriophage type further supported links between clinical isolates and isolates recovered from the environment. Frequently, chronic carriers discovered by this method gave no past medical history of enteric illness, emphasizing the importance of unbiased surveillance approaches. Finally, the utmost care for confidentiality was maintained during these investigations to avoid the social stigmatization of someone being labeled as a chronic @di$ typhoid @/di$ carrier.	0
Within the family Eggerthellaceae, the genus Adlercreutzia did not show an increase, while bacteria of the genus Asaccharobacter, @gm$ Eggerthella @/gm$, Enterorhabdus, and Paraeggerthella increased in abundance (Figure 3L). In particular, the bacteria species Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Assacharobacter WCA-131-CoC-2, @gm$ Eggerthella YY7918 @/gm$, and Enterorhabdus caecimuris were drivers of this increase (Figure S2C), which have been associated with @di$ inflammation @/di$ and infection of the gastrointestinal tract.	1
