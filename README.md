IMicAP: An Intelligent Microbial Application Platform for Knowledge-Driven Microbiome Research

## Abstract
**Background**: The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and disease, yet microbiome research is hindered by fragmented data resources, heterogeneous knowledge structures, and limited analytical integration. However, existing microbial datasets remain diverse, fragmented, and underutilized due to the lack of integrated databases.
**Results**: We present IMicAP, an intelligent microbial application platform that integrates 12 authoritative databases and 35 million PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles into a unified knowledge system. The platform features 5 core modules: 1) a Knowledge Query system for rapid data retrieval; 2) a Knowledge Graph system enabling multi-hop reasoning and hypothesis generation; 3) an Intelligent Question‑Answering system enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation; 4) a Genome Browser system for genomic visualization; 5) a zero-code 16S rRNA Sequencing Analysis system. IMicAP currently covers 594 microbial species and supports confidence-scored microbe-disease and microbe-small molecule associations extracted via state-of-the-art natural language processing models. A case study demonstrates its ability to infer novel functional insights, such as predicting the inhibitory effect of Enterobacter asburiae on inflammatory bowel disease through shared metabolic pathways.
**Conclusions**: IMicAP offers an open-access (https://www.imicap.com:8443), AI-powered framework that bridges the gap between fragmented microbial data and actionable biological knowledge. By facilitating integrated query, reasoning, and analysis, the platform accelerates hypothesis generation and deepens understanding of host-microbiome interactions. Future development will focus on expanding microbial coverage, enhancing reasoning scalability, and building a dual-engine architecture that combines knowledge-driven inference with large-scale data analytics. IMicAP represents a scalable and transformative tool for advancing precision microbiome research.
