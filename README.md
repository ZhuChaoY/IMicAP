## Abstract
**Background**: Microorganisms play a pivotal role in human health and disease, yet microbial research is hindered by fragmented data resources, heterogeneous knowledge representation, and a lack of integrated analytical tools. Existing databases and knowledge graphs often focus narrowly on genomic information, leaving critical metabolomic and literature-based associations underdeveloped, which limits comprehensive exploration of host-microbe interactions and translational applications.

**Results**: We developed the Intelligent Microbial Application Platform (IMicAP), an AI‑driven, open‑access web platform that integrates 12 authoritative microbial databases and extracts literature‑based associations from over 35 million PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles. IMicAP delivers 5 core modules: 1) A Knowledge Query system for rapid data retrieval; 2) A Knowledge Graph system enabling multi-hop reasoning and hypothesis generation; 3) An Intelligent Question‑Answering system enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation; 4) A Genome Browser system for genomic visualization; 5) A zero-code 16S rRNA Sequencing Analysis system. It supports context‑aware exploration of microbial‑disease‑metabolite relations, enables zero‑code omics analysis, and provides an interpretable, retrieval‑augmented Question & Answering interface powered by a domain‑specific knowledge base. The platform currently encompasses 594 microbial species, systematically organized into a structured knowledge network with confidence‑scored associations.

**Conclusions**: IMicAP (available at https://www.imicap.com:8443) is the first comprehensive, open-access, AI-powered microbial platform designed to bridge the gap between fragmented microbial data and actionable biological insights. By facilitating hypothesis generation, multi‑omics integration, and user‑friendly data exploration, IMicAP serves as a versatile resource for advancing microbiome research and translational insights. Future development will focus on expanding microbial coverage, enhancing reasoning scalability through embedding‑based methods, and evolving toward a dual knowledge‑and‑data‑driven architecture to further support mechanistic discovery in microbial systems biology.
